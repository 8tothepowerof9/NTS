    "content": "Chapter 1: Did Someone Hold a Knife to Your Throat?\nWork-life balance. Once a lifestyle value that trended alongside YOLO.\nWhile YOLO had recently become completely outdated, work-life balance was still an expression used from time to time.\nAnd for me, work-life balance was the top priority when choosing my career.\nI never dreamed of becoming incredibly wealthy. No, to be honest, whether it was a major corporation or anywhere else, the possibility of becoming filthy rich through insane amounts of work seemed nonexistent.\nIf I could just earn enough money to take care of myself, I wanted to simply enjoy my hobbies and live a quiet life.\nI was the type who'd rather make $3,000 a month for a 40-hour week than $8,000 for an 80-hour grind.\nAnd back when I was job hunting in the early-to-mid 2010s, the poster child for work-life balance was undeniably a civil servant.\nUnlike private companies, you didn't have to worry about getting fired or the company going bankrupt. While regular office workers were drowning in corporate abuse and overtime, civil servants were known for their strict 6 PM clock-out routine.\nIn short:\n\"Who knew it would be like this? Fuck....\"\nI had been deceived by a vain delusion.\nCivil servants clocking out on the dot? Complete and utter bullshit. It might have been possible in the past, but not now.\nDo you think it's uncomfortable to anxiously watch your boss's mood in a private company, fearing you might get fired?\nI didn't realize back then that while I couldn't get fired, that bastard wouldn’t get fired either.\nOf course, the answer I would get if I dared to say such things in this day and age was obvious.\n—So what? Did someone hold a knife to your throat and force you to become a civil servant?\nYeah. No one held a knife to my throat and forced me.\nI came crawling here on my own two feet because I thought it was a good idea.\nBut, even so.\nIf I knew I was going to die like this, I wouldn't have become a civil servant.\nWhere did it all go wrong?\nWas it when I got caught up in an empty illusion and prepared to become a civil servant?\nWas it when I invested more time in aiming for Grade 7 instead of Grade 9, thinking the salary for Grade 9 was too low?\nWas it when I became unable to quit after spending three years to pass the Grade 7 civil service exam, and slugging through until suddenly becoming a 5-year veteran?\n\"Wonder when I'll get off work today... sigh \"\nI was just grumbling to myself when a noise I knew all too well cut through the air.\n\"S-sir, you can't come in here!\"\n\"If you keep this up, we'll call the police!\"\n\"If you can't do it, call your superior!! Superior!! Before I kill you all, you fucking bitches!!\"\nIt was clear from the sound: a disgruntled civilian.\nWithout much thought, I turned my head toward the noise and saw an elderly man getting into an altercation with people as he tried to force his way in.\nAs bad luck would have it, right when I turned to look, my eyes met with my co-worker, Lee Ji-yeon, who was dealing with the civilian.\n\"Officer Seo Ji-hoon!\"\nThe second she yelled my name, the old guy’s head whipped around to face me.\n‘Great. I've attracted the aggro.'\nThe moment our eyes met, it was obvious that trying to avoid him would only make things worse.\nI turned my head to the side, clinging to the last shred of hope.\n'Wow. Fuck. Now that’s what you call seniority, huh?\nMy superior, the team leader, had already vacated his seat and fled the scene.\n\"Are you the top dog here?\"\nFaced with the elderly man's fierce glare, I internally sighed and approached him.\n\"I’m not in charge, but please calm down and tell me what’s going on. What’s the issue here?\"\nMy question just made him start screaming his head off.\nMore than half his sentences were laced with profanity, making it difficult to understand what he was saying.\nPerhaps to help me understand the situation, Officer Lee Ji-yeon briefly explained, “An official directive came down recently, and the eligibility requirements for basic livelihood security recipients were changed. It's because of that....\"\n\"Ah....\"\nIt seemed he had come to protest his exclusion from the list of basic livelihood security recipients.\nThere was once a trend in movies, dramas, and novels: the rich were evil, and the poor were good.\nBut reality wasn't like that.\nThere's an old saying that you can't be generous on an empty stomach. The anger and unreasonable behavior of those who had no room to spare in their lives were beyond imagination.\n\"You goddamn bastards! Do you know how much I've done for this country, huh? You fucking bitches! Do something about it if you don't want to die! Aren't you guys living off our taxes? Where do you think that money comes from!\"\nThe words \"I pay taxes too\" rose to the tip of my tongue, but I couldn't bring myself to utter them.\nBut perhaps it was due to her lack of experience, Lee Ji-yeon couldn't hold back and retorted.\n“Excuse me?! You think you’re the only one who pays taxes? And who are you calling fucking bitches? Watch your language.\"\nI couldn't help but sigh.\n'She wasn't like this a year ago.'\nThe fresh-faced rookie she was when first assigned here a year ago was long gone.\nShe, who had spent the first month in tears every day after being tormented by complainants, had completely turned dark within three months.\nAnd as her weary face argued with the complainant...\n'Did someone call the police?'\nI silently asked another co-worker, Kim Chang-seok, beside me with my eyes.\n'I called. They'll be here soon.'\nKim Chang-seok's nodding eyes conveyed that meaning.\nHow could we exchange such a conversation with just a look?\nWell, this wasn't exactly our first rodeo.\n'Just need to stall for a little longer.'\nAs I was holding back a sigh and about to turn back to the complainant...\nThud.\nA strange sound reached my ears.\nWhat followed was pain.\n\"Ugh....\"\nThe sudden pain made me double over and look down at my stomach, and I found what looked like a sashimi knife sticking out of my stomach.\n'He... brought a knife?'\nHow did nobody see that?\nThat was the first stupid thing that popped into my head.\nWell, who would ever expect to get stabbed in the middle of their job?\n\"KYAAAAAAH!!\"\nRight after that, Lee Ji-yeon let out a bloodcurdling scream.\n\"Hiiik.\"\nThe guy who stabbed me looked just as surprised as I was, and he yanked the knife out.\n\"Ugh....\"\nAs the knife that had been plugging the hole in my stomach was withdrawn, blood gushed out in waves.\nI hurriedly tried to block the wound with both hands, but I could feel myself getting weaker and weaker.\nEventually, my legs gave way, and I collapsed to the floor as my consciousness slowly faded.\nEarly dawn.\nA young man who had been tossing and turning in his sleep suddenly sat up and kicked off his blanket.\nHe blinked himself awake and grumbled something that sounded way too old for his face.\n\"Ha. It's been a while since I had that dream, but it felt disgustingly real.\"\nSeo Ji-hoon—or rather, Il-mok, as he was known in this place—had experienced something strange a year ago.\nThe moment he woke up, his personality had switched to that of Seo Ji-hoon, a man from modern South Korea.\nAt first, he thought he was dreaming, but as days turned into weeks and months, that thought faded.\n'Reincarnation. No. Possession?'\nIt might have been different had he been this way since he was a baby, but he was already fourteen when he opened his eyes, so it felt closer to possession than reincarnation.\nPerhaps because the memory of dying as Seo Ji-hoon was so vivid, he often had nightmares about that experience even after the possession.\nBut as he got used to living here, he started having them less and less.\nThen today, out of nowhere, he had the dream again for the first time in six months.\n“Tsk. Might as well get to work.”\nHe woke up early in the morning, but because his brain was startled by the nightmare, he couldn't fall back asleep.\nIt had been a year since he woke up in this place. It might seem strange for a fifteen-year-old boy to be working, but it wasn't that unusual in 'this world.'\nThis world, where I was possessed as Il-mok, wasn't modern times.\n'To think I'd wake up in a Murim world...'\nI, who valued work-life balance, enjoyed reading web novels and webtoons. Well, it was closer to enjoying them because my work-life balance wasn't being maintained.\nAs a busy modern person, reading webtoons and web novels during commutes on public transportation helped significantly with stress relief.\nIn any case, thanks to all that reading, I was able to adapt relatively easily despite being punted into a Murim world.\nHonestly, I even thought this.\n'Did I leave a malicious comment on a Murim novel without realizing it?'\nYou know, wondering if I'd been sucked into a novel I'd flamed online.\nBut after doing some digging, I figured out that besides being a generic martial arts world, it had nothing to do with any story I knew. There weren't any protagonists or major villains that I recognized.\nEventually, I gave up such thoughts and adapted to living in this world.\nAs a waiter.\nUnfortunately, Il-mok, whom I possessed, was an orphan.\nFrom what I could recall of Il-mok's memories, he hadn't been an orphan from birth, but had become one just a few months before I arrived.\nThere wasn't much a fourteen-year-old orphan could do to survive, so I had no choice but to choose the profession of a waiter to make a living.\nAnd once I actually started, it wasn't particularly difficult.\nThe two most important things required for a waiter in this world were quick wits and patience.\nFirst, one had to discern a customer's financial resources or abilities based on their appearance, attire, and movements.\nIf you carelessly let in the wrong customer and they decided to dine and dash, the waiter had to bear all the losses.\nOn the other hand, if you judged someone by their ragged clothes and chose to chase them away or ignore them, you could face a great calamity.\nThey might have worn-out clothes covered in dust from a long journey, but chances are, they might be martial masters or someone from an influential family.\nAnd the reason patience was necessary was simple.\nIt was because of the customers' tyranny. And since this was a Murim world, it was practically a lawless zone.\nIn other words, it was a place where it wouldn't be strange to get stabbed in the stomach for talking back to a customer's unreasonable demands.\n‘I already died that way once. I’m not letting it happen again.’\nIn that sense, my abilities honed from 5 years of working as a civil servant were more than enough to be a waiter.\nI had the patience developed from dealing with complainants and the perceptiveness gained from surviving in the damn rigid civil servant environment.\nAnd I made full use of those abilities, starting work from early dawn.\nFirst, I started the day by going out to the courtyard with the sunrise and sweeping the entrance of the inn with a broom.\nAs I returned inside the inn to wipe the tables and clean the floor, I saw Uncle Taehyeon, the innkeeper, coming down.\n\"Hmm? Il-mok. You're up earlier than usual today.\"\n\"I woke up without meaning to, so I thought I'd do some cleaning since I was already up.\"\n\"Hahahaha. If I could find just one more waiter like you, our Cheongpung Inn could become the best inn in Qianyang County.\"\nI smiled faintly at Uncle Taehyeon's words.\nThe main reason I’ve even managed to survive after waking up as a fourteen-year-old orphan is largely due to this man's help.\nBeyond simply hiring me as a servant, he had provided me with a place to sleep and meals as well.\nHe even taught me how to read and write, citing that I should have a more respectable job when I grew up, so where could I find a better benefactor?\nAfter greeting Uncle Taehyeon, I focused on cleaning again until it was time to start the morning business.\nMy routine was simple: take orders from customers visiting the inn, relay them to Uncle—who served as both innkeeper and chef—and deliver the prepared meals to the guests.\nAnd after the customers left, I'd clear the tables and welcome new patrons.\nLike a hamster in its wheel, I repeated these same actions dozens of times.\n\"Phew. Is the morning rush over?\"\nAs the stream of customers finally died down, I wiped my forehead and let out a sigh.\nThe morning shift would end once I cleared away the last customers' dishes. Then there'd be a brief respite before evening service began.\nI briefly considered taking a nap, but I didn't feel the need to.\nEven though being a waiter was a somewhat physically demanding job, I wasn't tired at all.\nOne might think it was because I was used to the work, but it had always been like this since I first started.\n'Is it because I'm young? I don't get tired.'\nEven though I had woken up early and worked after a sleepless night today, I was still full of energy.\nAnd as I was clearing the last remaining table...\n“Bring me a bowl of whatever noodles you can make the fastest.”\nA sudden order came in.\nI certainly hadn't felt anyone enter the inn, but when I looked toward where the voice came from, I saw an old man sitting at a table. The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the novel•fire.net\n'He's a martial artist.'\nI knew instinctively. But that made it even stranger.\nI had seen countless martial artists while working as a waiter, but they all exuded an aura that was difficult to approach.\nHowever, I couldn't feel any presence from this old man.\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nNevertheless, I replied to the old man in a most respectful tone.\nIn this world, ignoring one's instinctive warnings could result in finding oneself at the wrong end of a blade.\n\"Uncle! One order of thin noodles here!\"\nAfter relaying the order to the kitchen, a plate of thin noodles came out of the kitchen a quarter of an hour later, complete with a teapot and teacups.\nCarefully, I placed the noodles and tea on the elder's table and stepped back. The old man took a calm sip of tea, then used his chopsticks to taste the noodles.\nAnd after tasting the tea and noodles, the old man opened his mouth in a calm voice.\n“It’s poisoned. Looks like the Alliance has finally caught my trail.\"\n\"!?\"\nBefore I could even utter the words, What do you mean by that?\nSlash!\nA chilling sound of flesh being cut came from the kitchen.\nHowever, I didn't have the leisure to turn my head in that direction.\nFrom the old man who had shown no presence until now, an overwhelming force like Mount Tai itself began to emanate.\nAnd as the elder fixed his terrifying gaze upon me, an unfamiliar voice spoke from the kitchen.\n\"The tail has been dealt with.\"\n'Tail? You don't mean... Uncle, do you?'\nAs that terrible thought was running through my head, the old man who’d been sizing me up like a piece of meat said something totally random.\n\"Ho? For someone with such a body, working as a server in a place like this seems quite wasteful.\"\n\"??\"\nBefore I could respond to the elder's rather suggestive remark.\nWhoosh.\nThe old man vanished from the table in an instant and appeared right before my face.\nWith a sword already drawn and pointed at my throat.\n\"Choose. Between dying here or become my disciple.\"\nIn the midst of this urgent crisis, with a martial artist pressing a sword to my neck, a rather pointless thought crossed my mind.\n'Was the dream I had this morning a premonition?'\nIt seemed I was, without a doubt, completely fucked.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 2",
    "content": "Chapter 2: Heavenly Demon (天魔)\nSome deranged old man held a sword to my throat while spouting nonsense.\nNormally, I would have immediately knelt and begged for forgiveness. I pretty much threw my pride out the window back when I was a civil servant dealing with Karens. I learned the hard way in my first year that being proud just makes a shitty situation a million times worse.\nHere, it was even more critical. In this world where martial artists ran amok, things didn't just get worse; if you crossed the wrong person, you'd likely end up crippled or dead.\nBut for some reason, my knees refused to bend.\nHow to put it?\nIt was just…fucking infuriating.\nMaybe it was disgust at myself for living years while throwing away my pride.\nOr maybe it was rebellion, a refusal to kneel before those who might have killed Uncle Taeheon, the man who'd cared for me like a father for a year.\nOr perhaps this young body, contrary to reason, was surrendering to primal rage.\nMaybe it was a tangled mess of all these things.\nI honestly don't know why.\nAll I know is my brain was yelling, \"GET ON YOUR KNEES AND BEG!\" but my mouth had other ideas.\n\"What a load of bullshit.\"\nThe old man's eyebrows twitched at my rough speech, but his presence still weighed heavily.\n\"...What did you just say?\"\nBut even with that terrifying presence pressing on my being, my mouth kept running.\n\"You kill someone who was like a father to me, then ask me to become your disciple? If you're going to go crazy, at least do it properly, you senile murderous bastard!!\"\nAfter unleashing a torrent of curses at the old man, I felt a sense of relief.\nSimultaneously, a searing pain shot through my neck.\nAs my vision blurred, a thought crossed my mind.\n'So, I'm dying from a stab wound again.'\nWould this really be the end this time?\nOr will I experience another reincarnation or possession?\nWith these futile thoughts, my consciousness faded.\n\"Ugh...\"\nA pained groan escaped my lips as I opened my eyes to an aching stiffness spreading through my entire body.\nWhat greeted my eyes was an unfamiliar ceiling.\n'Damn. Another possession?'\nBut my hopes were dashed by a voice from beside me.\n\"You're awake.\"\n\"!?\"\nChills instantly ran down my spine.\nThough our conversation had been brief, it was a voice I could never forget. It was the voice of the old man who had plunged a sword into my neck.\n\"H-How...?\"\nResponding to my loaded question, the old man looking down at me asked.\n\"How what?\"\n\"H-how am still I alive?\"\nAs soon as I asked, a horrifying thought occurred to me.\n'Is he not done venting his anger!?'\nMaybe just killing me outright was too boring for him, so he's gonna keep me around and torture me to death for fun!?\nWhile my brain was busy cooking up that nightmare scenario, the old man just burst out laughing.\n\"Hahahaha!\"\nIt was a strange feeling.\nThe old man who had exuded a presence as crushing as a mountain before I lost consciousness was gone.\nDespite having the exact same face and voice, the old man now seemed like a harmless being, devoid of any menacing aura whatsoever.\nPerhaps it was the old man's tranquil demeanor. I managed to gather my wits and survey my surroundings. Fınd the newest release on novel-fire.ɴet\n'A carriage...?'\nIt seemed I was being transported in a carriage with the old man.\nHaving finished his laughter, the old man stroked his long beard with a calm expression and spoke.\n\"First, we need to clear up a misunderstanding.\"\n\"Misunderstanding? What misunderstanding?\"\n\"Hmm. Whether you believe it or not, we did not kill the innkeeper.\"\n\"...\"\nThe mention of Uncle Taehyeon made my expression harden involuntarily.\nIt seemed this young body of mine was unable to easily conceal intense emotional changes.\nWhile I could endure humbling myself, but facing my benefactor’s enemy with a smile was a step too far.\n\"Then who killed him?\"\n\"It was the Murim Alliance.\"\n\"...Are you trying to shift the blame to the Murim Alliance?\"\nThe Murim Alliance was a coalition of righteous sects. While most martial artists in this world could be considered gangsters or thugs in modern terms, the Alliance at least pretended to be the 'good guys.'\nTo frame them implied that this old man was undoubtedly a demonic cult leader or villain with a grudge against them.\n\"On the contrary, the Alliance killed the innkeeper and tried to pin the blame on me.\"\n\"Why would the Alliance do such a thing?\"\n\"Only then could they tarnish my name and unite under a common cause.\"\nHe sounded like a senile old man.\nWho was this old man that the entire Orthodox Faction would unite just to frame him?\nBut recalling the overwhelming presence I'd felt before losing consciousness, it didn't seem entirely nonsensical.\n\"Then, what was that slicing sound from the kitchen?\"\n\"That was the sound of my guard killing the Murim Alliance assassin who murdered the innkeeper. I had no plans to visit that inn. It was a spontaneous decision. It's illogical that the innkeeper would have poison prepared for me as if expecting my arrival.\"\nHaving said this, the old man's eyebrows twitched as if he'd remembered something. He continued in a calm tone, \"Come to think of it, this must be an injustice to both you and the innkeeper. You were caught in this situation simply because I happened to stop by that inn.\"\nSeeing the old man's genuinely apologetic face, I felt a strange mix of emotions.\nDuring my time as a civil servant, apologies like this only emboldened entitled complainers to demand more.\nThis was the perfect moment to lash out at the old man or exploit the situation.\n'Yet, it's similar to my past but entirely different.'\nPerhaps it was because I'd glimpsed the old man's true power.\nIt felt like the final act of kindness from a predator.\nMy instincts screamed that if I mistook his kindness for weakness, I would be torn to shreds.\nTherefore, instead of getting angry, I asked my question in a calm tone.\n“Okay, so why didn't you mention any of this back then? It feels like you fabricated a justification while I was unconscious.\"\nThe old man stroked his beard and replied, \"There are two main reasons. First, there was no time for a lengthy explanation.\"\nSeeing my confused expression, he elaborated.\n\"The poisoned food meant the Alliance was on my trail. Their hounds would soon arrive in droves. While I don't fear them, it wouldn't be easy to fight while protecting a potential disciple I'd taken a liking to.\"\n\"Then why did you force that choice on me?\"\n\"That's the second reason. Despite the time constraints, I wanted to test you.\"\n\"???\"\n\"No matter how talented a child might be in martial arts, if their character is twisted, raising them would only invite disaster. Despite the misunderstanding, I admired your spirit—choosing death over becoming the disciple of one you believed to be your enemy. Hahaha.\"\n\"...\"\nSo, my cursing and defiance had actually impressed him?\nIsn’t this the exact situation like those outdated cliché scenarios from the dramas? Some kind of 'you're the first to treat me this way' scenario?\nBut the absurdity was fleeting.\n'If I'd agreed to become his disciple, I'd be dead?'\nChills ran down my spine once again.\nMy impulsive defiance had inadvertently saved my life.\nAt that point, the old man finished his story and asked, \"Can you understand a little better now?\"\n\"... While I can't fully believe it. It's plausible, I suppose.\"\nAnd it wasn't just because what he said made logical sense.\nThe biggest reason was that he was keeping me alive.\nHe had brought along an inn assistant who had refused to be his disciple and had even spat curses at him. In this world, that seemingly impossible act made it feel as though the old man wasn't someone who killed for the hell of it.\nLost in thought, I suddenly met the old man's gaze fixed on me.\nThey were like a deep and tranquil lake.\nI couldn't fathom its depths, yet it felt like it reflected me entirely, reading my every thought.\nFeeling a strange sense of unease, I spoke with a glimmer of hope.\n\"However, I still don't completely believe you. Therefore, I cannot become your disciple. If you would let me off here, I will return to my village and investigate what happened at the inn.\"\nWhether the old man was telling the truth or not, I wanted no part in the affairs of the martial world.\nIt was a ruthless world where people died left and right.\nI longed for a peaceful and stable work-life balance, a life of moderate work and leisure.\nBut the old man, who had been conversing amicably until now, firmly shook his head.\n\"Impossible.\"\n\"...May I ask why?\"\n\"It's simple. Why would I have brought you here if I didn't intend for you to become my disciple?\"\n\"...\"\nBecause you kidnapped me to force me into servitude?\n…is what I could not bring myself to say out loud.\nThough the old man was frightening, something about the situation didn't add up.\nIf he truly intended to force me into becoming his disciple, there would have been no reason for such kindness.\nAs I met the old man’s gaze, which seemed to be waiting for me to find the answer myself, I soon reached a conclusion of my own.\n\"Is it to prevent me from being killed by the Murim Alliance like Uncle Taeheon?\"\n\"Exactly. With you alive as a witness, their plan to frame me will be disrupted. They are the type who would kill you too and pin everything on me, with plenty of accusations to spare.\"\n\"I swear I will never utter a word to incriminate you. In fact, I will remain silent about you and live in hiding. So, please, let me...\"\n\"The Alliance's surveillance is more extensive than you think. And no matter how righteous one's heart may be, the body can betray it. Do you think you can withstand their torture if they capture you, pull out your fingernails and toenails, sear your flesh with hot irons, and flay your skin piece by piece until you confess?\"\n\"...\"\nI couldn't bring myself to say yes.\nThere was no way in hell I could lie to myself and pretend I could survive that kind of torture. It was impossible.\nAs if reading my thoughts, the old man sealed the conversation.\n\"The moment you became entangled with me, you were left with only two choices: to join me or to be hunted by the Alliance for the rest of your life, eventually ending up tortured and killed in their prison.\"\n\"...\"\nI'd stepped in shit. Not just any shit, but a world drowning in it.\nNo, wait. I hadn't stepped in it.\nThe moment this old man entered the inn, the entire world had turned to shit.\nBut now that my choices were reduced to one, my thoughts were simplified despite the injustice and frustration.\nIf there were no other options, I had to make the best of the remaining one.\n“Is becoming your disciple the only option I have left?”\n\"Indeed.\"\n\"Then, may I ask for the esteemed name of the one who might become my master?\"\nI needed to know if the rope I was grabbing was a lifeline or a rotten thread.\n\"Hahaha. Esteemed name. Your tone has changed.\"\n\"Ahem...\"\n\"I was jesting. My name is Hyeokryeon Il-hwi (赫連日輝).\"\nUpon hearing the old man's name, I nearly caught myself tilting my head in confusion.\nIf I pretended this was my first time hearing it, it might offend him.\nA man who claimed the entire Murim Alliance was after him must possess considerable ego.\nTo admit I did not know the name of such a man could easily offend him. That was how most martial artists think.\nBut perhaps my acting was unconvincing. The old man smiled faintly and spoke again.\n\"Hahaha. It's true that in the Central Plains, my title is more widely known than my name. In Jianghu, they call me the Heavenly Demon.\"\nHeavenly Demon (天魔).\nThat was the title of the old man who had turned my world into shit.",

    "novel_title": "So, Did Someone Force You to Become the Heavenly Demon",
    "chapter_number": "Chapter 3",
    "content": "Chapter 3: Cult (似而非)\nI knew exactly what the title ‘Heavenly Demon’ meant.\nIn most martial arts novels, it signified overwhelming martial prowess, often attributed to the protagonist or the ultimate antagonist. Above all, it referred to the leader of a group commonly referred to as the \"Demonic Cult.\"\nWhile the Demonic Cult boasted various names depending on the story—Sun Moon Divine Cult, Ming Cult, Sacred Flame Cult, Heavenly Demon Divine Cult—the underlying meaning remained consistent: the leader of a heretical cult, one that possesses monstrous strength.\n'So, essentially, I'm becoming the disciple of a cult leader?'\nThis also implied the possibility of inheriting leadership in the future.\n‘It’s… quite good?’\nAs someone who valued a stable and peaceful life, my feelings were ambivalent.\nAnd then I started thinking about all those cult leaders I'd occasionally seen in modern news reports.\n'...Maybe it's not so bad?'\nWhile their countless crimes were undeniably reprehensible, I figured so long as I avoided criminal activities, I could live an easy life. All I had to do was make occasional appearances on service days, spout some nonsense, and put on a show of shooting energy blasts or performing fake spiritual possessions.\nCome to think of it, in this world, energy blasts were real. I wouldn't even have to fake it. Genuine energy blasts and aerial feats of lightness were entirely possible. If people in the scientifically advanced modern world went crazy over fake shows, imagine how it would be here.\n'Ah, is that why the Heavenly Demons in these novels were a bunch of overpowered characters?'\nLost in contemplation about the correlation between the cult and the martial arts prowess of Heavenly Demons, I belatedly realized that the cult leader—no, my future Master—was observing me intently.\n\"My apologies. I was taken aback by the unexpected title and behaved discourteously.\"\n“Hahaha. How could something like that be considered a discourtesy?” My Master chuckled warmly, stroking his beard before uttering an unexpected remark.\n\"Rather, you are quite unique.\"\n\"...In what way, sir?\"\n\"I'm referring to your reactions. Though you seemed slightly surprised when you first woke up, you quickly composed yourself. Where others might show fear or anger, you sought logical conversation. And it's the same even now. Instead of fearing my title, you appear deep in thought.\"\n\"I... It's just that these events are so far beyond my expectations that they haven't fully sunk in.\"\n\"Hahaha. I’m not criticizing you. Your profound mind and calm demeanor for your age are quite pleasing. I'm merely pleased that my eyes haven't failed me.\"\nAt first, he praised my body.\nWhile the phrasing was somewhat odd, he likely didn't mean it that way. It seemed this body was likely one that was very well-suited for learning martial arts. He tested my character with a bizarre threat, and now he admired my deep thinking and composure.\nWell, my body might be fifteen, but my mind was thirty-four. It was only natural.\n‘Somehow, I feel like his rose-colored glasses are only getting thicker.’\nI couldn't shake the feeling that escaping this Heavenly Demon's grasp was becoming increasingly impossible. However, the life of a cult leader seemed rather appealing. It would be a different story if I had to build up a cult from scratch, but inheriting an established one promised a life of comfort and ease.\nReaching this conclusion, I hurriedly opened my mouth. \"Ah, I seem to have delayed my introduction. My name is Il-mok (一木).\" It was a basic courtesy to share my name after learning his.\n\"Hmm. Il-mok... The surname Il (一) is unfamiliar to me.\"\n\"It's not a surname in the traditional sense. The character 'Il' means first son, and Mok (木) is one of the few Hanja characters my parents know.\"\nIlliteracy was commonplace in this era of disparate education. It wasn't unusual for many people to know few or no characters at all.\n\"Huh. What became of your parents? You referred to the innkeeper like a ‘father,' suggesting he wasn't your biological father.\"\n\"They passed away about a year ago. Afterward, he took me in, providing food and shelter in exchange for work, and even taught me some characters.\"\n\"He even taught you characters...\" The Heavenly Demon regarded me with pity.\n\"Upon returning to the cult, I shall investigate this matter. At the very least, we must identify those who murdered your father figure. If you want, I’ll give you the chance to get your own vengeance. If not, I’ll send my men to do it for you.”\n\"...Weren't the assassins already killed at the inn?\" I asked hesitantly and the Heavenly Demon responded with a gentle smile.\n\"Hahaha. That man was merely following orders. Who says revenge is done when you break the sword in half? You have to go after the man who swung it.”\n\"By those who swung the sword, you mean...\"\n\"Those who pursued me and those who ordered the massacre at the inn. All must be found and eliminated.\"\n\"...\" I just stared at the Heavenly Demon, who was cheerfully promising mass murder.\n'...Is it too late to escape now?'\nA Demonic Cult was, after all, a Demonic Cult.\nIt goes without saying, but escape was an impossible task.\nThe carriage held a formidable martial artist, my kidnapper, and potentially my future Master.\nThe driver, as I later learned, was the man who dispatched the Murim Alliance assassin at the inn, meaning any escape attempt would likely mirror that unfortunate fellow's fate. It was illogical for a Heavenly Demon's escort to be weak.\nAnd so, with mixed feelings of strange excitement and anxiety about becoming a cult leader, I continued the carriage journey.\nEventually, I arrived at the main headquarters of the Heaven Demon Sect. I must have been unconscious for quite some time.\nUpon our arrival, two gatekeepers prostrated themselves before the Heavenly Demon the moment he disembarked. \"We greet the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons!\"\nThis fervent display wasn't limited to the gatekeepers.\n\"We greet the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons!\"\n\"Oh, savior!\"\n\"O’ Heavenly Demon!\"\nEvery person we saw basically threw themselves onto the floor and started praying to him.\nAnd the man himself, the target of all this worship, just smiled calmly and soaked it all in with a gentle smile.\nWatching all this go down as I trailed behind the Heavenly Demon, I was deeply impressed.\n'So this is what it’s like to be a cult leader?'\nIt was a rather overwhelming sight, but…\n'This is actually pretty awesome.'\nIt was truly a sight that embodied absolute power.\nEven more remarkable was how everyone, though casting curious glances at me following behind the Heavenly Demon, dared not question his judgment. The atmosphere suggested they simply accepted that the great Heaven Demon must have his reasons for bringing me along.\nAfter basking in the Heavenly Demon's aura while traversing the compound, we stopped before a building bearing the inscription \"Windrock Palace (風岩殿).\"\n“You must be tired from traveling for so long in a body that has not even learned martial arts. Rest here for the day.\"\nTouched by his consideration, I made a decision. \"Thank you, sir. No, from now on, I shall address you as Master.\"\nMaybe it was the sudden shift in address, but my new Master stroked his beard and gave me an interested look. \"Have you finally decided?\"\n\"Yes, Master. As you said, if this is my only option, dedicating myself here is the right path.\"\n\"Hahaha. Wisely chosen.\"\nTo solidify my commitment, I spoke. \"Then, though belated, may I offer my formal bow now?\"\nTypically, when one thinks of the kowtow given to a master, the images that pop into their head are the ones depicted by historical drama. However, this was a common misconception.\nKowtow itself encompassed nine forms of bowing, and the one reserved for superiors like masters, parents, or rulers was called grand kowtow.\nAs I knelt and performed the bow, Master erupted in hearty laughter. “Hahahaha! It seems I have gained a truly magnificent disciple in my twilight years.”\nHe then instructed me to rise, adding a final remark. “Since I must attend to the Cult’s affairs, I can’t be with you constantly. Therefore, I shall assign you a handmaid. She will assist you and teach you the ways of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\"\nFor a guy in charge, he sure was long-winded, but I was hanging on every word.\n'A handmaid...'\nI, a South Korean civil servant who had endured workplace bullying, now had a subordinate.\nWhile I had no intention of mistreating her, the situation felt surreal.\n'Life is all about connections.' And having the cult leader as my Master was the ultimate connection.\nShortly after my busy Master departed, a melodious voice echoed from the entrance.\n\"Young Master Il-mok. Following the Heavenly Demon's will, I, Jin Hayeon (陳赮蓮), have come to attend to your needs.\"\nHer enchanting voice made my heart flutter.\nI responded in a deliberately calm tone, \"You may enter.\"\nStill unaccustomed to authoritative speech, I addressed my maid with respect.\nAnd the woman who opened the door and entered, contrary to her name which meant ‘read lotus,’ had snow-white skin and strikingly black hair and eyebrows.\nShe was like a doll.\n'Holy...'\nShe’s the most beautiful woman I've ever encountered in my life.\nShe’s the kind of beauty you'd expect to see on TV—possessing looks that had absolutely no connection to my reality.\nIt wasn't as though I'd never dated in my thirty-four years. I thought I'd built up enough immunity to women, but this was different. Here was a woman whose beauty made even striking up a conversation seem daunting, and she was to be my maid?\n'Master. Just what kind of life have you been living?\nIf a mere disciple of the cult leader was treated to this, what kind of life did the cult leader himself lead?\nMy mind kept conjuring endless rose-tinted futures.\nEven as I tried to press the mental pause button to calm myself down, the movie in my head quickly resumed, already fast-forwarding to scenes where I was contemplating names for our second child.\nThat's when she opened her mouth with a cold expression.\n\"I understand from the Heavenly Demon that you turned fifteen this year.\"\nStarting with age... well, age mattered between men and women. However, while my body was fifteen, my mind was in its mid-thirties. Our future interactions (?) should pose no significant problems.\n\"Indeed,\" I replied confidently.\n\"Then, next year, when you turn sixteen, you must enter the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\n\"What is the Hall of the Demonic Way?\"\n\"It is an institution where the most exceptional children of cult members and their offspring are selected and trained to become future leaders of our Divine Cult. Entry is granted to those who turn sixteen each year.\"\nIn short, an elite training ground.\n'Hmm... A place to learn martial arts. Like a military academy?'\nPondering this, I asked Jin Hayeon, \"Then, as the Heavenly Demon's disciple, can I enter without taking the test?\"\n\"Even as the Heavenly Demon's disciple, you must pass the entrance examination.\"\n\"...If it's a place for only the most exceptional, doesn’t that mean they’ve all been training for this for years?”\n\"That is correct.\"\n\"...And I'm expected to enter in just one year?\"\n\"That is correct,\" she replied with an impassive tone.\n\"Isn't that a rather unreasonable requirement?\"\n\"It is precisely because you have only one year that the expectation is merely to 'pass.' Among the Heavenly Demon's disciples, none have failed to enter as the top scorer or graduate as such.\" Newest update provıded by Novᴇl_Fire(.)net\nHer detached response highlighted a crucial fact: I wasn't the Heavenly Demon's only disciple. In other words, there was no guarantee that I would become the cult leader..\n\"What happens if I fail to enter the Hall of the Demonic Way?\"\n\"You will die.\"\nApparently, even being the cult leader's disciple wasn't a walk in the park.",

    "content": "Chapter 4: Test Taker (1)\n\"Die? What do you mean I will die? Are you saying my Master intends to kill me if I fail?\"\nWhether I was freaking out over this completely insane situation didn’t matter, she remained characteristically composed.\nThat incredibly beautiful, bell-like voice of hers spoke again.\n\"How could the Savior and Lord of Ten Thousand Demons harm his own disciple?\"\nYet, her heavenly voice was devoid of emotion, cold and detached.\n\"However, it is unthinkable that the disciple chosen by the Lord would be incompetent. I, who have failed to properly guide that disciple, will forfeit my life.\"\nShe spoke of her own death with chilling indifference.\nNo, not indifference. Deep within her seemingly emotionless eyes, a flicker of madness resided.\n“But even if I were to die, the fault of having taken on an incompetent disciple would not be washed away.”\nI had forgotten.\nBefore being my attendant, this woman of striking beauty was first and foremost...\n\"If I am to die, shouldn't I erase the Supreme One's shame by killing Young Master Il-mok and accepting the brand of heretic rather than letting you remain a stain?\"\n...was a fanatic, deeply indoctrinated into this dubious cult.\nHer chillingly logical words felt like a splash of cold water to my head. My idyllic dreams of becoming a cult leader and living a life of luxury evaporated, leaving behind a clarity of mind.\n\"Then there's no time to waste. First, what kind of tests must I pass to enter this Hall of the Demonic Way?\"\nIn short, I was back to being a student preparing for an exam.\nHaving endured the student life twice already—once in high school and again while studying for the civil service exam—this wasn't particularly daunting. Well, except for the minor detail that failure this time meant losing my head.\nHowever, the core objective remained the same: pass the exam.\nAnd any good test-taker knows the most important thing is having a strategy. Especially with a tight one-year deadline, I needed to devise the most efficient plan possible.\nHowever, her response to my question was utterly baffling.\n\"You can’t. The Heavenly Demon has ordered rest for Young Master, and I must obey.\"\nThen maybe you shouldn't have just told me I'd be dead in a year if I don't study! It was an absurd sophistry.\nHad I still been a civil servant or a waiter in that inn, I might have succumbed to such illogical arguments. But things were different now.\nI might be on a one-year death sentence, but I was still the disciple of the cult leader this woman worshipped as a god. And I knew precisely the magic words to use when a subordinate was being difficult.\n\"So, if I rest today and fail the exam, will you take responsibility?\"\n— So, if things go wrong, will you take the responsibility? ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ novel-fire.ɴet\nThe ultimate phrase of those shitheads from my past life. It was the very question that had plagued me endlessly in my past life, and now, ironically, it was coming from my own mouth.\nHer response was delivered with an impassive tone. \"As I said, if you fail, I will forfeit my life.\"\nShe spoke as if offering a meaningful sacrifice, but her naivety was almost comical.\n\"Is this an issue that can be resolved by just one person like you dying? This concerns tarnishing the Cult Leader's legacy. Are you saying it can be resolved with the life of a mere attendant? Truly, is Master's reputation worth only that much to you?\"\n—Do you think taking the fall alone will solve this?\nOnce this line of attack is deployed, no one can escape the clutches of responsibility.\nAnd as I expected, her eyes trembled momentarily, as if she hadn't anticipated this far.\n\"That is why I said I will bear the mark of a traitor to kill Young Master.\"\nShe again resorted to threatening my life.\nOnce, this might have terrified me. But having already died once and having faced a trial from my Master, a far more dangerous individual, this threat held no weight to me.\n\"Hmph. If you put it that way, that would just mean Master was stupid enough to assign a murderous traitor to be my attendant. Are you saying my Master made a stupid decision?”\n\"!!!\"\nHer eyes widened in a flash of realization.\nBut it was fleeting.\nShe became flustered, caught between prioritizing the Heavenly Demon's order for me to rest and the urgency of my training.\nSeeing she might fall into the martial artists' infamous state of Qi Deviation if left alone, I offered her a way out.\n\"I'm not saying I want to start studying and training today. I simply want to understand the nature of the tests so I can formulate a plan. Wouldn't sitting quietly and making plans count as a form of rest?\"\nAfter a moment's contemplation, she finally raised the white flag.\n\"Young Master is correct.\"\nShe gave a nod and finally started explaining the entrance test.\n\"The Hall of the Demonic Way entrance examination consists of two stages. The first assesses martial arts proficiency through a duel with an instructor. The second evaluates faith through an interview with an instructor.\"\nThe description reminded me of the police civil service exam.\n'So it's basically an interview and physical fitness test.'\nAt least there wasn't a written exam.\n\"Then I need to prepare for the interview and the duel.\"\n\"Indeed, Young Master.\"\n\"Can you tell me what kind of questions are asked in the interview?\"\n“The questions are primarily centered on the doctrines written in our Heavenly Demon Divine Cult’s scripture, the Secret Record of the Heavenly Demon, and interpretations of them, as well as questions regarding the laws and history of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.”\n\"So, I need to memorize the scriptures, the laws, and the historical records.\"\nWhen Jin Hayeon shook her head at my words, I asked again. \"Are there other materials I need to study besides those three?\"\n\"That's not what I meant. Simply memorizing the scripture isn't enough. You must deeply embrace the teachings in your heart to truly understand its verses.\"\nLike a true zealot, she was spouting nonsensical rhetoric.\nBut as the disciple of a cult leader, I couldn't exactly contradict her. I decided to play along.\n\"I understand. In any case, can you tell me the approximate volume of these three texts combined?\"\n\"Around five hundred pages.\"\nI nodded to myself.\n'The interview shouldn't be a problem.'\nFive hundred pages in a year. A thousand pages, counting both sides. Having memorized seven subjects for the Level 7 civil service exam, this was a paltry amount.\nSince the interview portion seemed manageable, I asked her about the schedule for martial arts training.\n\"How will we proceed with training for the duel?\"\n\"The Heavenly Demon himself will oversee your martial arts training. However, due to his busy schedule, he will only be available to instruct you once a day during the Hour of the Rooster (5 PM to 7 PM). Outside of those hours, I will teach you external arts and serve as your sparring partner.\"\n(TL Note: External Arts = Gyms)\nAfter exchanging a few more Q&As with her, I nodded and gave her instructions.\n\"Very well. Could you bring me some ink and paper?\"\nWithout question, she bowed her head in her usual stoic manner. With the ink and paper she brought, I began jotting things down.\n'First, training time with Master is fixed. This is something I can't change.'\nIf anything, it was similar to attending lectures during my exam preparation days. My Master was the leader here, so his lessons were like those of a top-tier instructor.\nI had to adapt to his schedule; I couldn't skip his lessons to accommodate my own schedule.\n[Hour of the Rooster (酉時) - Martial arts training with Master]\nI wrote this in the middle of the blank page and then added entries above and below.\n[Hour of the Hare (卯時, 5 AM - 7 AM) - Wake up, eat, cultivate internal energy]\n[Hour of the Dragon, Hour of the Snake (辰時, 巳時, 7 AM - 11 AM) - Review and interview preparation]\n[Hour of the Horse (午時, 11 AM - 1 PM) - Lunch and cultivate internal energy]\n[Hour of the Goat (未時, 1 PM - 3 PM) - External arts training]\n…\n[Half Hour of the Pig (亥時 半, 9:30 PM -10:30 PM) - Review and sleep]\nWhat I had written down was essentially a daily schedule.\nThere was a common saying among students: Instead of wasting time organizing your desk and making schedules, just open your books and study.\nThat’s good advice for the people who are so lazy and scared of starting that they’ll do literally anything else but study.\nBut it didn't apply to me. It wasn't that my willpower was exceptional. With my life potentially on the line in a year, how could I lack willpower?\nI created a schedule not for motivation but for efficiency. To survive the next year, I needed to optimize my every waking hour. Furthermore, I needed to form habits.\nHumans are inherently lazy. Given the choice, most would prefer to do nothing but relax, barring a few workaholics or the gym bros. Therefore, I needed to instil good habits while my willpower was strong and the threat to my life was fresh in my mind.\nBy following a set schedule for over a month, the body naturally adapts. Even when thoughts of laziness crept in, the body would automatically awaken and prepare for the day's activities.\nBut when Jin Hayeon looked at my finished schedule, she frowned.\n\"Is something the matter?\"\n\"Contrary to your earlier question about responsibility, you seem rather relaxed.\"\nShe pointed to the beginning and end of my schedule. \"Are you confident you can pass the exam while sleeping for seven hours a day?\"\n\"You speak foolishly. The examination is not tomorrow but a year from now. The body recovers through sleep, and the mind is no exception. Reducing sleep to study more might be effective for a day or two, but in the long run, studying with adequate rest is far more efficient.\"\nThere were sayings among past examinees: Four hours of sleep, you pass; five hours, you fail. Or even more extreme: Three hours of sleep, you pass; four hours, you fail.\nTo put it bluntly, it was complete bullshit.\nThose only work for the ones who need to cram the night before the exam. For those who have already completed the curriculum, you shouldn’t cut your sleeping hours, as a clear and sharp mind is crucial during the exam.\nOf course, a few rare individuals could function on minimal sleep. These outliers often tout their achievements as the result of reducing their sleep hours and hard work, perpetuating the myth that sacrificing sleep equates to diligence.\nBut for the vast majority, drastically reducing sleep only led to physical and mental deterioration, not adaptation.\nThat didn't mean one should oversleep either.\nFor the body to recover, the optimal amount of sleep varies by individual but generally falls between six to eight hours. In particular, the period between 10 PM and 2 AM was said to be when the body recovers most effectively. Above all, maintaining a regular sleep schedule was crucial. Once the body becomes accustomed to specific sleeping and waking times, it naturally prepares itself, making it easier to achieve quality sleep.\nThese scientific reasons were why I had set exactly 10 PM to 5 AM as sleeping hours.\nStudying should be approached scientifically.\nHowever, such logic rarely resonated with fanatics.\n\"That is merely an excuse. If you truly believe in the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons and devote yourself entirely to the cult's doctrines, you can achieve anything.\"\nShe seemed to believe that fervent prayer and sleepless devotion to the Heavenly Demon would guarantee success.\nHer delusional faith brought a wry smile to my face.\n“And if I do that and still fail, can you take responsibility?”\n\"...\"\n\"No, according to your logic, if I just work haaard enough, I'll pass the exam thanks to my Master's grace. By the same length, if I fail, wouldn't that also be my Master's fault?\"\n\"...\"\nAfter being momentarily stunned by this renewed question of responsibility, she coldly retorted\n\"Then, Young Master, can you take responsibility if your complacency leads to failure? Just as my life is insufficient to atone for besmirching the Heavenly Demon's name, your death alone cannot erase the shame he would bear.\"\nI almost burst out laughing at her audacity.\nHow dare this novice who just learned about the art of blame-shifting try to use that technique against someone who had been hammered with it for five years?\nPlease. Time for the ultimate trump card against the ‘responsibility’ attack.\n\"If you're so opposed to my methods, let's just quit. If you interfere with my plan and force me to stay awake when I need to sleep, I'll simply give up on everything. We can just smear shit on my Master's face and die together.\"\nIn other words: I don’t give a flying fuck about it.",

    "content": "Chapter 5: Test Taker (2)\nHolding someone accountable only works on those who possess a sense of responsibility. Or at least, it worked on those who \"didn't want to get fired\" or \"wanted to climb the corporate ladder.”\nIt's utterly useless against someone already determined to quit or one who has long given up on promotion.\nThat's just how the world works. The desperate ones always end up getting dragged along. Even in college group projects, the one frantic about grades ends up shouldering the entire burden. Ironically, those who've already resigned themselves to poor marks often get a free ride.\nAnd let's be honest, in this situation, I'm the one who's desperate. Not her.\nIt's my neck on the line. And call me crazy, but I think my neck is pretty damn important.\nJin Hayeon, on the other hand, was a zealot willing to throw her life away for the Heavenly Demon and his teachings.\nNevertheless, I could make this bold gamble for two main reasons.\nFirst, as a zealot, she valued the Heavenly Demon's reputation—and thus my acceptance into the Hall of the Demonic Way—more than her own survival.\nSecond, I am the Heavenly Demon's disciple.\n'She can threaten to kill me all she wants, but that also means she can't touch me until I fail the Hall of the Demonic Way examination.'\nOf course, this second reason was mere conjecture, not a certainty.\nIf I was wrong, there was a very real chance she'd just decide to torture me into studying.\nThe ominous thought sent a shiver down my spine, but I masked my fear.\nNo matter what, my life hung in the balance.\nEntrusting my life to a lunatic? Unacceptable.\nI managed to keep my poker face while we had a silent stare-down for a minute.\n\" Sigh ... We will proceed with training according to your schedule, Young Master.\"\nShe finally yielded.\nThe downside was that now she seemed to look at me with even more ice in her eyes.\nI spoke to her in a placating manner as if granting her a favor.\n\"Don't worry. This won't be the permanent schedule until the examination. I plan to make adjustments monthly. For example, if interview preparation is lacking, we'll adjust physical training time, and if combat preparation is insufficient, we'll adjust study time. If both are lacking, then we'll reduce the time from other areas.\"\nI presented it as a compromise, but it was my intention all along.\nThat's how exam preparation works. Things never go exactly according to the initial plan. Some subjects inevitably progress faster than others.\nThus, adjustments are necessary.\nSeemingly satisfied with my proposal, Jin Hayeon relented.\n\"Understood. Then, I would appreciate it if you would modify the schedule through 'consultation' with me after each month.\"\nShe particularly emphasized the word 'consultation.'\nFollowing the nerve-wracking negotiation with Jin Hayeon, I finally began my rest as instructed by my Master.\nResting while being served by a fanatic who threatened my life a year from now was a surreal experience.\nBut my 'body' was comfortable, at least.\n“I will prepare your meal.”\n“Is the heat bothering you?”\nFrom preparing meals to even fanning me, she attended to my every need. However, being the recipient of such service was agonizing. I couldn't shake the ominous feeling that she might be up to something.\n\"Before you retire for the night, would you like to bathe?\"\n\"I would.\"\n\"Then, I shall prepare a warm bath.\"\nWith those words, she left and returned shortly.\n\"The bath is ready, Young Master.\"\nI followed her to the bathing area.\nSteam rose from the warm bath.\n'Finally, some relief for my weary body.'\nI'd been so tense all day my muscles were one giant knot. I figured a hot bath would help, but as I started to get undressed, I noticed something weird.\n\"What are you doing standing there for?\"\nShe was just standing there, staring blankly at me.\n\"I'm here to assist with your bath.\"\n\"!!!\"\nStunned by the unexpected turn of events, I half-mindedly followed her instructions.\n\"Please undress and enter the bath. I will apply the soap for you.\"\nMaintaining a shred of composure, I removed my outer garments, leaving only my undergarments, and stepped into the bath.\nShe then began to carefully lather my body with soap.\nStarting with my arms, I felt the gentle touch of both the soap and her fingers against my skin.\nThrough her now-dampened clothes, hints of flesh occasionally showed through as she went about washing me.\nIt was a situation that should have sent blood rushing to certain areas, but it didn't.\nGulp\nI swallowed hard, but not from impure thoughts. It was from sheer terror.\nAfter all, the assassin who had declared she would kill me in a year was now observing my bare body with detached eyes.\nEach time she applied soap to my body, I imagined her saying:\n'A strike here would paralyze your arm.'\n'Stabbing here would kill you instantly, but I won't grant you such a swift death.'\nThough I knew she wouldn't act before I fail the Hall of the Demonic Way entrance exam...\n‘Could you at least try not to look like you're dissecting a frog?’\nShe continued applying soap while examining my body with the clinical detachment of a graduate student performing a dissection.\nAs planned, I went to bed at half past the Hour of the Pig (10:30 PM) and woke at the Hour of the Hare (5:00-7:00 AM). After light stretching and tidying my bed, I began my morning studies.\nI hadn't learned any martial arts yet, so there was no need for meditative breathing exercises. After washing up, I ate the breakfast Jin Hayeon prepared and immediately started studying.\n'It might not be the most efficient, but it's better than doing nothing.'\nJust because one wakes up doesn't mean their brain is fully alert. Typically, it takes 2-3 hours after waking for the brain to become fully activated.\nThat's why examinees were advised to wake up around 7:00 AM, even if the exam was at 10:00 AM, to prepare and do some light review before the test, rather than sleeping in until 8:00 or 9:00 AM.\nThirty minutes of review wouldn't magically improve years of study. The real purpose was to jolt the brain awake.\nAs I was lightly exercising to wake up my still-drowsy mind, Jin Hayeon brought a book and placed it on the desk.\n\"Then, I shall now begin teaching you about the doctrines of our Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\"\nThe time for my first religious study session had arrived. I almost gulped audibly.\n'Stay focused.'\nThere's a saying that even in a tiger's den, one can survive if they keep their wits with them. Latest content publıshed on noⅴelfire.net\nBut this place was the headquarters of a cult, no less.\nAnd if you know anything about modern cults, you know that \"study sessions\" are where the brainwashing happens.\nOne moment of carelessness, and I might end up becoming exactly like the woman teaching me.\nPerhaps due to the tension, my drowsy mind snapped to attention.\nMistaking my apprehension for attentiveness, she nodded and handed me the scripture.\n\"Haven't you wondered, Young Master, why we call ourselves the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult?”\n“Indeed, the inclusion of the character ma (Demon, 魔) does give it an ominous feel.”\n\"There's a reason for that.\"\nI nodded.\nWhat cult doesn't have its reasons? The problem lies in their twisted logic and sophistry.\nTaking my nod as encouragement, she continued.\n\"All humans are inherently evil. Even the ancient Confucian scholar Xunzi said as much. And indeed, countless corrupt officials oppress innocent commoners. This is not someone's fault but the natural order.\"\nOh, for heaven’s sake. They’re even bringing up Xunzi?\n\"To protect the common people from such oppression, force is necessary. To save all sentient beings in the future, we need the power to destroy the existing order, and those who uphold that order will call this power 'Demonic.' Young Master, have you heard of Maitreya?\"\n\"I have.\"\n\"The Maitreya we speak of is none other than the Heavenly Demon of our cult. However, the Buddhist monks deceive the masses with their sophistry. How can mere sermons reform those born evil?\"\nNow she's bringing in Buddhism and Maitreya as well?\n'As expected, a cult is still a cult.'\nEven modern cults mostly spread their doctrines using the Christian Bible as their foundation.\nThey mostly interpret the scripture according to their whims, creating absurd rules to deceive their followers.\n“And that’s why the world needs the Heavenly Demon. He’s a Demon sent by Heaven itself to tear down the old system and keep the evil inside all of us in check. Indeed, the Heavenly Demon is a 'Demon' because he alone will bear the burden of the evil inherent in all of us.\"\nThey even incorporated Christian doctrine? It sounded like a twisted version of Jesus dying for humanity's sins.\nI felt like my brain was going to melt if she kept talking, so I quickly cut in.\n\"So, the doctrine of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult is that the Heavenly Demon will overthrow the existing order and bring salvation to the masses?\"\n\"You understand perfectly. Our Heavenly Demon Divine Cult originated from the belief that all humans are equal.\"\nHer previously emotionless face lit up with apparent joy at my quick comprehension.\nBut my instincts were screaming.\nThis wasn't just a cult; it was a rebellious faction plotting treason.\nThen, something clicked.\n'This is eerily similar to Donghak...'\nIt resembled the ideology of the Donghak Peasant Movement, also known as the Donghak Peasant Revolution.\nNot that I'm suggesting Donghak was a cult.\nBut the similarities were striking: the emphasis on human equality, much like Donghak's core tenet of \"In-Nae-Cheon\" (Humans are Heaven), and the founder Choe Je-u's mission to save the ignorant masses.\nNot to mention their shared goal of eliminating corrupt officials, albeit through violence rather than sermons.\n\"By any chance, has the Imperial Court branded the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult as heretical rebels for deceiving the public?\"\n\"...How did you know about events from over two hundred years ago?\"\n\"...\"\nUhh… because I had to memorize the entirety of Korean history to pass a government exam?\nBut that wasn't the main point right now.\n‘I had my suspicions, but they were really branded as rebels.’\nThe Heavenly Demon Divine Cult wasn't just a cult; it was a cult of rebels.\nAnd I had become the disciple of their leader.\n'...If I plead that I was coerced at swordpoint, would I get a reduced sentence?'\nProbably not.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 6",
    "content": "Chapter 6: Demonic Arts (1)\nMaster's words were true indeed.\nThe moment our fates intertwined, I was destined to be hunted and killed by the Murim Alliance or to suffer the same end at the hands of the Imperial Court.\nThe only remaining option was to survive as Master's disciple, but even this wasn't entirely smooth. I could still die in a year.\nWith renewed urgency, I focused on the lesson.\nThe doctrines of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult were entirely new to me, yet I quickly grasped her explanations.\nIt wasn't because I was particularly smart.\nIt was because I was accustomed to studying.\n'Comparing it to Donghak makes it surprisingly easy to understand.'\nOne of the best methods for learning something new is connecting it to existing knowledge.\nThis is why lecturers, professors, and teachers often use analogies in their lessons.\nThe human brain is more adept at learning interconnected concepts than entirely isolated ones.\nOf course, the doctrines of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult weren't identical to those of Donghak. And I hadn't memorized all of Donghak's principles either.\nWhat I had studied was national history, not Donghak specifically.\nBut that hardly mattered. The differences actually helped. I could understand by noting that 'this part differs from Donghak' and making comparisons.\nAnd for those parts unrelated to Donghak, I found other analogies and reference points to build understanding.\nAfter finishing my morning studies, I had lunch and then began martial arts training according to the schedule.\n\"We'll start with the lower body, Young Master. It's a common saying, but the lower body is the foundation of all martial arts. It's common precisely because it's so vital. This is an undeniable truth.\"\nJin Hayeon said so with an impassive face and demonstrated the horse stance first.\nWhile I might have excelled in academics, she was undoubtedly the expert when it came to physical training and martial arts.\nSo, I happily started copying her.\n‘It's easier than I thought?’ Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs novel{f}ire.net\nI used to hit the gym every now and then back in the modern world, telling myself it was for my health. Not that I was consistent, thanks to the exhaustion from late nights at work and waging war against impossible clients.\nIn any case, I felt no particular discomfort in holding the horse stance.\nThere was no awkwardness in maintaining balance while squatting still, nor did my knees ache or muscles strain.\nAs I comfortably held the horse stance, Jin Hayeon, who had been observing me, suddenly picked up a sandbag and placed it on my shoulders.\n‘Hmm?’\nWith the sandbag added, it became a bit more challenging but still manageable.\nThe external art training continued.\n\"Please stand up, Young Master. From now on, I will count to ten while you maintain the horse stance, and then you will stand up and rest briefly. We will repeat this.\"\nWe repeated actions similar to squats.\n\"Now, please circle the estate grounds once. I'll demonstrate first.\"\nWe also performed movements like the duck walk, a punishment from my school days.\n'This is basically a lunge, isn't it?'\nAs I continued to train my lower body with the sandbag, I didn't realize that much time had passed.\n\"Huff... Huff...\"\nAt first, I thought it was nothing, but as the repetitions increased and the number of sandbags grew, my breathing gradually became ragged.\nObserving me, Jin Hayeon suddenly asked, \"Have you truly never practiced martial arts before?\"\n“Nope.”\n\"Now I understand why the Heavenly Demon chose you, Young Master. I noticed it last night while attending to your bath, but you possess a truly remarkable physique.\"\nSo she was checking me out while I was in the bath last night.\nA cold sweat ran down my spine as she continued,\n“At least concerning the external arts, it seems there will be no major issue with you entering the Hall of the Demonic Way in a year’s time.”\nI unconsciously sighed in relief at her words.\nIt felt as if my life had been extended.\nAfter that, she showed me a bunch of other physical training methods and…\n\"It's hard to believe you've never trained in external martial arts.\"\n...her praises poured forth each time.\n\"Yours is a body truly bestowed by the heavens, Young Master.\"\nBut for some reason...\n\"As expected, the Heavenly Demon had a plan all along.\"\n...the more she praised...\n\"It seems the Heavenly Demon anticipated that you would be fully capable of entering the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\n...the less I could tell whether she was complimenting my body or praising the Heavenly Demon who had found me.\n\"The Heavenly Demon has sought you out, Young Master, rescuing you from squandering your talent.\"\nYeah, it was definitely the latter.\n'So that's why someone who looks like a robot was suddenly laying the compliments on so thick…'\nAfter two hours of intense physical training finally wrapped up, I simply rinsed the sweat from my face with water and dug into the snacks Jin Hayeon had brought.\n'Hmm. Though they may not know the concept of protein, they're basically a military organization, so it makes sense.'\nSurprisingly, the snacks provided weren't sweets but fruits and meat.\nThey must have figured out through trial and error that eating meat after a workout helps.\nAfter consuming this rather heavy snack, I opened the notes I had organized in the morning and began to review.\nThere was still about an hour left until Master arrived.\nI wondered if it would be better to combine the external art training time with my Master's lesson and extend the morning study time by an hour, but I thought that four hours of continuous exercise without rest might be too strenuous.\nOn the other hand, if I tried to get the workout done first thing in the morning and then study until my lesson with Master...\n‘I'd be too exhausted to concentrate on the lesson.’\nTrying to study when you're exhausted is always a waste of time.\nThat’s why, instead of studying new material while exhausted from the workout, I chose to use this time for review.\n‘Once I've adapted to the external and internal arts training to some extent, I should adjust the schedule a bit then.’\nSo for a little while, I let my body chill while my brain was busy rehashing everything I'd learned that morning.\n\"I greet the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons.\"\nAt her voice, I rose and opened the door to see Master standing in the garden with a relaxed expression and Jin Hayeon prostrating herself on the ground, showing utmost respect.\n\"I greet Master.\"\nI hurriedly bowed to Master, following her example.\n\"Hahaha. That's enough. I hope this old man didn't interrupt anything important.”\n\"Not at all, Heavenly Demon. The Young Master's intellect is exceptional; he has grasped all of today's objectives.\"\n\"Oh?\"\nMaster expressed interest in her words, which she gave while maintaining her prostrated position with her forehead on the ground.\n“Hahaha. I had my hopes when I brought him here, but it looks like his intellect is truly remarkable.\"\nWith a pleased laugh, Master instructed Jin Hayeon and me to rise.\nTaking the hint, I stood up, and Master spoke to me.\n“If you’re a quick study with books, you should be a quick study with martial arts. I’m really looking forward to today’s training! Hahaha.”\nIt was a moment filled with a strange sense of anticipation.\nEver since I realized that this was a world where the jianghu truly existed, I had vowed never to set foot in it.\nIf you think about it, it was the kind of dangerous world where you could die ten times and it still wouldn't be enough.\nBut at the same time, I also longed to experience martial arts.\nShooting energy blasts, cleaving rocks with a sword, running on water...\nThe possibility of physically realizing feats impossible in the modern world naturally sparked my curiosity. It was just that my life took precedence over curiosity.\nBut since I was stuck with it now anyway, I found myself actually getting into the idea.\nMaybe he saw the sparkle in my eyes, Master spoke with a hearty laugh.\n\"Hahaha. Before teaching you martial arts, there's something I must tell you.\"\n\"This disciple will listen attentively.\"\n\"Then let me ask. Il-mok, do you know what the unbelievers of the Central Plains call our Heavenly Demon Divine Cult’s martial arts?\"\nAfter pondering this unexpected question briefly, I answered with a guess.\n\"Don't they call it Demonic Arts (魔功)?\"\n\"Correct. Then, do you know why they call our martial arts Demonic Arts?\"\n\"Well, I think it's just a derogatory term the unbelievers use to slander us.\"\n\"Hahaha.\"\nI had made a reasonable deduction, but Master burst out laughing and shook his head.\n\"That's half correct. Trying to give us a bad name is definitely part of it, but there’s a much bigger reason they call it Demonic Arts.”\n\"What is it?\"\n“It’s because of the extremely high risk of Qi Deviation. People call it Demonic Arts because you get powerful fast, but it comes with some seriously dangerous side effects.”\nWhen he finished, Master looked at me with a seemingly peaceful expression. Jin Hayeon, standing beside me, also wore her usual expressionless face.\nApparently, I was the only one freaking out.\n\"M-Master? Does that mean the Demonic Arts I'm about to learn have dangerous side effects?\"\n\"Indeed.\"\nMaster nodded, his face still peaceful, and Jin Hayeon remained impassive.\nUnable to hide my bewilderment, I asked them, \"W-Why must I learn such dangerous martial arts?\"\n\"Hahaha. That's a very fundamental question I haven't heard in a long time.\"\n\"My deepest apologies, Lord of Ten Thousand Demons. It is because this lowly one has not yet sufficiently educated the Young Master.\"\nAs soon as Master finished speaking, Jin Hayeon suddenly prostrated herself, banging her head on the ground in apology.\nBut just as she was about to, an intense wave of energy shot out from Master and stopped her dead in her tracks.\n\"I do not blame you, so think nothing of it.\"\nMaster, who had momentarily exuded a terrifying aura, helped Jin Hayeon up and looked at me with a gentle demeanor.\n‘How am I supposed to survive here?’\nWhat does it matter if he’s acting nice now?\nOne wrong word and my attendant tries to smash her skull open on the floor, and he stops her by flooding the room with a terrifying aura.\nAs I unconsciously swallowed hard from the tension, Master asked me, \"Have you heard about how our Heavenly Demon Divine Cult came to be?\"\nMaster's question sent me scrambling to recall the notes I'd just reviewed.\nThe unnerving feeling that a wrong answer could have disastrous consequences kept my mind surprisingly sharp despite my exhaustion.\n“To save the masses from corrupt officials and other villains,\" I responded.\n\"Hahaha. You know well. Now think about it. If people are suffering right now , how can anyone justify taking their sweet time learning martial arts? Isn’t the only right thing to do to get strong as fast as possible, even if you have to risk the side effects?”\n\"...\"\n\"That is why those self-proclaimed righteous are nothing but hypocrites. They talk about protecting the people, but then they practice arts that take decades to master. They are merely cowards prioritizing their own safety.\"\nListening to this made my head spin.\n'Why does this sound so convincing?'\nI was so shocked by my own thought that I quickly shook my head to snap out of it.\nIt seemed the intensive review had deepened my indoctrination.\nBut there was no time to ponder as Master continued his questioning.\n\"Do you remember when this old man first tested you?\"\n\"I remember.\"\nIt would be strange to forget an experience that nearly killed me.\n\"At that time, this old man tested your character. The reason lies here. Since you will learn martial arts with side effects, only those with righteous hearts can overcome those side effects and achieve rapid progress.\"\n\"Ah...\"\n'Me, having a righteous heart?'\nAh, I'm fucked.",

    "content": "Chapter 7: Demonic Arts (2)\nAt this point, it wasn’t like I could suddenly confess, \"Actually, I'm a bad person!\"\nClinging to my last hope, I asked my Master, \"Then can I know what martial arts are available and their respective side effects?\"\n\"That's a good question. I was just about to explain that. First, there's the Raging Demon Sword Arts (爆裂魔羅劍法). When mastered, its destructive power can even demolish mountain peaks.\"\n\"What is the side effect?\"\n\"The higher your mastery, the more yang energy builds up in your body. Often, you'll lose your rationality to uncontrollable rage.\"\nI nodded at my Master's words.\n'So it causes intermittent explosive disorder.'\nIt was likely to be a real intermittent explosive disorder, not the selective kind we often encounter in our daily lives.\n'This is definitely something I shouldn't learn.'\nUnlike selective anger, genuine rage is indiscriminate.\nYou'd ignore stronger opponents and dangerous, trap-like situations, charging in blindly and practically courting death.\n\"What other martial arts are there?\"\n\"Hmm. How about the White Hand Demonic Art (素手魔功)? When mastered, it's a formidable ice art capable of instantly freezing an entire area.\" Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on novelꞁire.net\n\"And its side effect?\"\n\"Unfortunately, if a man were to learn this art, he must accumulate yin energy by maintaining his virginity. Moreover, as the yin energy builds up, sexual desire grows progressively stronger.”\n\"What happens if one can't overcome that desire...?\"\n\"If you succumb even once, you'll become a sex demon, relentlessly ravishing women until all your yang energy is depleted. And then, you die from exhaustion.\"\n\"...\"\nWhile I was speechless, Master kindly continued explaining other arts.\n\"Come to think of it, this art might suit you. It's called the Mad Soul Sword Art (狂魂劍法). Its unpredictable movements surpass even the Central Plains' Twenty-Four Plum Blossom Sword Art.\"\n\"...What is the side effect?\"\nWith no expectation left, I watched Master calmly stroke his beard and replied, \"It's said that as one's skill deepens, one begins to experience auditory and visual hallucinations.\"\n\"...\"\nThis time, it was schizophrenia.\nAfter that, various other Demonic Arts were introduced: Thunder Emperor Demonic Fist (雷黃魔拳), Demonic Wind Shura Blade Art (風魔修羅刀法), Demonic Spirit Legs (魔靈脚), and more.\nAnd the accompanying aftereffects were equally diverse: depression, mania, anorexia, multiple personality disorder, and so on.\n'I have to choose from these options?'\nIt was unclear whether I was choosing a martial art or a mental illness.\nAmidst this, a question arose.\n\"Master, I have a question.\"\n\"Speak.\"\n\"Have you mastered all these Demonic Arts yourself?\"\nOver ten arts had been listed. If he mastered them all, my Master should be suffering from more than ten mental illnesses. He was basically a walking psych ward. Given his insane power level, he was less a person and more a time bomb.\nCatching my implied concern, Master stroked his beard and laughed.\n\"Hahaha. Don't worry. The arts this old man has mastered are the Heavenly Demon Divine Art (天魔神功) and the Blood Shadow Eighteen Swords (血影十八劍). The others were learned after mastering the Heavenly Demon Divine Art solely to teach others.\"\n\"Do the side effects of other Demonic Arts disappear if one masters the Heavenly Demon Divine Art?\"\n\"The Heavenly Demon Divine Art is the most difficult and dangerous of all Demonic Arts. Once you master it and achieve Transcendence (脫魔), you can overcome the side effects of any Demonic Arts. However, it's exclusively for the cult leader. You cannot learn it unless you become the leader.\"\n\"Then, did you master the Blood Shadow Eighteen Swords before mastering the Heavenly Demon Divine Art?\"\n\"Indeed. However, I cannot pass down the Blood Shadow Eighteen Swords to you either.\"\nSeeing my puzzled expression, Master elaborated, \"It's a secret art of the Hyeokryeon Sword Family, my family. Even though I've become the Heavenly Demon, I could not arbitrarily teach a family art meant only for direct descendants to an outsider.\"\nUltimately, the two arts my Master had most deeply mastered were unavailable to me.\nI felt a slight disappointment, but there was a more important issue, so I asked another question.\n\"But must one master the Heavenly Demon Divine Art to overcome the side effects of Demonic Arts?\"\nIf you don't become the Heavenly Demon, you live with a mental illness forever. What could be more terrifying than that?\nFortunately, my Master shook his head.\n“Broadly speaking, there are three stages of mastery in Demonic Arts. The first stage, known as Tainted (入魔), is the state when one begins learning Demonic Arts. Then came the second one, Extremity (極魔). In that state, the side effects of the arts reached their peak. Finally, when one is able to overcome the demonic influence and break free from it, they achieve Transcendence (脫魔). Starting from the first stage, the side effects worsen as your mastery increases. However, like all things in the world, what fills must empty. After reaching the stage of Extremity, you will become freer from the side effect of the Demonic Art as your mastery becomes increasingly perfect.”\nMy master spoke as if overcoming the side effects was easy, but I wasn't easily fooled.\nWith years of experience in dealing with people, how could such wordplay deceive me?\n“What happens if you get stuck at the Extremity stage? If you can’t level up and just get consumed by the side effects?”\nThe transition from Extremity to Transcendence wasn't achieved through mere breathing exercises. There was a clear stipulation to that: \"When one reaches a higher state of mastery.\"\nIn other words, you had to somehow find enlightenment and level up while you were at peak insanity.\nEasier said than done. It was obvious that most people who got that far probably just got stuck there and went permanently insane.\nBut to my question, Master merely stroked his beard and uttered nonsense.\n\"Hahaha. That's why I chose you, with your exceptional talent and upright character. You will undoubtedly achieve Transcendence.\"\n\"...\"\nI must have been giving him a look of pure disbelief at his completely irresponsible answer, because Master actually seemed a little embarrassed and quickly changed the subject.\n\"Ahem. I've explained enough. Choose. Which Demonic Art will you learn?\"\nIt sounded more like \"shut up and choose.\"\nAnd sadly, rejection wasn't an option.\nSo, which mental illness should I choose?\nAfter pondering briefly, I carefully opened my mouth.\nWhile listening to Master's explanation, I had realized several things.\nThe most peculiar aspect was the concept of mastery in Demonic Arts.\n'It doesn't seem to refer to the usual stages of cultivation.'\nIt wasn't a concept where reaching the Extremity meant freely controlling Force Qi, or achieving Transcendence meant reaching a level similar to the Profound Realm of orthodox sects.\nTainted, Extremity, and Transcendence referred solely to the mastery level of the specific Demonic Art being practiced, similar to how Mount Hua’s Twenty-Four Plum Blossom Sword Technique had stages like Three Stars, Seven Stars, Ten Stars, and Grand Completion.\nUltimately, it meant one could become stronger by mastering a more potent Demonic Art and achieving Transcendence. The problem was that the more powerful the art, the more severe its side effect, making Transcendence harder.\nAnd judging by how my Master mastered the Blood Shadow Eighteen Swords before the Heavenly Demon Divine Art, it seemed possible to master a weaker art, achieve Transcendence, and then move on to a stronger one.\nThus, I carefully asked, \"Among the Demonic Arts you mentioned, could you identify the more difficult and powerful ones and the easier but weaker ones?\"\nStroking his beard, my master replied, \"The power and difficulty of the arts I mentioned are similar. Excluding the Heavenly Demon Divine Art, they are all among the best in our sect.\"\n\"...\"\nAre you kidding me? Why do I have to start on Nightmare mode?!\nThat outcry echoed in my mind, but I calmed myself and asked again, \"Since I'm starting Demonic Arts at a late age, wouldn't it be better to begin with something safer?\"\n\"Why waste time? If you have the talent to learn superior Demonic Arts, learning lower-level ones would be nothing but a waste of time. You are certainly capable of mastering them, so trust this old man and make your choice.\"\nDamn. It's a checkmate.\nPressing for easier arts would imply distrusting my Master.\nAs if confirming my fear, my Master's and Jin Hayeon's gazes grew colder.\nCornered by my own words, my mind raced.\nSurvival and a peaceful life were paramount.\nNaturally, the first art that came to mind was the White Hand Demonic Art, dubbed the Virgin Boy Art.\nThere were quite a few negative preconceptions about the Virgin Boy Art, but in my opinion, it wasn't a bad martial art.\nThat is, if the Virgin Boy Art also had the effect of reducing sexual desire.\nYou wouldn’t have to try to look good for the opposite sex, nor would you have to give up anything for romance or marriage. If that’s the case, there was no better martial art than the Virgin Boy Art for a peaceful life.\nUnfortunately, the White Hand Demonic Art’s side effect was the opposite, requiring celibacy yet increasing desire—torture, essentially.\nThe other options were equally undesirable: rage issues, schizophrenia, depression, and mania—all recipes for a shortened lifespan in the dangerous world of martial arts.\nAfter careful consideration, I made my choice.\n\"Master, I wish to learn the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword (奪魂無情劍).\"\nThe heartless sword that steals souls.\nJudging by the name alone, you’d think the side effect was that you’d turn into an emotionless psychopath, but this one's quirk was different.\n\"The Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword. As I explained, its side effect is obsessive-compulsive disorder, an inability to overlook even trivial matters. Are you certain you wish to learn it?\"\nThe side effect: obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.\nA condition where you can’t stand to cut corners, and where any tiny little flaw causes you extreme stress until you’ve made it absolutely perfect.\nAnd society often referred to those who suffered from these symptoms as ‘perfectionists.’\n'As a martial artist, this art seems to offer the highest survival rate.'\nYou're forced to always calculate every risk and make everything perfect. Compared to the other arts, I felt like the survival rate on this one would be through the roof.\n\"Yes, I will learn the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\"\nAs I gave my firm answer, Master stroked his beard while looking at me with a peculiar expression.\n\"Well then, today we'll start by learning the forms of several basic movements of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, followed by the internal energy circulation method. Once you've mastered the forms and accumulated sufficient internal energy, we'll learn how to incorporate that energy into the movements.\"\n\"Understood.\"\n\"Then, I shall fetch a sword, Heavenly Demon.\"\n\"Hahaha. This old man has his own sword; just bring one for Il-mok to use.\"\n\"As you command.\"\nJin Hayeon bowed deeply and left before returning shortly with a sword.\nShe handed it to me, and it felt heavier than I thought it would.\nShing!\nAs I grasped the sword hilt with my left hand and drew the sword from the sheath, I involuntarily froze.\n‘Holy fuck.'\nThe blade that emerged was obviously honed to a terrifying sharpness.\n\"A-are we starting with a real sword from the beginning?\"\nBoth of them just looked at me like I’d said the stupidest thing they’d ever heard.\n\"You are learning an art used to kill others, what else would one use aside from a real sword?”\n“But… don’t people usually start with wooden ones? I’m new to this. I might accidentally cut myself or something else.”\n\"I'm aware that the orthodox hypocrites give wooden swords to their young disciples with such excuses. However, since you'll ultimately be wielding a sword to kill others, worrying about injuring yourself is also hypocrisy. If you’re ready to kill, you have to be ready to die. How can you even start to learn without that basic level of commitment?”\nIt was as if they were asking if I was also the same as those cowardly hypocrites from the orthodox sects.\n\"Hahaha. Y-you're right. I-I was confused due to rumors I heard in the Central Plains.\"\n“Hahaha. Don’t pay any attention to the garbage those unbelievers talk.”\n\"I shall do as you say.\"\nI had a foreboding feeling that something terrible would happen if I didn’t.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 8",
    "content": "Chapter 8: Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword\n“Alright, let’s begin with the first form of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword. Il-mok, what do you think is the most important move for any swordsman?”\n“A devastating killing move that can end an opponent in a single strike?\"\nMaster shook his head at my answer.\n“For a swordsman, nothing is more important than drawing the sword itself. If you get ambushed or a fight breaks out of nowhere, what happens if you can’t even get your sword out? You die a pointless death.”\n\"Now that you mention it, that does seem to be the case.\"\nIn the martial arts novels and webtoons I'd read, the characters are usually already wielding their swords or weapons by the time a fight breaks out. But if you think about it, in real combat, opponents would frequently try to prevent you from drawing your sword. After all, real enemies rarely wait patiently while you prepare your ultimate technique.\n“Mastering unarmed combat techniques like fist arts, palm techniques, and grappling are basic requirements for a swordsman in case you cannot draw your sword. Moreover, depending on the distance between you and your enemies, using unarmed combat techniques or grappling might be more effective than using your sword. But remember this, if your mastery of fist and palm techniques is greater, you’d be a failure as a swordsman.\"\n\"Your words are truly wise, Master.\"\nUsing my well-honed skills of flattery developed through years of corporate life, I provided an appropriate amount of boot-licking. My Master smiled slightly as he finished his explanation.\n“And that’s what makes the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword so brilliant. Its first form, the Soul-Departing Sword (脫魂備劍), is a movement directly linked to the act of drawing the sword.”\nHaving finished his explanation, Master shifted his right foot back a step, slightly bending both knees into a flexible posture, and simultaneously drawing the sword at his side and aiming it forward.\n\"Step back once while drawing your sword to face the enemy. The key to this Soul-Departing Sword is drawing your weapon while simultaneously blocking the path of your opponent's incoming attack.\"\nIt seemed to be a stance designed to block the enemy's attack while drawing the sword, and immediately after drawing, assume a flexible posture aimed at the enemy while transitioning to offense.\nBut no matter how fancy the theory was, what it actually looked like was... pretty basic.\nHe was just stepping back and pulling out his sword. That was it.\nSince Master was looking at me expectantly, I grasped the scabbard with my left hand and the sword handle with my right, attempting to mimic the movement.\nAfter trying once, I realized it wasn't as easy as it looked.\nThe most awkward part was the act of drawing the sword itself.\nSince the length of the blade was about three feet, it inevitably scraped against the scabbard during the drawing process. Because of this, instead of being drawn smoothly like Master's, mine came out with a jerking motion.\nSeeing me awkwardly draw the sword, Master smiled gently.\n“Now do you see why the draw is so important? If you pull your sword out like that, you’ll be dead before the fight even starts.”\nI don't know why he's cursing me with a smile.\nDespite his harsh words, Master provided kind instruction.\n“When drawing the sword, it’s not just the hand holding the sword that's important. Depending on the angle at which the sword is drawn, you must also adjust the angle of the scabbard with the hand holding it. Furthermore, you need to coordinate your shoulders and body with these movements.\"\nHe didn't just explain verbally, but physically adjusted my posture with his hands.\nAfter practicing drawing the sword several times under Master's guidance, I gradually got the hang of it.\nSwoosh!\nWhen I finally managed to draw the sword cleanly without jerking and assumed the proper stance, Master nodded with satisfaction.\n\"You've taken your first step. Now, let's add some variations. An enemy's attacks won't always come from the same direction. You must be able to defend while drawing your sword in various situations.\"\nSaying so, Master demonstrated several variations. Though it was the same basic act of drawing the sword, the path of the blade during each draw was different.\nSometimes he would draw the sword to block an attack aimed at his head, and sometimes he would block an attack aimed at his legs.\nThen he did one where he spun to the right while stepping back, drawing the sword to block an attack to his side.\n“Now, this old man will slowly swing his sword at you, so try to block it while drawing your sword.”\nAs soon as he finished speaking, Master slowly extended his sword towards me.\nA chilling aura emanated from the sword as it flew towards me. Even though its speed was slow, it was a sight that sent shivers down my spine.\nClang!\nPerhaps because of its slow speed, I managed to draw my sword and block it.\nAnd as I sheathed my sword again, Master thrust his sword at a different angle.\nSwoosh!\nClang!\nIt was a strange sensation.\nI hadn't practiced blocking from these angles at all, but I was somehow doing it naturally.\nSwoosh!\nClang!\nMaybe it was because I'd grasped the core concept, whenever I thought, 'I should move like this,' my body moved naturally according to that thought and blocked the strike.\n\"Hahaha. Indeed, this old man's eyes weren’t wrong after all.\"\nMaster laughed, seemingly pleased with my aptitude.\n\"Now then, let's raise the difficulty.\"\nShhhwing!\nHe abruptly increased the speed of his sword strike.\n'Fuck!’\nEven though I almost screamed involuntarily, my body moved on its own.\nSwoosh!\nClang!\nSwoosh!\nClang!\nAfter successfully blocking a couple of times, my startled heart calmed down. Then, noticing that my eyes had become composed, Master increased the speed once more.\n'Whew.'\nHowever, this time I wasn't as surprised as before.\nSwoosh!\nClang!\nWe did that over and over again for dozens of reps with him getting a little faster each time and attacking from all different angles.\nShhhweeeeng!\nSwoosh!\nClang!\n“Hahaha! I’d say that’s enough. You’ve got the basics of the Soul-Departing Sword down perfectly.” Read complete versıon only at novel✶fire.net\nMaster smiled with satisfaction and stepped back.\n“Whew.”\nAs soon as he stepped back, all the tension drained out of me, and I couldn't help but let out a long sigh.\nDrip.\nThe sound of sweat dropping from my head onto the floor penetrates my ears.\nAt some point, sweat had been pouring down like a waterfall. I hadn’t noticed it at all while I was in a state of extreme focus.\nI stared at my sword-wielding hand with half-dazed eyes.\n'Is this really my body?'\nThe attacks Master unleashed before sheathing his sword were truly at a speed difficult to follow with my eyes.\nTo be precise, it was a speed that the eyes of Seo Ji-hoon wouldn't have been able to follow.\nBut these young eyes clearly saw Master's sword trajectory. Of course, considering the uncanny movements he displayed at the inn, he must have been going easy on me, but it was certainly an incredible speed.\nNevertheless, these eyes had accurately perceived that trajectory, and the moment I thought I had to block it, my body moved naturally without the slightest hesitation.\n'What is this cheat-like talent?'\nIf this kid had been born back in my time, he could've probably won a gold medal in Olympic fencing.\nThough here, I was just a disciple of a cult leader.\nHow much time passed as I repeatedly practiced the Soul-Departing Sword?\nMaster's voice pierced my sweat-drenched ears.\n“Hmm. Look at the time. We don’t have much time left, so let me teach you the internal energy circulation method for the remaining time.\"\nMaster approached me, instructed me to sit cross-legged, and adjusted my posture.\n“While the martial arts practiced by the hypocrites of the Central Plains are divided into internal energy cultivation, sword arts, footwork, and so on, and take a long time to master, the martial arts of our Divine Cult are mostly integrated into one. It's thanks to the predecessors who paved the way beforehand, so that we may become stronger in a short period and punish the wicked. Hahaha.”\nMaster spoke with pride, but after filtering it through my own logic, I grasped the true meaning.\nThe orthodox sects' martial arts have no side effects and utilize the proper internal energy, so they can use various different techniques, but Demonic Arts are dangerous even if you only learn one, so they integrated similar ones together.\nSword techniques, internal energy circulation, footwork, movement techniques, and unarmed combat or grappling to support swordsmanship.\nIf I were to learn at least five or six different Demonic Arts in the same way as the orthodox sects, it would mean acquiring five or six different mental illnesses.\n'...You know, maybe the old-school Demonic Cult is actually that crazy.'\nI could say that the grace of the predecessors Master spoke of was truly great. If it weren't for them, I would have had to choose from five or six mental illnesses.\nAs that realization dawned on me, I breathed a sigh of relief inwardly.\n“Now, I will show you the meridians through which internal energy flows according to the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's cultivation method.\"\nHe started poking me in various spots with his finger as he explained.\n\"First, you should memorize the meridians and acupoints I am teaching you now. You can learn the rest of the human body's meridians and acupoints from Hayeon later.\"\nAs soon as Master finished speaking, Jin Hayeon bowed her head.\nAnd after finishing his explanation, Master suddenly placed his palm on my back.\n\"Concentrate. Usually, it's important to circulate internal energy yourself to become familiar with it. However, since you started late, this old man will give you a little boost.”\nAs soon as he finished speaking, something began to enter me through Master's hand touching my back.\nIt was truly an extraordinary sensation—one I had never experienced before in my life.\nThat energy which had entered my body settled down in the center of my body and stopped moving.\n\"This is your dantian. Now, try to inhale deeply through your nose. Imagine pulling the air into the deepest parts of your lungs.\"\nMaster spoke casually even while channeling internal energy into my dantian.\nI did as he said and took a deep breath, and Master’s energy that was sitting in my dantian started to move.\nIt drifted toward the air I’d just breathed in, extracted something, and returned to the dantian together.\nThen, starting from the dantian, it began circulating through my body together.\n“This is the Qihai Acupoint.”\nEach time my Master's internal energy and the energy I had inhaled reached specific points, Master would name them.\nFeeling the Qi directly touching me like this allowed me to grasp the exact location much more accurately than when he pointed it out with his finger.\nI’m not sure how long I sat there, totally focused on his voice and the flow of energy.\nAfter repeating deep breaths dozens of times and successfully memorizing the flow of Qi and all the acupuncture points...\nMaster's energy, which had been residing in my dantian, returned to his hand, and he withdrew the hand he had placed on my back.\nBut now that I was used to 'Qi' and having successfully memorized the pathway of the cultivation method, I could actually manage to circulate it by myself.\n“ Inhale .”\n“ Exhale .”\nI sat there for a bit, circulating the energy all on my own.\nWhen a bean-sized amount of energy finally settled in my dantian, I calmly exhaled and opened my eyes.\nI peeked to the side and saw that the hourglass they were using as a timer had completely run out.\nMaster offered congratulations with a delighted smile.\n“Hahaha. Congratulations on officially starting your journey with the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.”\n“Thank you, Master.”\n“Hahaha. Now that you’ve achieved the Tainted stage, you must diligently cultivate until you reach Transcendence.”\n“I will do so.”\nIt was a matter of course. I had no intention of living as a madman for the rest of my life.\nMaster stroked his beard while watching my determined expression with satisfaction, then uttered something strange.\n“And on that note, your resolve in choosing the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword is truly admirable.”\n“???”\n“The Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword is a martial art that gradually breaks down the opponent by responding to their movements in any situation. Therefore, it is a martial art that demands perfection to be able to cope with any situation. You could even say the side effect was born from the art’s philosophy.”\n“Does this mean enlightenment comes faster than with other martial arts?\"\n“As I said before, you have to strive for perfection, so even with the help of the side effect, the level of achievement is not particularly faster than other Demonic Arts.”\nUp to this point, it was just slightly disappointing. It meant that even with the 'help' of the side effect, progress wouldn't be explosively fast.\nBut I had already accepted that to some extent the moment I started learning the Demonic Art, so it didn't matter.\nAt least, until what came next.\n\"However, no matter how perfectly one prepares, relying on a fixed method eventually leads to limitations. For the practitioner of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword to go beyond the Extremity and reach Transcendence, a change beyond perfection is necessary. The problem is, the side effect makes it incredibly hard to break free from the very perfection you’ve built for yourself.”\n“…….”\nSo basically, he's saying it's incredibly difficult for this art to achieve Transcendence?\n\"Yet, you chose this difficult path, which makes this old man truly proud as your Master.\"\n“…….”\nLooking at Master and Jin Hayeon, who were gazing at me with satisfaction, I thought to myself,\n'You should have told me that BEFORE teaching me, you fucking lunatics!!'\nIt was a scream I couldn't bring myself to utter.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 9",
    "content": "Chapter 9: Psychopath\nAfter teaching me the internal circulation method, Master left without looking back, saying he had other matters to attend to.\nLeft alone in the manor, I started my evening routine after having dinner prepared by Jin Hayeon.\nMy routine during the Hour of the Dog was quite flexible as it was dedicated to reinforcing areas that I lacked in the day's practice. If the morning doctrine study was insufficient, I would focus on the missed content. The same applied if the martial arts training was insufficient, I would supplement with additional training.\nToday, I decided to focus on martial arts training. Given my current progress, the combat examination seemed more pressing than the academic one, as the latter only required memorizing about five hundred pages of content.\nDeepening my mastery of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword would hasten the onset of its side effect, but…\n'For now, I need to build my skills enough to gain entrance to the Hall of the Demonic Way.'\nThe option of not learning the Demonic Art simply didn't exist.\nAfter another half-hour of sword practice, Jin Hayeon approached.\n\"Young Master, your muscles and meridians must be fatigued from today's practice. Allow me to perform an acupressure treatment before your evening bath.\"\nThe massage was similar to modern massage or pressure point therapy but enhanced with internal energy manipulation rather than just using hands. Having spent over two hours exercising today, the offer of a massage was most welcome.\nAs I lay face down on the floor, she began methodically pressing my muscles and meridians with her fingers. Her energy flowed through her fingertips into my body. The sensation was so refreshing that a sound involuntarily escaped my lips.\n“Mmm…”\nThis wasn't the typical relief one feels when entering a hot bath. It was genuinely cold. The energy flowing through her fingers carried a distinct chill. When I shivered, she briefly withdrew her hands and regulated her breathing before speaking. Apparently, she hadn't reached the level of mastery like Master where she could manipulate internal energy while speaking.\n“The martial art I practice embodies yin energy, so it might feel cold to you, Young Master. However, rapidly cooling heated muscles with this cold energy will aid in their recovery. Please bear with it for a little while.\"\nWith that, Jin Hayeon resumed her ministrations, pressing upon various points on my body. As goosebumps rose from the cold touch, a natural curiosity arose within me.\n“So, what martial art do you practice, Miss Jin?”\nAn art that uses yin energy couldn't be anything normal.\nShe retracted her hands and sighed softly before answering.\n\"It is the White Hand Demonic Art, Young Master.”\n“Is the White Hand Demonic Art something anyone can learn?”\nThe question arose spontaneously. Master had implied it was among the most formidable Demonic Arts, second only to the Heavenly Demon Divine Art.\n“Within the Divine Cult, all Demonic Arts, excluding the Heavenly Demon Divine Art, are accessible to disciples who have entered the Hall of the Demonic Way.”\n“Oh!”\nIt made sense. Such a policy was to be expected from an institution dedicated to cultivating the future leaders of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\n‘Hmm. So that’s the reason why Jin Hayeon was assigned to oversee my education.'\nIf it's a school for training the future leaders of the cult, of course they'd have access to the good stuff. Of course, the question of why a graduate of the Demonic Cult’s highest educational institution would be serving as an attendant still remained.\nBut an even greater question struck me.\n“Wait, the main side effect of the White Hand Demonic Art is…”\nMy voice trailed off involuntarily. After all, that side effect was...\nIncreased sexual desire...\n‘D-Don’t tell me. Is that why she always has a poker face on? Is she constantly fighting off insane urges?!'\nShe must have misinterpreted my reaction, because she frowned a little and spoke.\n“Unfortunately, the side effects of the White Hand Demonic Art differ between men and women, Young Master.”\n“Ahem. I-I see. So, what’s the side effect for a woman, then?”\n“When practiced by women or men with strong innate yin energy, it enhances logic over emotion, fostering a more detached and analytical mindset.”\nI tilted my head at her response.\n'That's a side effect? It sounds way too weak compared to the others.'\nSomething felt amiss.\n“There’s nothing else? That’s it?”\n“…I’ve heard it diminishes empathy and the ability to connect with others' emotions. However, as it is a martial art intended for purging unbelievers, I don't consider it a detrimental side effect.”\n“….”\nIn other words, it turns you into a psychopath.\nWhile I remained speechless, she continued.\n\"Please save your questions until after the massage is complete.\"\nSaying so, Jin Hayeon resumed the massage.\nAn aspiring psychopath was pressing various points on my body with Qi-infused fingers.\nA wave of goosebumps washed over my whole body, and I couldn't stop myself from shuddering.\nEarly the next morning.\nWhether due to the acupressure treatment from the aspiring psychopath or because his body was truly a divine blessing, Il-mok woke up refreshed without any notable muscle soreness.\nThanks to this, he was able to perform his morning meditation and begin his routine from early on.\nAs the lesson progressed…\n‘As expected.’ Thıs text ıs hosted at novel·fire·net\nWatching Il-mok earnestly listening to her explanations, Jin Hayeon silently expressed her admiration. He was indeed a diamond in the rough.\nDespite having only two days of training, his talent was evident.\nEven though this was all new to him, he grasped the teachings effortlessly and frequently asked meaningful questions in return. These weren't questions born from confusion, but rather inquiries to confirm his understanding. Coupled with the physical and martial prowess he'd displayed yesterday, his potential was undeniable.\nHowever, her admiration wasn't directed at Il-mok himself.\n'The Supreme One's eye for talent is truly impeccable.’\nAll her admiration was for the Heavenly Demon, who had been able to spot Il-mok’s potential.\nWhile she was internally reinforcing her faith, Il-mok suddenly raised his right hand.\n\"When do we begin studying the laws and historical records?\"\nJin Hayeon sighed internally at his question.\n‘While his talent is exceptional as the Lord predicted his laziness is a concern.’\nDue to their initial confrontation, Jin Hayeon had come to view Il-mok as lazy.\nThis assessment was half-correct.\n“Do not worry. With your intelligence, Young Master, you will find the laws and historical records no more challenging than these doctrines.”\nHe was simply not lazy when his life was on the line.\n\"I'm not concerned about the difficulty, but when we will begin.\"\nAt Il-mok's retort, Jin Hayeon internally noted her surprise and began explaining in detail.\n\"We'll start those after completing our first reading of the Secret Records of the Heavenly Demon. Since the Secret Records are fundamental to our faith, both the laws and historical records are deeply connected to the doctrines written within. It will be easier to understand those two after grasping the doctrine.\"\n“I see.”\nThough Il-mok nodded, seemingly satisfied with the explanation, she continued nonetheless.\n“Even after mastering the scripture, if you encounter difficulties with the laws and historical records, revisiting this scripture will prove beneficial. As I mentioned, all studies within our Heavenly Demon Divine Cult are rooted in these doctrines.\"\nHer proud expression as she gazed at the scripture piqued Il-mok’s curiosity.\n\"Then, how many times has Miss Jin read this scripture?\"\n“How could I possibly keep count? When I was studying the other books, I had reviewed this doctrine countless times. Even now, whenever I faced troubles or doubts in my heart, reading this doctrine brought me peace.\"\nYet somehow, contrary to her words about finding peace...\n\"Now I can recite every single word, every chapter, down to the last bit of the details. Even now, rather than just reciting it mentally, I still find joy in reading the actual text.\"\nThe more her praise of the scripture continued, the deeper the madness in her eyes grew.\n‘…A psychopath and a religious fanatic? What kind of cursed hybrid is this?’\nWitnessing the horrifying product of a cult and Demonic Art, Il-mok belatedly realized something crucial.\nHe stared at the scripture before him and shivered.\nThis scripture was a dangerous material. Avoiding it seemed prudent for his mental well-being.\nHowever, there was one significant problem.\n‘If I fail to memorize this, my head will roll in a year…’\nWorse still, without mastering this text, he couldn't even begin studying the other test subjects.\nIt was truly a dilemma, like falling into Zhuge Liang's trap.\nAs Il-mok frantically pondered how to overcome this situation, something suddenly flashed in his mind.\n‘That’s it! I can use that.’\nThough not perfect, he'd thought of something potentially useful. Yet a problem remained.\n‘I can’t trust this psychotic zealot…’\nAs someone devoted to the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult rather than to him as her master, this woman was both a servant and a surveillant.\nWhile contemplating how to hide 'that' from Jin Hayeon, Il-mok changed his approach.\n“Sorry to bother you, but could you bring me some ink, a brush, and a blank book? Oh, and if you can, a brush with a really fine tip, please.”\nInstead of hiding, he was going to hide in plain sight.\nThough puzzled by the sudden order, she went along with it. She was his servant after all,\n‘He possesses exceptional qualities, but I worry about his laziness.’\nShe suspected he was just making an excuse to send her away so he could take a break, but she immediately squashed the disrespectful thought.\n‘He is the one chosen by the Lord. Doubt is forbidden.’\nSuppressing her misgivings, she returned with the requested items. Il-mok opened the Secret Record of the Heavenly Demon and began transcribing into the blank book.\nInitially confused by his actions, Jin Hayeon soon understood what he was doing.\n'He's transcribing the scripture's contents.'\nIt seemed to be a form of review, a way to solidify the day's learning.\nHowever, it differed subtly from the review she had imagined.\nHe wasn't mindlessly transcribing.\nUsing a thin brush, he was amending the contents of the scripture.\nHe omitted redundant passages and emphasized key points, supplementing them with explanations she had provided during the lesson.\nUnbeknownst to her, Il-mok was creating his own personalized study material while reviewing.\nHe'd heard that defacing the scripture was forbidden, hence the need for a separate copy.\nOtherwise, he might have simply scribbled notes directly onto the original.\nThen, while examining Il-mok's writing, Jin Hayeon tilted her head and spoke.\n“Forgive me, Young Master, but could you explain the meaning of these markings?”\n“Ah, this?”\nIl-mok smiled gently.\n“It’s my personal code. Continuously writing lengthy passages can be tiresome, so I devised this shorthand to represent various concepts.”\nWhat Il-mok intended to show her...\nWas actually Hangul.",

    "content": "Chapter 10: Overtime (1)\nIl-mok couldn't write the things he knew as Seo Ji-hoon in Hanja. If discovered, Il-mok knew he couldn’t beat the allegation of being a traitor to the cult.\nThat's why Il-mok was writing these things in Hangul, so that only he could recognize them.\nJin Hayeon, who had been staring sharply as if trying to decode his writing, soon gave up her analysis and said, “Were you originally a scholar preparing for the state examinations, Young Master? This type of code seems like something an accomplished scholar would create.”\n“How could an orphan abandoned by the heavens have the means to become a scholar? The elder who took me in taught me how to read and write, saying I should do greater things when I become an adult. These codes are something I developed while learning from that elder, trying to find more efficient ways to study.\"\nIl-mok spat out the excuse he had prepared from the moment he came up with this plan. He had anticipated that using such writing might arouse suspicion, so he had this explanation ready.\nHowever, Il-mok's reason for showing her Hangul wasn't simply for taking notes.\nThat night.\nAfter finishing morning studies, learning martial arts from the Heavenly Demon, followed by the chilling massage and bath served by a certain aspiring psychopath.\n“Young Master, I have prepared candles, ink, a brush, and a blank book in your room.”\n“Thank you. You should retire for the night, Miss Jin.”\nAfter bidding Jin Hayeon goodnight, I headed to my room.\nJin Hayeon’s quarters were in another hall within the Windrock Palace, so it was no different from living next door.\n“Haa.”\nI let out a light sigh while gazing at the candlelight illuminating what should have been a dark room.\nThere is one thing I must do before I go to sleep.\nThe single most important part of my day if I want to survive here.\nThe last task written at the end of my schedule was simple.\n[9 PM – 10 PM: Review and Sleep]\nOriginally, it was intended as a review time, but its purpose had changed.\nWhile entering the Hall of the Demonic Way was important, focusing too much on studying the Secret Record of the Heavenly Demon posed the risk of turning me into a cultist.\nSeated at the candlelit desk, I picked up my brush and began writing in the blank book.\n—Day 1 of life in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nSo yeah, my new final task for the day was writing in a diary.\n—The Heavenly Demon Cult is a batshit crazy cult.\nA dialogue with myself to prevent unconsciously becoming absorbed into the cult.\n—These lunatics seriously believed that the Heavenly Demon will bring salvation to save them all. And what’s with them combining Xunzi’s theory and Matreiya’s belief? These people are truly lunatics of the highest order.\nIf the contents of this diary were discovered, my neck would probably be in danger. However, I was confident that I would not be caught.\n—And what the fuck is wrong with that maid? What? She’s going to kill me in a year? This is why cults are dangerous, Seo Ji-hoon. Get a grip. Don’t let them get to you.\nEven if Jin Hayeon searched my room and found this diary, there would be no problem.\nBecause the diary was written in Hangul.\nThis was precisely why I showed Jin Hayeon the Hangul during the morning study under the pretext of an efficient way of studying.\nEven if she saw this diary, she would have no choice but to think of it as a trace of my review.\nAfter all, my schedule explicitly stated this time was for review.\n—That old fart is also a problem. He should have explained beforehand that breaking free from the demonic influence of that art is so difficult! Fucking shit, what's the point of talking about the side effects and then telling me that only after I've already learned the Demonic Art?!\nI poured all the anger and dissatisfaction I'd felt toward those damned cultists over the past two days into my diary.\n\"Phew. Now I feel like I can live.\"\nWith my mind much lighter, I closed the diary and went to bed.\nLike a hamster on a wheel, my routine went exactly as I had written on my schedule.\nAbout eight days passed like that.\n“Hahaha. Your progress is quite faster than I expected.”\n“It is all thanks to the Master’s teachings.”\nAs usual, I was receiving teachings about the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword from Master. And that's when my Master suddenly brought up an unexpected topic.\n“Do you have any urgent matters this afternoon?”\n“No. I was planning to review today's lessons briefly and then retire to bed, as usual.\"\n“Hahaha. Forgo your review for today and come to this old man’s palace. It’s about time for you to greet your martial siblings.”\nCome to think of it, Jin Hayeon mentioned on the first day that I had senior disciples.\nIt was said that none of the Heavenly Demon's disciples had ever failed to enter the Hall of the Demonic Way as the top student.\nI'd been too busy keeping myself alive to give it much thought, but hearing Master's words brought up a question.\n‘Usually, when a new junior joins, shouldn’t the master introduce the junior to the seniors first?’\nThe world I had awakened to was a world of medieval martial arts fantasy.\nA world where the saying “A teacher for a day, a father for a life” was not a joke or the empty words of old fogeys.\nIn other words, the relationship between master and disciple was no different from that of father and his children, so if a new son was born, of course he’d introduce him to his other children right away.\n‘…Is it because it's a cult that they don't follow Confucian teachings to the letter?’\nDid my inner thoughts show on my face?\n“Hahaha. You seem curious as to why I am only now introducing you to your martial siblings.”\nMaster seemed to have read my mind when he asked this.\nHowever, I couldn’t just say ‘Yes, that’s right.’\n“Ahem. I thought that the Master must have had his reasons.”\nThe Heavenly Demon’s will is always the truth.\nOne word wrong and Jin Hayeon who was standing behind me might start dancing with her sword.\nNot to kill me, mind you, but to perform a suicide show while crying out, \"My education was lacking, Heavenly Demon!\"\n‘Come to think of it, I heard that psychopaths put themselves first and can’t understand other people’s emotions, but she’s quite unique.’\nShe put the Heavenly Demon first, not herself. It felt like she couldn’t feel any emotions except for those related to the Heavenly Demon.\nIt was as if a cult zealot and a psychopath had a child, and the child also inherited all the bizarre characteristics of her parents.\n“What a thoughtful response. There was indeed a reason. All of your martial siblings have been away from the cult on missions I assigned them. And today, they have all returned to the main base, so wouldn’t it be good to have a meal together and greet each other?”\nHonestly, I wanted to refuse.\nHow could I have time to socialize when I had to pass the entrance exam for the Hall of the Demonic Way with only a year of preparation?\nHowever, as a member of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, how could I dare refuse the Heavenly Demon’s invitation?\n“I will do so.”\nAs I bowed my head, I thought to myself.\n‘I wish I could log this as overtime.’\nI guarantee you, these company dinners count as overtime too.\nSo, right after training ended, I broke my usual routine and went straight for the massage and bath with Jin Hayeon.\nSince she couldn’t speak during the massage, I asked her a question while receiving the now-familiar bath service.\n“Do you know anything about my martial siblings?”\nThe dinner I would soon attend after the bath was a very important issue.\nMoreover, it was a \"welcome party\" for the new junior. And I was that \"new junior.\"\nAs the youngest, I needed to know something about my superiors' characteristics.\nOf course, calling myself the 'youngest' was a bit strange considering my position. Look at Jin Hayeon; she was technically my subordinate despite her capabilities.\nHowever, this situation was quite familiar to me.\n‘No matter how you look at it, a newcomer of 7th grade civil servant outranks a 9th grade old civil servant.’\nIf this were the military, I would be a newly commissioned lieutenant. The non-commissioned officers and enlisted soldiers would be my subordinates in terms of rank.\nBut you'd have to be insane to be that newbie lieutenant who tells the tough-as-nails sergeant major to drop and give him twenty. Even if you're the boss, if you're new, you have to learn to play nice with the people below you.\nAlso, this wasn’t a dinner with subordinates, but with superiors.\nOn top of that.\n‘A dinner with people who might kill me.’\nIt was just common sense, really. There are a bunch of disciples, but there’s only one position of Heavenly Demon.\nI don’t know how long Master will live, but when that time comes, competition among the martial siblings will be inevitable.\nMoreover, this place was a gathering of insane cultists.\nIt was a gathering of people who wouldn't bat an eye at taking each other's heads in the fight for the position of cult leader.\nSo, my most important task at today's dinner was simple.\n‘Show that I have absolutely no interest in the position of cult leader.’\nI had to show that I was a harmless nobody.\nSome people might say I should be sucking up to the strongest brother, hitching my wagon to his star.\nThat would be a stupid move.\nGetting on someone's good side has the advantage of rapid promotion if done well, but it also carries the risk of falling into the abyss with one misstep.\nConversely, remaining unaligned might mean slower promotion, but it also reduced the risk of catastrophic failure.\nIt's what you might call becoming an average office worker.\nOf course, being an average office worker means you are constantly fighting the anxiety of getting fired, but…\n'I don't know who will be the next cult leader, but the position of being the Heavenly Demon's disciple is not one that can be easily dismissed or expelled.'\nEspecially since Master is still healthy.\nThere might be a shift of power during the struggle for the cult leader position, but that’s a worry for a later time.\nAnd I hadn't completely ruled out aiming for the Heavenly Demon position myself, but that’s also for later.\n‘But for now, staying neutral is safer than picking sides.’\nRight now, my priority is successfully enrolling in the Hall of the Demonic Way. Focusing on anything other than that is equivalent to committing suicide.\nIn that sense, lying low by showing incompetence was not a bad strategy.\n'Time to deploy the classic 'Youngest Brother Pretends to be Weak' strategy.'\nWhile I was thinking such thoughts, Jin Hayeon, who was applying soap to my body, spoke in an indifferent tone.\n“Including Young Master Il-mok, the Heavenly Demon currently has four disciples. From the oldest to the youngest, the First Disciple – Wi Jin-hak. The Third Disciple – Seo Wan-pyeong. The Sixth Disciple – Jong-ri Chu. Lastly, the Eight Disciple – Il-mok.”\n\"If I'm the eighth, why are there only three seniors above me?\"\nAs she finished applying oil to my arms and moved to my back, she answered.\n“I heard that the Second Disciple passed away due to Qi Deviation.”\n“…….”\nMy spine shivered as I felt her cold hand moving on my back.\n“The Fourth Disciple lost his life in a battle against the orthodox sects during a mission. Later, the Heavenly Demon avenged him to appease his spirit. The Fifth Disciple also passed away due to Qi Deviation. The Seventh died in a duel in his attempt to gain enlightenment.”\n“Ahem. I, I see.”\nI hastily cut off her words..\nFour out of eight disciples were dead. A survival rate of only fifty percent. Moreover, two of the four dead died from Qi Deviation.

Then, how are the relationships between the remaining senior disciples? Do you know which one Master trusts most?\"\n“I would assume he trusts the First Disciple the most. He’s been around the longest.”\nShe gave me a few more bits of intel on my senior brothers while she finished up.\n\"Please wear this.\"\nAfter donning the clothes she gave me, we left the Windrock Palace.\nFollowing her guidance through the cult’s grounds, she eventually stopped before a massive hall.\nWhen she showed something like an identity token to the guards, they lightly bowed to me and cleared the way.\nWe walked through the huge corridor inside the hall for a while.\nShe stopped before the largest door at the corridor's end.\n“You may enter here.”\nShe bowed her head, indicating this was as far as she could go.\nGulp.\nSwallowing dryly, I put on a calm expression and opened the door.\nNow was the time for dinner—no, overtime—where my future and my life were at stake.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 11 : Overtime (2)",
    "content": "Chapter 11: Overtime (2)\nThe moment I opened the door and stepped inside, I bowed with my fists clasped.\n“The youngest disciple, Il-mok, greets his Master and senior disciples.\"\nAs I slowly raised my head, I took in the scene before me. Appetizing dishes were laid out in rather elegant bowls, and at the head of the table sat Master.\n\"Come in, come in. Everyone, greet him. This is Il-mok, the youngest disciple I've taken in my twilight years.\"\nFollowing Master's brief introduction, a middle-aged man sitting closest to Master nodded.\n\"Hahaha! Welcome, junior brother. I am Wi Jin-hak, your Eldest Brother.\"\nEldest Brother greeted me with a laugh that could be described as hearty at best, or foolish at worst. However, I couldn't let that smile fool me.\n'He's definitely the one who learned the Raging Demon Sword Art.'\nThis was information I'd gotten from Jin Hayeon. The side effect of the Raging Demon Sword Art was intermittent explosive disorder. Not the selective kind, but a genuine, all-consuming rage. He was the type who would slice my neck off the moment he snapped, regardless of whether Master was present or not.\n\"It's an honor to meet you, Eldest Brother.\"\nI tried to ignore the sweat dripping down my back and gave him the most polite greeting I could muster.\n'...Honestly, he seems more like a Martial Uncle or Grand Martial Uncle rather than a Senior Brother.'\nEldest Brother Wi Jin-hak was forty-five years old this year and considering this body was fifteen, he wasn't anywhere near an age I should be calling ‘brother’.\n'To think someone like him has the title Mad Demon (狂魔)'\nHe gave off the impression of a kind neighborhood uncle who was a bit slow, the type you'd find in every neighborhood back in the day.\nBut his title was indeed the Mad Demon.\nAbout twenty years ago, when the Eldest Brother's mastery of the Raging Demon Sword Art reached Extremity, he went berserk and was subdued multiple times by Master.\nMaster then advised him, \"If you cannot control your anger, don’t take it out on innocent people. Go find some evildoers and cleanse the world of them.\"\nThe Eldest Brother was so moved by this advice that whenever he felt himself about to go berserk, he’d leave Xinjiang and head for the Central Plains.\nHe’d then proceed to unleash all his pent-up rage on any local martial artists or crooked officials he could find. The body count from him alone supposedly broke a thousand.\nNaturally, the Murim Alliance declared Eldest Brother a public enemy of the jianghu, and his berserk, anger-fueled appearance earned him the title \"Mad Demon.\"\nAfter nearly ten years of venting his fury, Eldest Brother finally started to break free from the Extremity of the Raging Demon Sword Art.\n'...No matter how I look at it, it's a miracle he didn't die.'\nIt was remarkable in many ways that he survived after rampaging dozens of times in the Central Plains and killing over a thousand people.\nIf he had died, I guess they would have just chalked it up to another ‘side effect’ of his training.\nAnyway, the report said that he's now moving past the Extremity stage and is 'close to' achieving Transcendence.\nAnd for me, the key words there are 'close to' achieving Transcendence.\nIn other words, it meant he hadn't yet fully achieved Transcendence.\n‘Which means if I provoke him in the wrong way and he snaps, the rage disorder could pop right back out.’\nIf I let my guard down because of that foolish-looking smile, I'd be dead meat.\nAfter I finished greeting Eldest Brother in this tense atmosphere, a man sitting opposite Eldest Brother spoke in a gloomy tone.\n\"Seo Wan-pyeong.\"\nThird Brother Seo Wan-pyeong.\nIf I remember correctly, he was thirty-four years old. I bowed with clasped hands to this man who gave off a gloomy aura, looking like a worn-out middle manager.\n\"Pleased to meet you, Third Brother. I am Il-mok.\"\n\"Why are you greeting me twice? Are you treating me like I'm dead?\"\n\"......\"\nI was momentarily speechless.\n'Fuck...'\nThe martial art Seo Wan-pyeong had learned was the Shadowless Fourteen Moves. True to its name, it was a Demonic Art that boasted swift and traceless sword techniques, and its side effect was none other than paranoia.\nA condition where one interprets everything negatively.\nAnd unfortunately, Seo Wan-pyeong hadn't completely broken free from the Extremity of his Demonic Art.\n'If I hadn't greeted him, he would've thrown a fit about being ignored.'\nAs I stood there hesitating, unable to do either right or wrong.\n\"Third.\"\nA voice imbued with immense energy emerged from Master's mouth.\n\"!!!\"\nAs our Master's energy had driven away the demonic energy plaguing Third Brother's mind, he shook his head several times and then looked at me with somewhat clearer eyes.\n\"Ahem. I apologize.\"\n“Hahaha! Not at all! It was my fault for not knowing proper etiquette. Please don’t worry about it, Senior Brother.”\nThough he looked like he was sane for the moment, I was extremely careful not to provoke him.\nIf his paranoia kicked in again, he might sneak into my room one moonlit night and take my head.\nThe Shadowless Fourteen Moves specialized in assassination, after all.\nAs this spine-chilling greeting was over, a young man sitting one seat away from Master compared to the other two Senior Brothers greeted me.\n\"It's nice to meet you. I am Jong-ri Chu, the Sixth Disciple.\"\n\"Pleased to meet you, Sixth Brother. I am Il-mok.\"\nFortunately, Sixth Brother didn't react to my greeting like Third Brother had.\nInstead, he slightly furrowed his brows while looking at me, then suddenly turned his head slightly to look beside me.\nSixth Brother Jong-ri Chu alternated between looking at the empty space and me.\nThe Demonic Art he had learned was the Mad Soul Sword Art, and its side effect was none other than schizophrenia.\nAfter seemingly seeing something that wasn't there for a moment, Sixth Brother soon looked back at me with a gentle smile.\n\"Ah. My apologies, junior brother. I was just mistaken for a moment, please don't mind it.\"\nIf there was any consolation, due to his young age of twenty-four, he hadn't completely entered the Extremity stage yet.\nMeaning he was just mixing up reality and hallucinations every once in a while. He wasn't totally lost in them… yet.\n'Mental note: after I graduate, I need to stay the hell away from these guys.'\nThough they might be \"relatively\" sane now, it takes one year to enter the Hall of the Demonic Way and two years to complete all the training there.\nBy the time three years had passed, their condition would likely change, for better or worse.\nOr I might be assassinated by Third Brother in the meantime.\nShiver\nThird Brother Seo Wan-pyeong was glaring at Sixth Brother sinisterly.\nApparently, he thought Sixth Brother had interrupted his turn while he was greeting me.\nHe seemed to think this was because Sixth Brother looked down on him.\nAnd in response to Third Brother's sinister gaze, Sixth Brother looked in his direction.\n\"Hmm?\"\nMore precisely, at the empty seat beside the Third Brother.\n\"Fourth Brother. When did you get here?”\n\"......\"\nSixth Brother was greeting the Fourth Brother, who had reportedly died at the hands of orthodox sects while on a mission.\nHe suddenly shook his head several times, then soon returned to clarity.\n\"Ah. I seem to have had another hallucination. I apologize.\"\n\"Uahahahaha! It's alright, little brother. You must have missed Fourth Brother from your childhood. Huhahaha!\"\nIn response to Jong-ri Chu's apology, Eldest Brother Wi Jin-hak burst into another foolish laugh.\n'What a mess.'\nIt was a scene that made me want to sigh, but I managed to endure it with a transcendent patience.\nThe moment I sighed, I might incur the wrath of one of the three senior brothers.\nAfter all, none of them was in their right mind.\n“Ahem. Well, don't just stand there. Go on, sit down.”\nAt Master's order, I nervously walked over and sat down in the empty seat next to Third Brother.\nLuckily, Sixth Brother seemed to have his head on straight for the moment and didn't start shouting about how I’d stolen a dead guy's chair.\nAnd so the \"fun\" company dinner began, surrounded by my dear senior brothers, who were all clearly broken in the head.\n“Hahaha! It’s great to finally have a drink with you all again, Master, my brothers!”\nSurprisingly, it was Eldest Brother, not Master, who was playing host.\nHe poured drinks for Master's cup, filled all the disciples' cups, and then poured his own while leading toasts, or constantly burst into foolish laughter.\nAfter a bit of chitchat over food and drinks…\n“It’s good to be with all of you again. Come to think of it, did you all handle the tasks I assigned while I was away in the Central Plains?\"\nIt’s been a few sips and Master's words almost made me sigh.\n'Talking about work at a company dinner.'\nIndeed, a company dinner was undoubtedly overtime.\nEspecially if it was a company dinner with an old-fashioned, stubborn boomer.\n\"Hahaha! Don't worry, Master. There were no problems near Karamay where I was assigned.\"\n\"As for the area near Bachu, there were reports of bandits settling near the Tarim Basin, so this disciple took care of them and returned.\"\nHowever, the senior brothers didn't seem to have any particular complaints.\nI guess since they were all old-timers too, this was just normal for them.\nAfter listening to Master and the three senior brothers talk about work for a while, Master suddenly looked at me.\n\"Now that I think about it, we haven't explained the situation to our youngest.\"\n“Oh, don’t mind me. Please, carry on.”\n\"Hahaha! How could we do that, youngest? You too will be doing these tasks after graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\n“Jin-hak is right.”\nThanks to Eldest Brother's meddling, Master suddenly brought up work talk with me as well.\nMaster's explanation was brief. My kidnapping by Master in the Central Plains was just a coincidental event. Originally, Master had other business in the Central Plains and had to leave Xinjiang for a while.\nTherefore, Master had instructed the three senior brothers to patrol the regions under the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult’s influence in Xinjiang and check if there were any problems of civilians being harassed.\nThat's why when I returned to the headquarters with our Master, the senior disciples were still away.\nWith Master returning earlier than expected due to being tracked by the Murim Alliance and kidnapping me as a disciple, the senior brothers who had not yet finished their tasks returned a step later.\nAfter finishing this rough explanation...\nMaster looked at me with an intriguing expression and asked.\n\"What does our youngest think?\"\n\"About what, Master?\"\n\"I'm curious about your thoughts on everything you've heard so far. What do you think about how our cult takes care of civilians, or do you have any good ideas for improvement?\" Check latest chapters at NoveI-Fire.ɴet\nAs soon as Master asked that, all the laughter stopped, and every one of my brothers turned to stare at me.\nI felt like what I'd been waiting for had finally come.\nAccording to my plan, I needed to act incompetent here.\nHowever, simply answering 'I don't know anything' wouldn't be right.\nThe one who asked the question was my Master, the Heavenly Demon.\nIn other words, the standard for my incompetence had to be 'disappointing for a disciple of the Heavenly Demon.' It couldn't be below the average human level.\nThat’s why I spent the whole walk over here trying to figure out how I could appear somewhat clever while still giving an impression of being inadequate as the Heavenly Demon's disciple?\nAs a result, what I came up with was the image of enthusiastic but naive newcomers.\nI planned to give off the impression of someone who tries hard but doesn't achieve much. Not incompetent, but just a little more capable than being competent.\n‘Come to think of it, this question has a relation to the way the Divine Cult handles its affairs.’\nIt was the perfect topic for me.\nBecause I knew all too well about South Korea's most old-fashioned and blame-shifting work system.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 12 : Overtime (3)",
    "content": "Chapter 12: Overtime (3)\n\"First, we need to establish a clear reporting system and standardized report formats,\" I answered in a confident tone as if I knew everything there was to know about the world.\nWhich was hilarious, coming from a fifteen-year-old punk who hadn't even been here for two weeks.\n\"Once the reporting system and formats are established, subsequent work processes will become more efficient. For example, there will be no need for the Senior Brothers to personally visit each county to assess situations like they do now. They'll only need to review reports submitted to upper management and check for any discrepancies with the actual situation.\"\nAs I spoke, I modeled my explanation on the modern bureaucratic system of the Republic of Korea.\n\"There is a need for specialization. Assigning all tasks to a single individual in each region is inefficient. This is where the detailed reporting system and standardized formats I mentioned earlier will come into play.\"\nWith such specialization and division of work, dozens of departments would naturally emerge.\n\"Each field department can then communicate the situation through reports, and the higher-ups can process the work based on the reports they receive.\"\nAs a result, the blame-shifting work system that plagues the modern-day Korean administrative departments will emerge. Work will be delayed as reports travel from the field to the highest level, and interventions by middle managers seeking to avoid 'responsibility' will often lead to reports being lost or altered beyond recognition.\n\"Furthermore, assigning the same task to someone indefinitely increases the risk of corruption. We should rotate assignments and transfer personnel between departments and regions regularly to prevent the formation of close ties with local influential figures or those in related industries.\"\nThis was actually one of the most burdensome aspects for Korean civil servants.\nDepartment rotations under the pretext of preventing corruption.\nIn reality, these transfers were a nightmare for civil servants, primarily due to the lack of proper handover procedures.\n\"With a well-defined reporting system and standardized formats, transferring between departments or regions shouldn't disrupt workflow,\" I asserted.\nYet, after a transfer, asking the seniors for guidance always yielded the same frustrating responses:\n—Just follow the manual.\n—Everything's in the format guidelines.\n—I'm busy adapting to my new position. Why do you keep contacting me? Figure it out yourself.\nSure, that's understandable. Like how I was suddenly dragged to a different department, they too were forcibly moved somewhere else.\nBut still...\n'Couldn't you at least leave behind your previous reports or files? I could learn from them...'\n—Why would I leave those behind? They're my work. Of course, I transferred them to a USB and deleted everything.\n'...'\nYou could at least leave some traces of your work behind.\n'YOU SONS OF BITCHES!!'\nThe memory of my own civil service days nearly triggered an outburst.\nThanks to those damned fuckers, I had endured countless nights of overtime, poring over manuals and format guidelines to adapt to new tasks. A life a billion light-years away from the work-life balance I had dreamed of.\nThe reality of the civil service was a far cry from its lofty ideals.\nThe pathological emphasis on responsibility and adherence to rigid manuals and report formats might expedite routine tasks, but it creates endless delays in handling exceptions or public complaints.\nAnd the idea that corruption could be detected by simply comparing reports with field conditions?\nAs if anyone who has spent a few years in the field wouldn't know how to manipulate things to their advantage and get their fill.\nWhile less prevalent now, corruption remained rampant, particularly in areas like real estate, architecture, and construction. Any civil servant at a team leader level or higher could easily engage in corrupt practices if they chose to.\nAnd the solution? Departmental transfers—the most maddening system for low-level civil servants.\nThe reason I confidently explained this system, which is full of empty words and problems, was simple. It was because I wanted them to notice the issues.\nNo, even if they didn't notice the issues, it would be fine as long as they realized that the system I described didn't suit the cult\nBefore my death, I remembered that the “Did Someone Hold a Knife to Your Neck” meme was trending on the internet.\nBefore my death, I had encountered a post on an online community where a company's HR representative had lamented about new hires and interns. The gist was that excessive enthusiasm from newcomers was detrimental. A novice, still clueless about the company's inner workings, attempting to revolutionize things when you don't even know how it works just makes you look like a pathetic fool.\nTrue innovation requires a thorough understanding of the system.\nAll that the senior staff really want from a new guy is for him to learn his job and figure out how things work. That's it.\nThat’s why I deliberately acted like the overzealous novice described in that post.\nA clueless newcomer, barely ten days in, presenting a fundamentally flawed system with a superficially impressive appearance.\n'They'll see me as a fool now, won't they?'\nA somewhat bright but ultimately disappointing individual who tries hard but fails to grasp the crucial aspects—just another overeager rookie you could find anywhere.\nI wanted everyone to see me that way, but...\n'What's going on?'\nFor some reason, Master was looking at me with a deeply satisfied expression.\n\"Hahaha! Master, it seems our youngest is much smarter than we thought!\"\nEldest Brother burst into his characteristic boisterous laughter.\n\"......\"\n\"......\"\nThe Third and Sixth Brothers said nothing, but one was glaring at me gloomily, and the other was looking at me with a shocked expression.\n\"He even considered the possibility of corruption among field operatives. Isn't this system aligned with our cult's doctrines, Master?\"\nAs if that weren’t enough, Eldest Brother spouted nonsense while continuing his foolish laughter.\n\"Indeed, you're right. Humans are inherently evil. However, as the Heavenly Demon, I cannot personally inspect every cult member daily. To think such a simple solution could be found in rotating departments and regions.\"\nMaster chuckled, seemingly pleased.\nI felt wronged.\nI hadn’t been thinking about their stupid doctrine at all.\n'I've been actively avoiding the damn scripture so I wouldn't get brainwashed!'\nWait, had I been brainwashed without realizing it?\n'No. It's just that these people will interpret everything through the lens of their doctrines.'\nWhether it's a cult or not, those deeply immersed in religion are all the same.\nWhatever happens, they interpret it by connecting it to their beliefs, saying, \"This too is the will of Heaven.\"\nBut that was beside the point. Why the hell were these people listening so intently to the random crap being spewed by a clueless kid who doesn’t know anything?\nThird Brother's chilling glare was particularly unsettling.\n'Well, I can kiss a good night's sleep goodbye.'\nI had a feeling he might sneak into my quarters to test out all fourteen moves of his Shadowless Sword Art on my neck.\nAs I unconsciously gulped at that chilling thought...\n\"Hahahaha. It seems our youngest is even more talented than his senior brothers. We’d better work hard so we don’t embarrass ourselves in front of him!”\nEldest Brother's tactless praise continued to pour out.\nI was sighing on the inside, realizing my plan to look stupid had somehow just made me the center of attention, when Master spoke up.\n\"As Jin-hak says, these are truly excellent ideas. However, I find it somewhat difficult to believe that you, Il-mok, an orphan and former innwaiter, could come up with such thoughts on your own.\"\nNo sooner had those words ended than the senior brothers' gazes turned to me again.\nTheir eyes seemed to ask what my true identity was.\nMy plan was to act like a moron who thought he was smart. Instead, I was coming off as a genius who was hiding something.\nMaybe it was the sudden fear of death kicking my brain into high gear, but I came up with a decent excuse.\n\"While listening to Master and senior brothers' conversation, I was thinking about how to handle work more efficiently. My brain just kept going until it landed on what felt like a ‘perfect’ solution.”\nTo my immense relief, Master's response aligned perfectly with my intended narrative.\n“Oh? You couldn’t stop thinking until you found the perfect solution? It must be the side effect of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.”\n“Oh! Now that you say it, I think that’s it!”\nI successfully played the role of a rookie overwhelmed by the side effects of Demonic Art—one who didn't even realize the cause was the Demonic Art itself.\nMy act must have worked, as Master muttered \"Indeed\" while stroking his beard.\nNaturally, the senior brothers' attention returned to Master.\nAfter appearing to organize his thoughts, Master soon burst into laughter.\n\"Hahaha! It seems I've found a worthy disciple in my later years. It hasn't even been ten days since you began learning martial arts, yet the side effect is already appearing. Not only are you intelligent, but your progress in martial arts is also remarkable.\"\nMaster's lavish praise once again drew the others' gazes toward me.\n\"...\"\nIt seemed the 'Youngest Brother Pretends to be Weak' strategy had well and truly gone down the river.\nAt this point, it was more like the ‘Youngest Brother Shows Off How Awesome He Is’ strategy.\n'Or maybe the 'Youngest Brother Shows Off and Gets Murdered by a Jealous Senior' strategy…'\nWhile I was becoming increasingly troubled by Master and the senior brothers' gazes, Master added one last remark.\n\"We've talked way too much on work matters during what should have been a gathering for brotherly bonding. We can hash out the details later. For tonight, let’s just drink and enjoy ourselves. Il-mok, I’ll call you in later to go over your ideas properly.”\nAnd just like that, future overtime was officially scheduled. Google seaʀᴄh novelFɪre.net\nUnlike a typical old-fashioned boomer, Master didn't bring up any more work-related topics after that. The only issue was that the tactless Eldest Brother kept praising me during conversations, and each time I had to face Third Brother's chilling gaze.\nBut for the next three days, for better or for worse, nothing happened.\nThere was no Third Brother visiting with a sword in the moonlit night, nor did Master summon me for overtime work yet.\nAnd during those three days, I figured out why everyone thought I was a genius.\n'I had no idea their system was that broken.'\nFrom what I could piece together from her answers, the cult's entire administrative process was basically \"make it up as you go.\"\nIn retrospect, it was hardly surprising.\nNo matter how outdated, conservative, and rigid the Korean civil service system might be, it was undoubtedly more sophisticated than the system of a medieval martial arts fantasy world.\nMoreover, this wasn't even the Imperial Court but a cult. It was a place where if the leader said 'Do it,' things were done without any systematic process, just a 'Yes, Sir.'\nNo wonder they looked at my fatally flawed proposal like a caveman seeing fire for the first time.\n'Damn it.'\nI had my excuses. The sudden dinner gathering meant I couldn't grasp all these fundamental aspects.\nBut the biggest reason was that I had overestimated Master's capabilities.\nIt wasn't blind faith in a cult leader. It was his occasional displays of authority that had misled me. I had assumed a leader of such stature would naturally preside over a reasonably organized system.\nI had underestimated the limitations of a man from a bygone era and had overlooked that no matter how great he is, an old-timer is still an old-timer.\nBut what's done is done.\nTo survive both the potential threats from senior brothers and, more importantly, the upcoming Hall of the Demonic Way examination next year, I couldn't neglect my training.\nWith the added threat of Master's impending overtime assignments, my time was even more precious.\nSo I spent the next four days worrying about when the next unwelcome visitor would arrive.\nAnd on the fourth day, that visitor finally arrived.\n\"What brings you here, Miss Seon-ah?\"\nA cute little lady who appeared to be in her early teens had arrived.",

    "content": "Chapter 13: Traditions (1)\nA small child with black hair that had a reddish sheen, like she'd had it dyed. Judging by the child's height and build, she appeared to be around eleven or twelve years old.\nWhich, when you think about it, isn't that far off from this body's fifteen years. But my actual self, Seo Ji-hoon, was thirty-four.\nWait, I've been here a year... does that make me thirty-five now?\nEither way, the mental age gap was too large for me to feel any sense of peer connection. Instead, the child felt more like an adorable niece, one from a rather affluent family.\nEven at a quick glance, you could tell the clothes she was wearing were expensive for this time period.\n'Given that Jin Hayeon referred to her as Young Lady, it's clear this isn't just any ordinary kid.'\nUpon closer inspection, both the child's hair and eyes held a slight reddish tint.\n'How fascinating.'\nMaybe because I was staring intently at the child called Seon-ah, she bashfully lowered her head and mumbled in a tiny voice. Not only did the child lower her head, but she also clutched a small doll she was holding while fidgeting with her small fingers, clearly showing signs of nervousness.\n“I-I was just… curious…”\nFinding her demeanor both pitiful and cute, I unconsciously adopted a tone used when speaking to children.\n\"What were you curious about~?\"\nIn response, Seon-ah kept her head down but raised a tiny hand and a small finger.\nAnd her finger was pointing directly at me.\n\"Me?\"\nAt my question, the child's head bobbed slightly up and down.\n\"I wonder why you were curious about me~?\"\n\"I... I heard the adults talking. They said the new... new Heavenly Demon's disciple is very smart...\"\nI got a rough idea of what had happened.\nIt looked like my Master and brothers had been talking me up all over the place after that banquet.\nAnd as that rumor spread far and wide, it apparently reached this little one.\nWhile I was pondering this issue.\nA cold voice escaped from Jin Hayeon's lips.\n“Young Master Il-mok is busy preparing for his entrance exam. Do not disturb him.\"\nAt this cold dismissal, the child's shoulders, who had been shy just from making eye contact, slumped even further.\n'I know she's got issues because of her Demonic Art, but isn't this too harsh for a child?'\nSighing deeply at Jin Hayeon's wonderful personality, I spoke up.\n\"It's fine. If she’s just watching, it won't interfere with my studies, right?\"\n\"But...\"\nAs Jin Hayeon tried to object in a cold tone, I quickly turned my gaze to look at the child called Seon-ah.\nMaybe surprised that I’d spoken up for her, she lifted her head and stared at me with these huge, rabbit-like eyes.\n'Keuk.'\nWhen the child was cowering, I felt a strong sense of pity, but the moment I met those bright, innocent eyes, I felt like I had been struck in the heart.\n'So cute!'\nHow should I put it?\nIn modern terms, it was like when a cute stray kitten decides you’re going to be its human.\nNaturally, a strange thought also crossed my mind.\n'What kind of place is this anyway?'\nIt wasn't enough that they had Jin Hayeon, who was so gorgeous she could make movie stars jealous. Now they had a little girl who was as cute as a professional child actor. I had no idea why a psycho cult was hoarding all these good-looking people.\n“Can you promise me you'll just sit over there and be super quiet?”\nThe kid looked up at me with those bunny eyes and nodded her head so hard I thought it would fall off.\nThe sight of such a cute child adorably bobbing her head up and down was quite an attack on my heart.\nWithout realizing it, the corners of my mouth curled up as I approached the child and extended my pinky finger.\n\"Let's make a promise with this uncle... ahem, big brother.\"\n\"???\"\nShe had no idea what I was doing, so I had to show her how to hook our pinkies and then 'stamp' it with our thumbs.\n“See, link your pinky like this, and then stamp it. If you break your promise, scary people will come and get you. Got it?”\n“Yeees~!”\nThe child's earlier timidity vanished, replaced by a bright exclamation. And beside me, Jin Hayeon simply let out a deep sigh with a cold expression for some reason.\nPaying her no mind, I ended the conversation so that she could no longer scold the child again.\n“She promised to be quiet, so how about we get started with my lesson now?”\nJin Hayeon looked alternately between the child and me once again before sighing deeply and responding with her usual cold face.\n\"Very well.\"\nMy daily routine proceeded as usual even though there was an additional cute observer.\nSeon-ah, true to her word, remained silent and simply watched.\nThe lesson had been a solid two hours long before Jin Hayeon announced, \"Let's take a short break.\"\n\"Haah...\"\nA sigh escaped my lips involuntarily. Even for someone accustomed to studying for exams like me, two hours of uninterrupted learning was no easy feat, especially given my circumstances.\n'So this is why 50-minute classes and 10-minute breaks became the golden rule, huh?'\nI cleared my head of these useless thoughts.\nJin Hayeon sat across from me, sipping tea to quench her thirst after talking for two hours straight.\n\"Haa.\"\nNaturally, another sigh escaped.\n'They call it a break, but there's nothing to do.'\nBack in the modern world, I could at least use my phone to entertain myself, but there was no such thing here. And even if I were to do something on my own, I'm pretty sure Jin Hayeon would stop me before I could do anything.\nAlthough she said she was assigned as a maid and tutor for me, she felt more like a warden than a servant and tutor.\n'Forget the Demonic Art. I'm gonna go crazy from sheer boredom and frustration first.'\nLost in thought, I met the gaze of the little girl who had been watching me.\n\"What were you doing~?\"\nWhen I asked with a smile, the child blushed and answered.\n“I-I was… l-listening to the lesson.”\n“Oh yeah? Did you understand everything that sister was saying?\"\n\"Yes...\"\nWhile the child’s bashful response was cute, it also made me wonder.\n‘This child is… Eleven? Twelve maybe? Twelve years old seems a bit young to understand such complex content. Oh, that’s it. Since the child seemed to be from a well-off family, she must have started her education early.’\nIt hit me then that she might be studying for the same entrance exam I was.\n\"What's your name, little one? I'm Il-mok.\"\nHearing my question, the child fidgeted with her doll with her small hands and answered.\n\"Se... Seon-ah. Hyeokryeon Seon-ah.\"\n‘Hyeokryeon...where have I heard that before?'\nAfter briefly searching my memories, I remembered something.\n'Master's name was Hyeolryeon Il-hwi, wasn't it?'\nI then remembered that my Master had said that the Blood Shadow Eighteen Swords, the martial art he had mastered before the Heavenly Demon Divine Arts, was a specialty of the Hyeokryeon Family. Connecting the dots, the Hyeokryeon Family had to be a big deal in this cult.\n'So that's why Jin Hayeon called the child young lady.'\nShe was the daughter of a prestigious family within the Demonic Cult and likely a relative of my Master, the Heavenly Demon.\n'Should I keep using honorifics then? No, I'm Master's disciple, so am I actually higher in hierarchy?'\nOur positions within the Demonic Cult seemed to be on a similar level. In that case, it probably wouldn't be a problem for me, as the elder, to speak informally.\n\"Then, what's the name of that doll you're holding, Seon-ah?\"\n\"Um, M-Mommy.\"\n\"Mommy?\"\nWhen I asked again with a puzzled expression, Seon-ah nodded.\n\"Y-yes, Mommy doesn't hate Seon-ah like my real mother does, and she doesn't leave me alone. S, so Mommy is my real mother.\"\n\"......\"\nI suddenly felt like I had walked in on a conversation I was definitely not supposed to hear.\n\"Ahem. So, Seon-ah,\" I said, forcing a smile, \"what do you usually do?\"\n\"Similar to Big Brother. I study, and practice martial arts...\"\n\"Only studying and training? You don't get to play?\"\n\"I... I just stay with Mommy.\"\nWhen she speaks of Mommy this time, she likely refers to the doll rather than her real mother.\n‘We're quite similar.'\nA sudden sense of loneliness washed over me.\nWhen I think about it, I also spend all day studying and training, with no time to socialize or relieve stress.\nThat banquet last time?\nThat was just a minefield where I had to worry about screwing up.\nJin Hayeon, who was constantly by my side, is more like an inhuman machine. She only engages in work-related conversations.\nJust as she has her doll, my only friend is my diary.\nThe diary where I poured out my frustrations about this damned cult every single day.\n\"We are the same, then.\"\nPerhaps feeling some inexplicable kinship, I felt more comfortable talking with Seon-ah.\n“Do you want to come visit often? Big Brother is happy to have someone to talk with like this.”\n\"Really?\"\n\"Of course.\"\nSeon-ah smiled brightly and asked without avoiding my gaze this time.\nAt that moment, a cold voice interrupted our conversation.\n\"Young Master. This promise may cause problems...\"\nThe second she started talking, the little girl’s happy expression just deflated.\n“Now, now, Seon-ah kept her promise, didn’t she? I too will maintain my current schedule, so don’t be such a worrywart.”\nPerhaps reassured by my firm response, the child looked up at me again.\n“So, are we going to do… that thing again?”\n“That thing?”\nWhen I asked in a puzzled tone, Seon-ah wiggled her tiny finger.\n\"Ah! The promise?\"\n\"Yes! The promise!\"\nSeeing the cute little one's bright smile, I felt some of the stress that had been building up during my confinement in the Demonic Cult dissipate a bit.\nI smiled pleasantly as I hooked fingers with the child and made the promise.\nJin Hayeon, watching this scene from the side, sighed deeply.\n'I know my exam is important, but why is she being so over-the-top about this? If she's so worried about my time, she should've tried to get me out of that stupid banquet!'\nIf the issue was the reduction in study and training time, that banquet was a far more serious problem. As if to answer my question, Jin Hayeon's voice echoed in my mind through the voice transmission technique.\n—Young Master, getting close to the Hyeokryeon Family's daughter is dangerous.\n\"???\"\nWhat the hell was that supposed to mean?\nI must have had a 'What the fuck?' look on my face, because she started to send another message. But before she could, a party crasher showed up.\nCreeak. Bang!\nWithout even the courtesy of a knock, the main door of the Windrock Palace burst open.\nI instinctively snapped my head toward the entrance.\nStanding there was a beautiful woman who seemed to be in her early thirties, her cold eyes scanning the interior of the palace. Behind her, I glimpsed the figures of several men and women.\nThe woman's eyes changed subtly when she saw Seon-ah near me, and Seon-ah's shoulders hunched when her eyes met the woman's.\n\"M-mother...\"\nOnly after hearing Seon-ah's timid voice did I notice that Seon-ah's face resembled the woman's.\nAs I realized that the woman was Seon-ah's mother, her expression turned even more vicious as she glared at me.\n“What is the meaning of this?”\nHer tone was as vicious as her expression.\nHowever, there was one more woman here who could match her viciousness.\n“What is the meaning of your rudeness, Lady Cheonghwa? This place is where Young Master Il-mok, the disciple of the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons, holds his studies.”\nJin Hayeon's cold reply made Lady Cheonghwa’s head whip around to face her.\n“You are the one who is utterly disrespectful. It doesn’t matter how esteemed he is; he’s merely the disciple of the Heavenly Demon, not the Supreme One himself. Are you suggesting that the Supreme One’s disciple is above the great Hyeokryeon Family? And how dare a mere servant talk back to me and try to borrow the Supreme One’s authority for her own gain!”\nHer viciousness rivaled that of mothers-in-law in K-dramas.\nIt looked like natural-born spite was stronger than Demonic-Art-induced emotion loss. Jin Hayeon was actually speechless.\nLady Cheonghwa continued her attack.\n“The Eighth Young Master has only recently joined the Divine Cult, so his ignorance of our customs is understandable. You, however, are failing to educate the Eighth Young Master. You shall be punished accordingly!!”\nTraditions? What traditions?\nWhile that thought came first, there was something more important. The most update n0vels are published on novel·fıre·net\n\"Who are you to barge into another's residence and create a scene?\"\nEven if Jin Hayeon was more of a warden than a servant, she was still my subordinate.\n'Really, there's a limit to how much you can disrespect people.'\nBerating my servant in front of me was no different from berating me directly. In fact, it was arguably more insulting. As I stepped between the two women, Lady Cheonghwa glared at me with venomous eyes. Had I been my old self, I might have cowered under such a gaze. In modern terms, she was the equivalent of a chaebol family's daughter-in-law.\nBut now it just made me laugh inwardly.\n'So what if you're a chaebol family's daughter-in-law? I'm the favorite disciple of a cult leader!'\nThough it wasn't something to be proud of, it carried tremendous weight within the cult.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 14 : Tradition (2)",
    "content": "Chapter 14: Tradition (2)\n\"Did you just say I'm causing trouble?\"\nAs I looked at Lady Cheonghwa’s fiery eyes, a strange feeling washed over me.\nThough her face resembled Seon-ah's, their auras were polar opposites.\n‘Truly, the eyes are the window to the soul.’\nBrushing aside these unnecessary thoughts, I addressed Lady Cheonghwa.\n\"Not only did you barge in without permission, but you also started chewing out my subordinate right in front of me. If that's not causing a scene, then what is?\"\n“You were the one who broke the cult’s traditions first!”\nBut her retort drew a sneer from my lips.\n“Then, you should have explained things to me properly and treated me with proper courtesy. You, Lady Cheonghwa, accused my servant of borrowing the authority of the Heavenly Demon for her own gain, but isn’t your current behavior the exact accusation that you directed at my servant?”\n\"......\"\nThe mention of my Master made Lady Cheonghwa, who was about to retort, glare at me while grinding her teeth.\nWhatever traditions Lady Cheonghwa spoke of, the moment she acted out against a disciple of the Heavenly Demon, the justification shifted to my side.\nShe seemed to realize it too, because she gave a stiff little bow.\n\"I apologize for my momentary lapse in judgment and any disrespect shown.\"\nBut it was only for show. Her voice might have been polite, but her eyes were still throwing daggers.\n‘Time to de-escalate.’\nNow that she had apologized, pressing her further would only shift the justification and moral high ground back to her.\n\"I accept your apology. Now, could you explain this tradition you mentioned? If I am truly at fault, I will apologize to you as well.\"\nFor some reason, Lady Cheonghwa seemed to hesitate at my words before subtly turning her head to look at Seon-ah.\n'Hm?'\nIt was a strange shift.\nIn the eyes of that woman, who had been so vicious just now, there was a momentary flicker of affection and pity.\n‘What’s this?’\nAccording to what I'd heard from Seon-ah, her mother was anything but maternal, so distant that the girl treated a doll as her mother figure.\n\"This matter is not suitable for Seon-ah's ears. May we speak privately?\"\nHer gaze turned cold again as she looked back at me.\nEventually, Lady Cheonghwa and I headed to an empty room in Windrock Palace.\nJin Hayeon brought tea and stayed with us as a precaution, while a guard accompanied Lady Cheonghwa.\n\"So, what is this tradition that cannot even be discussed with Seon-ah herself?\"\nAfter a sip of tea, Lady Cheonghwa answered.\n\"It is a long-standing tradition of the Divine Cult to forbid physical contact with the daughters of the Hyeokryeon Family.\"\nThe absurdity of the tradition rendered me speechless for a moment.\n\"May I know the reason?\"\n\"It is due to the Demonic Art that Seon-ah is cultivating.\"\n\"If it is the Hyeokryeon Family's Demonic Arts, are you referring to the Blood Shadow Eighteen Swords?\"\n\"The Blood Shadow Eighteen Swords is a martial art practiced by the sons of the Hyeokryeon Family. The daughters practice a Demonic Art called the Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art.\"\n\"What side effect of this Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art necessitates keeping a distance from such a young child?\"\n\"The side effect is simple: extreme obsession.\"\n\"......\"\nWhile I was momentarily at a loss for words, Lady Cheonghwa continued her explanation.\n“When they fixate on someone, they suffer extreme anxiety if they’re separated even for a moment. And if anything happens to the person they’ve fixated on… they often go completely insane.”\n\"So, you deliberately keep your distance to avoid becoming an object of obsession?\"\n\"That's correct. It’s easiest to form an attachment to another person. But people can’t be together forever. People get hurt, they get sick, they die. Especially in our line of work.”\nThough I understood her reasoning, I still had doubts.\n\"Even if everyone avoids her, that doesn't make the Demonic Art's side effects disappear, does it?\"\n“That’s the entire point of the isolation. We do it until they fixate on something else. After a few years of isolation, they often develop attachments to dolls, pillows, or ornaments like hairpins.\"\nAs soon as I heard Lady Cheonghwa's explanation, I thought of that doll Seon-ah carried around, the one she called ‘Mommy.'\n\"Seon-ah began practicing the Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art last year. The goal is to have her form an attachment to an object before she enters the Hall of the Demonic Way. And it is a long-standing tradition for everyone in the Divine Cult to avoid a daughter of the Hyeokryeon Family until she shows signs of obsession with something else.\"\nHaving finished her explanation, Lady Cheonghwa took a sip of tea and looked at me.\nHer eyes seemed to ask if I now understood what I had done wrong.\nHer explanation, however, felt more like an excuse born from twisted logic from this damned cult.\n'For fuck's sake. This isn't a tradition. It's child abuse.'\nHonestly, part of me had been worried during our little face-off. What if I really screwed up? What if this custom is a huge deal and I just blew it?\nNow, however, that worry was replaced by disgust.\n“…The fact that you’re telling me this without her here means Seon-ah doesn’t know about any of this, right?”\n“Telling her about the side effect would make it impossible for her to form a natural attachment to an object.”\nHer dispassionate tone made my blood boil.\nMaybe it was pity for the poor kid. Or maybe it was because, in a way, we were in the same boat.\nLike Seon-ah, I was dragged here against my will by my Master and was destined for a life plagued by mental illness. Confined within Windrock Palace, under Jin Hayeon's watchful eye, my future held only endless training and study.\nHowever.\n'At least I had a choice. A shitty one, but still a choice.'\nThat child had to live this way simply because she was born into the Hyeokryeon Family.\nMy face must have hardened at the thought, because Lady Cheonghwa mistook it for acceptance.\n\"Since Young Master seems to understand now, we shall take our leave.\"\nAs I watched the backs of Lady Cheonghwa and her guard as they opened the door to leave, my mind was a complex mess.\nI felt utterly disgusted, but what could I do when it was a long-standing tradition of this insane cult?\nLost in this turmoil, I heard Lady Cheonghwa's cold voice.\n\"Let's go.\"\nThe timid child turned, her eyes meeting mine with a desperate plea. Looking at her, I felt a surge of self-loathing for my hesitation.\n\"Wait a moment.\"\n\"Young Master?\"\nAs I suddenly stood up and approached Seon-ah, Jin Hayeon called out to me with a rare look of bewilderment.\nIgnoring her, I knelt before the child to meet her gaze.\n\"Seon-ah. Do you remember the promise we made earlier?\"\n\"Promise...? Ah!\"\nThe child tilted her head adorably and exclaimed as she remembered.\n“S-So I can come back tomorrow?”\n\"Of course. We promised, didn't we?\"\nI had said before Lady Cheonghwa barged in.\nI had invited Seon-ah to visit whenever she needed someone to talk to.\nAnd I still feel the same way now.\n\"If you diligently train and study at the family estate, you can come visit and play with me.\"\n\"Eighth Young Master!!\"\nAs soon as I finished speaking, Lady Cheonghwa's venomous shriek cut me off.\n“Are you really going to defy the sacred traditions of the Divine Cult?!”\nAnd I roared back, matching her fury.\n\"To hell with your traditions!\" Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on n͟o͟v͟e͟l͟f͟i͟r͟e͟.net\nThose damn traditions.\nThe more I heard it, the more it reminded me of those cursed traditions I experienced as a civil servant, and it made my blood boil.\nEven before I died, there had been controversial practices like the \"probationary rice cake\" and \"serve the section chief day.\" The civil service world had various traditions.\nAbsurd traditions existed because of the disgustingly conservative civil service society.\nAnd here it was again, another insane tradition tormenting a child.\n“What's the purpose of practicing Demonic Arts? To have people consumed by the side effects? No!”\nHe roared, “It is to temper your heart and overcome the side effects! Yet, not only did you people create such an insane tradition, you also impose it on the entire Cult! Does that make any sense to you?”\nLady Cheonghwa's eyes turned glacial.\n\"Can you take responsibility for your actions? You are scheduled to enter the Hall of the Demonic Way in a year. What are your plans after that if she becomes attached to you?\"\nShe was right. If Seon-ah got attached to me and I just vanished, the backlash from her training could cripple or even kill her.\nLooking at Seon-ah, an idea popped into my head.\n\"I have a plan, so do not worry. If anything goes wrong after I leave for the Hall of the Demonic Way, I’ll take full responsibility.”\nThat night.\nDeep inside the cult's headquarters, in the private office of the Heavenly Demon himself, two men were meeting alone.\nOne was the Heavenly Demon himself and the other was a man who appeared aged between forty to fifty.\nHaving listened to the man's account, the Heavenly Demon calmly stroked his beard and looked at the man instead of immediately answering.\nDespite appearing only a decade apart in age, the older man was in fact the current head of the Hyeokryeon Family, a distant grandnephew twice removed to the Heavenly Demon.\nThe reason they appeared so close in age despite a nearly forty-year difference was that the Heavenly Demon, having reached an exceedingly high level of cultivation, had undergone two body reformations.\nHowever, that was not to say that the Hyeokryeon Family Head’s martial arts were lacking.\nThe Hyeokryeon Family head was also an ‘old man’ who had achieved Transcendence with the Blood Shadow Eighteen Swords. He had also undergone Overhaul Body Transformation, though only once, not twice like the Heavenly Demon. That’s why he had only appeared a bit younger than the Heavenly Demon.\nThe relative stability of the otherwise chaotic Demonic Cult, a place filled with individuals driven mad by the influence of Demonic Arts, was largely due to the fact that the leaders of its major families and factions were predominantly masters who had achieved Transcendence in powerful Demonic Arts.\nWith the Heavenly Demon at the helm, these seasoned masters kept the demonic cultivators in check through sheer force.\nHowever, overcoming the side effects of the Demonic Arts did not mean they were immune to things that would anger any ordinary person.\nThis was especially true when it came to disregarding the traditions of the Hyeokryeon Family.\nThe Hyeokryeon Family did not uphold this tradition just because they wanted to. It was born from painful necessity. Countless times, excessive attachment to parents or siblings had hindered cultivation and studies. There were also numerous instances of madness triggered by the death of a loved one.\nFurthermore, outsiders and servants often exploited this vulnerability to manipulate the daughters of the Hyeokryeon Family like puppets.\nGenerations of that kind of horror are what led to the current tradition.\nBoth Lady Cheonghwa, Seon-ah's mother, and the head of the family, Seon-ah's grandfather who had come to argue with the Heavenly Demon, were forcing themselves to ignore the child while enduring their bleeding hearts.\nFor the prestigious Hyeokryeon Family, the option of not teaching Demonic Arts to the child didn't exist in the first place.\nIt was their tradition.\nThe Heavenly Demon, being from the Hyeokryeon Family, knew this all too well.\nIn other words, the Head of the Hyeokryeon Family had come to see the Heavenly Demon not to ask for his wisdom.\nIt was a courtesy call, a final gesture of respect before killing his disciple.\nHowever, the words that came from the Heavenly Demon’s mouth were unexpected.\n\"Just leave it be.\"\n\"Pardon?\"\nThe Hyeokryeon Family Head deliberately swallowed the rest of his words.\nBut instead of rebuking this rudeness, the Heavenly Demon uttered more strange words.\n\"Aren't you curious? Whether that child can free the Hyeokryeon Family from its shackles?\"\nIt wasn't just because the boy was his disciple.\nHe recalled the recent banquet with his four disciples.\nAt such a young age, Il-mok had come up with a truly profound system that even he hadn't thought of.\nSo naturally, he was expectant. He wondered if that child might come up with another brilliant solution this time as well.\n\"What will you do if he fails?\"\nThe Heavenly Demon replied.\n\"Then, you may deal with my youngest as you see fit. Furthermore, I will take Seon-ah as my new youngest disciple. This old one will constantly watch over her to prevent the Demonic Art from going berserk, so rest assured.\"\nFor the first time since his arrival, astonishment painted the Hyeokryeon Family Head's face.\n\"Do you have that much faith in your youngest disciple?\"\nTo that question, the Heavenly Demon merely stroked his beard and laughed heartily without giving a particular answer.\n‘Faith, you say? Hahaha.’\nRather than faith, it was expectation.\n‘He's already preparing to make allies. How remarkable! Hahaha. And he, of all people, chose the Hyeokryeon Family.'\nIf he succeeded in this matter, the Hyeokryeon Family would show absolute support to Il-mok, even long after the current Heavenly Demon was gone and Il-mok could no longer be called the disciple of the Heavenly Demon.\nThe Heavenly Demon suspected that Il-mok had already calculated this far ahead.\n'The wheel has already started turning, so all that remains is to wait for the outcome.'\nWhether Il-mok would meet his demise at the hands of the Hyeokryeon Family or gain a powerful ally in the form of one of the Divine Cult's most influential families.\nThe Heavenly Demon was truly looking forward to that outcome.",

    "content": "Chapter 15: Tradition (3)\nLate at night, while Heavenly Demon was having a private audience with the head of the Hyeokryeon Family, Il-mok was in his room after finishing his daily routine, doing something while leaning against the lamplight.\nHowever, he wasn't writing in his diary. New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on Novᴇl_Fire(.)net\nEngrossed in his work, Il-mok furrowed his brows.\n“Someone must be talking shit about me.”\nHe grumbled irritably while picking his ear.\nThough he cleaned it thoroughly, it didn't quite clear up his unease.\n\"Haa… It's been a while, so I'm a bit rusty.” He looked down at the half-finished thing in his hands and sighed again.\n'Well, the final deadline is before entering the Hall of the Demonic Way anyway.'\nWith that thought, he pushed aside his impatience.\nAfter all, he had made one of these before.\nThe problem was that it had been quite some time ago, and he'd only done it once as Seo Ji-hoon.\nGazing at the bizarre, nearly unrecognizable object, Il-mok resolved himself.\n'Okay, let's just call this a practice run.'\nDespite the stifling aura of Lady Cheonghwa's unwelcome visit, nothing out of the ordinary occurred at Windrock Palace. As usual, I endured Jin Hayeon's relentless tutelage and diligently prepared for the entrance examination.\nIf there was one change, it would be...\n\"Big Brother~!\"\nThat little one who visits every day when I finish my martial arts training.\nSince I couldn't let her come at random times, we made a promise that she would only visit at this specific hour.\nAlso, unlike the first day, she now came with a stern-looking man who appeared to be a martial artist― perhaps a sign of tacit permission from the Hyeokryeon Family.\nDue to that cursed tradition, the bodyguard did not say a word to Seon-ah and simply waited at the entrance of Windrock Palace.\n\"Hehehe.\"\nSeon-ah also showed no interest in the guard. She would just run over and beam brightly beside me.\nDespite the pungent smell of sweat from my body after being rolled around by Jin Hayeon under the guise of martial arts training, this child approached me without minding the smell at all.\nSeeing the little one's smile makes me feel more at ease.\n'I made the right decision by pushing forward.'\nIt wasn't just for Seon-ah's sake. In this prison-like environment, conversing with a little one who shared my predicament was like sweet rain to me.\nPeople need to relieve stress to live. Without leaving at least a minimal breathing space, one is bound to go mad.\nThough in this place full of lunatics, it probably wouldn't be noticeable if I went crazy.\n'Which makes it even more dangerous.’\nSince everyone here is crazy, they might just think someone like me is fine and let it slide.\nAnyway, it was a peaceful daily routine.\n\"What were you doing at home today?\"\nI listened to the little one's daily stories as she chattered beside me.\n\"Today I learned how to apply the tenth form of Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art. Hehe. They said if I put my fingernails like this and stretch them like this, I can easily put a hole in a bad guy's heart.\"\nShe demonstrated with a little flourish, and I managed to plaster on an awkward smile.\n'What the hell are these lunatics teaching a little child?'\nAnyway, it was peaceful. By the standards of the Demonic Cult, that is.\nJust as I was enjoying this peaceful afternoon and blowing off stress.\n\"I greet the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons,\" the bodyguard's voice boomed from beyond the gates of Windrock Palace.\nIt seemed that training time with Master had arrived.\n\"Rise.\"\nMaster's voice echoed from beyond the gate. Soon, the doors opened, revealing his figure.\n\"We pay our respects to the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons.\"\nJin Hayeon and Seon-ah, along with me, promptly bowed before Master, performing the most respectful bow.\n\"Hahaha. Rise. Now that the time has come, let the child of the Hyeokryeon Family return to her home.\"\n\"I... I shall obey your command.\"\nShe got up and scurried toward the gate, but she glanced back over her shoulder one last time.\nHaving been allowed to rise, I gave the child a small wave. Seon-ah, who had been nervous since Master's appearance, brightened up and left with a smile as she waved back at me.\nMy Master who was watching from the side, suddenly brought up an odd topic.\n\"You seem to be getting along well with the Hyeokryeon Family's daughter.\"\n\"It just happened that way.\"\n\"Hahaha. It just happened that way… Very well. You must have your reasons. Do your best.\"\n\"???\"\nI couldn't comprehend what he meant by doing my best.\n'Surely, he doesn't mean that way, does he?'\nAlthough our physical ages were only three years apart, that was simply out of the question. My feelings were akin to what one feels towards a cute puppy or kitten, or the fondness one has for a young niece’s silly antics.\n'Perhaps the old man's preferences lean that way....'\nAs the saying goes, one sees what one wants to see.\nAfter briefly looking at Master with a somewhat contemptuous gaze, I quickly turned my head away when his eyes suddenly met mine. If he caught me with such an expression, my head would surely roll.\n\"Well then, let's begin our training.\"\n\"Yes, Master.\"\nThe Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword consists of twenty-two forms in total, divided into fourteen main forms and eight secret techniques.\nNearly a fortnight had passed since I began learning the sword art, and I had successfully mastered all fourteen main forms.\nAfter teaching me all fourteen, the perverted old… No, Master explained the true essence of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\n“The reason it's called the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword is because, as the name suggests, it's a sword art that snatches away the opponent's soul. The significance lies in making the opponent lose their wits through a continuous and natural flow of movements.”\n\"While it resembles the Mad Soul Sword Art in its emphasis on linking and transforming martial art moves, its essence is completely different. The Mad Soul Sword Art aims to take the opponent's head by surprise with unpredictable and bizarre movements. The Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, on the other hand, corners the opponent little by little, then takes their head when they've given up everything. That expression of utter despair, as if their soul has departed, is why it's called the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword (奪魂無情劍).”\nMaster didn't just explain the physical movements but also elucidated the underlying meaning of the entire sword art. His explanation allowed me to grasp the crucial element of the fourteen forms I had learned.\n'The lower body and waist are key. It’s about maintaining balance while performing demanding movements and steadily pressuring the opponent.’\nUpon reflection, I realized that all the movements of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword could seamlessly connect with each other regardless of their order, as long as balance was maintained.\nHaving organized my thoughts, I sheathed my sword then drew it according to the principles of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword and performed the stances I had learned so far in various ways.\nI moved slowly at first, focusing on finding the right rhythm for the unfamiliar sequences. Then, I gradually increased the speed and power in my arms and legs. Sure enough, once I got to a certain speed, I started to feel myself wobble.\n'Is this the best I can do for now?'\nAs I continued to link the movements at a speed and force that allowed me to maintain balance, Master's satisfied chuckle reached my ears.\n\"Hahaha. It seems you have grasped the core of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword with just my brief explanation. You were right, Hayeon, the boy’s intuition is top-notch.”\n\"How could that be attributed to this lowly one's discernment? It is solely thanks to the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons who found Young Master Il-mok and brought him to the Divine Cult,\" Jin Hayeon responded.\nThough I was the one rolling around swinging the sword back and forth, somehow the two of them were creating a warm atmosphere while patting each other on the back.\nI felt like a child performing in front of the elders on a holiday, so I put the sword back into its sheath and regulated my breath.\nObserving my actions, Master spoke.\n\"The latter forms can only be learned after reaching the realm where one can generate Sword Qi. For now, focus on refining the main forms.\"\nHe then approached me and placed his palm on my abdomen.\n\"Hmm. It seems you've been consistently practicing your breathing techniques.\"\nAfter gauging the amount of internal energy gathered in my dantian, Master suddenly threw a question at Jin Hayeon.\n\"How is Il-mok's doctrinal studies progressing?\"\n\"He is learning very quickly. It's hard to believe he just joined the cult. He's progressing so fast that one might think he had already studied the doctrines to some extent before.\"\nShe praised me with her signature business-like tone and a cold expression.\nWell, it would be hard for her to criticize me.\nAlthough only a fortnight had passed, I had already studied nearly thirty percent of the Secret Record of the Heavenly Demon.\n\"At this rate, he should be able to master all the scriptures, historical texts, and law books within half a year at the latest, after which just simple reviews would be sufficient.\"\n\"Hahaha. Good understanding of studies, and quick progress with the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword as well. That means he has plenty of time.\"\n\"That's how it has been so far.\"\n“Hahaha.\"\nMaster's gentle laughter turned into a pointed gaze directed at me. A sense of déjà vu washed over me.\n'This is… that , isn't it?'\nThat uniquely Korean custom of piling on more work when you finish early, instead of letting you leave on time.\nThe so-called 'filling up spare time.'\nRemembering what happened at a company dinner, I hastily opened my mouth.\n\"Ah, it's still too early, Master. I'm only able to progress quickly with the scriptures because I just started studying. As the material to study piles up, there will inevitably be less time for review.\"\nMaster had clearly said at the banquet that he would 'assign me a mission later.'\nAnd now, he was undoubtedly creating justification to give additional work.\nIn a way that was all too familiar to me.\n―Hahaha. Our Ji-hoon is such a hard worker. Since you seem to have some free time, how about you also handle this? Since it's related work, you should be able to process it quickly.\nI could still hear my old boss’s voice in my head, dumping a pile of work on me after I’d busted my ass all day trying to earn the right to go home on time.\nI absolutely could not suffer the same fate as back then.\n\"The same applies to the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword. I may have quickly learned the forms, but my internal energy is still lacking. Therefore, I believe it would be beneficial to dedicate the remaining time to cultivating my internal energy through breathing exercises.\"\nI won't go down easily.\n\"Hmmm. You make a valid point,\" Master conceded.\nAnd so it began: the psychological chess match between a boss trying to assign overtime and an employee trying to escape it.\n\"Then, to supplement your lacking internal energy, I shall instruct the medical wing to prepare the Explosive Demon Pill for you.\"\n\"...What is the Explosive Demon Pill?\"\n“It’s one of the elixirs crafted by our Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, renowned for explosively increasing one's internal energy. A truly remarkable elixir.\"\nAnd with that, my defeat was sealed.\n\"Besides, since you'll be accompanied by Hayeon, it won't greatly interfere with your studies.\"\nMaster swiftly blocked even my last escape route.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 16 : Business Trip (1)",
    "content": "Chapter 16: Business Trip (1)\nAs I predicted, the task Master had for me was a follow-up to my big idea at the banquet.\nBut he wasn't just telling me to design a whole new system from scratch.\n\"Your suggestion was quite excellent, but it was also a suggestion made without fully understanding the actual circumstances of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. Therefore, let us first familiarize you with the realities of our Cult,\" Master declared.\nSaying so, Master instructed that I should first go and grasp the situation in the regions governed by the Divine Cult.\nIn other words, I had to go on a business trip.\nAnd our gracious Master, who was kind enough to make me grind my teeth, gave me two days instead of leaving immediately.\n\"You should bid farewell to that child. She might be quite anxious if you suddenly disappear,\" he added, his gaze fixed on me with an oddly amused glint.\nThough I couldn't decipher the meaning behind his look, I was grateful for the opportunity to say goodbye to Seon-ah the following day.\n\"Do you have to go...?\" she pleaded, her eyes welling up.\n\"Urgh...\"\nMy heart aches at the eyes of the little child looking up at me so desperately. However, my sadness wasn't solely due to her cuteness.\n'I don't want to go either!!!'\nThe fact that this wasn't a voluntary trip made the situation twice as distressing.\nYet, I couldn't explain the truth about being forced to go.\n\"Seon-ah. Big Brother is a disciple of the Supreme One.\"\nI couldn't badmouth Master in front of Jin Hayeon who was watching with cold eyes from the side.\n\"Because I am the disciple of the great Heavenly Demon, I have various duties to fulfill. So, even while I'm away, you must diligently study and practice every day.\"\n\"Why...?\"\n“Because someday, I’m going to be even busier. I like playing with Seon-ah, but if Seon-ah becomes smarter and better at martial arts, we can work together instead of just playing. Then we can be together all the time, right?\"\n\"Ah!\"\nAs if struck by a sudden realization, Seon-a's already large eyes widened further, and she nodded vigorously. Charmed by her cuteness, I patted her head and extended my pinky finger.\n\"I'll bring you a gift when I return. So make sure you study hard while I'm gone, okay?\"\n\"Yes!! I'll definitely become an excellent person and work together with Big Brother!\"\nAfter finishing my brief farewell with Seon-ah, it was time for training with Master again.\n\"Since you've learned all the main forms of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword. Today, let's learn the forms of footwork and movement techniques.\"\nWith those words, Master gracefully moved around Windrock Palace. Astonishingly, deep footprints were left wherever he stepped.\n\"Follow these footprints and execute the movements I demonstrated.\"\nSo for the next two hours, I basically jumped and spun and twisted my body all over the place, trying to keep up with his instructions. By the time the movements of the lightness technique and footwork started to become familiar, the training session came to an end.\nThe next morning...\n\"Huaaam.\"\nI was all packed and ready to go. I stretched and yawned as Jin Hayeon led me away. She was carrying a pack with all my study material. Following her lead, we traversed the inner grounds of the Demonic Cult.\nWe soon arrived at a location where a large carriage was parked.\n\"Haha. Come on in.\"\nAnd sitting inside was Master. He’d gotten there early, what with being an old guy who wakes up at the crack of dawn. Follow current novᴇls on NoveIꜰire.net\nTo my surprise, he would be accompanying me on this trip.\nOnce Jin Hayeon and I boarded, the coachman, who also served as a bodyguard, set the carriage in motion.\nAs we passed the cult's ground and entered a forested path, lush greenery filled the view from the carriage window.\n'Maybe because Master is with us, it feels quite relaxing.'\nIt felt more like going on a casual trip somewhere than a business trip.\nAs I was enjoying the forest bathing in the carriage since early morning.\nThump.\nThe carriage suddenly stopped, and Master looked at me and spoke.\n\"Get off now.\"\n\"???\"\nThere wasn't a village in sight. Why would I get off here?\nConfused, I obeyed.\nThe scene outside was even more perplexing.\n'Why am I the only one getting off?\nAs if reading my expression, Master spoke from inside the carriage.\n\"From now on, run after us.\"\n\"!?\"\nBefore I could react, the carriage started moving again.\n'Are you crazy!?'\nShocked, I quickly moved my feet to chase after the carriage. Oddly enough, the carriage was moving at quite a leisurely pace as if matching my running speed.\nAnd when I finally managed to catch up to the carriage's side, Master spoke.\n\"Have you forgotten the movement techniques I taught you yesterday? This too is part of your training. In any situation, whenever you run, move according to the movement technique's principle until those movements are completely ingrained in your body.\"\nOnly then could I fully grasp the situation.\nThe reason Master gave me two days' grace was not out of consideration for me to say farewell to Seon-ah.\nIt was because he needed time to teach me the movement techniques.\n'Wait a minute... maybe the entire reason he waited this long to give me a mission was for this.'\nMaster had a plan all along—a plan to efficiently exploit my abilities. Just then, his sharp voice cut through the air.\n\"Your posture is wrong. Focus. Do you think an enemy's sword will miss you in a real battle just because you're tired? Your form must be flawless, even under the most strenuous circumstances.\"\nThis was going to be one hell of a business trip.\n\"The angle of your waist is wrong.\"\n\"My apologies. It is due to this lowly one's inadequate martial arts instruction,\" Jin Hayeon chimed in, echoing Master's nagging.\nHow long had I been running while enduring their relentless criticism? Just as my mind began to cloud over…\nThud.\nThe carriage running alongside me stopped.\n\"Get in.\"\n\"Huff... huff...\"\nCompletely out of breath, I clumsily climbed aboard and gulped down the water from a flask offered by Jin Hayeon.\n\"Regulate your breathing by exercising your breathing technique. It might be uncomfortable at first, but there's nothing better than breathing exercises to restore a tired body and stabilize your breathing,\" Master instructed with his tone sterner than usual.\nSuppressing a sigh, I assumed the lotus position inside the carriage.\n\" Inhale ... Exhale .\"\nI took a deep breath, guiding the surrounding energy deep into my lungs. As I controlled this energy, circulating it through my meridians according to the principles of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, transforming it into demonic energy, a sudden thought jolted me.\n'Shit.'\nI almost flinched without realizing it.\nMaybe it was because I was so out of breath, or maybe it was the rattling of the carriage.\nWhatever the reason, the energy inside me was going haywire. I felt sharp pangs of pain as it surged violently through my body.\nThat’s when it really hit me. This wasn’t some safe, orthodox cultivation method.\nThis is a Demonic Art.\nUnlike the stable techniques of the righteous sects, Demonic Arts were volatile and prone to causing Qi Deviation.\nIt’s a pain to control when you are in perfect condition, and it’s an even more pain in the ass when you are much worse.\nBut stopping the energy flow halfway through was even riskier than continuing.\nWith the feeling of walking on thin ice, I carefully operated my internal energy.\n\" Inhale ... Exhale ...\"\nI focused my mind while breathing as deeply and slowly as possible.\nAfter repeating several small cycles like this, the violently raging Demonic Energy gradually began to stabilize, and seizing the opportunity, I put it back into my dantian.\n'Whoa. My absorption level actually jumped up a lot.'\nI took one last deep breath and opened my eyes, feeling a cold trickle of sweat run down my back.\n\"Hahaha. As expected, I knew you could do it, Il-mok,\" Master chuckled.\n\"...Did you intentionally make me practice my breathing technique in a dangerous situation?\"\nWhen I asked back in a voice that had become blunt without my realizing it, the crazy old geezer smiled with satisfaction and stroked his beard.\n\"As a martial artist, you will often encounter situations where you must practice breathing exercises in unstable physical or mental states.\"\n\"...Was it truly necessary to practice that now?\" I countered, implying that such training would be more appropriate after attaining a higher level of mastery.\nMaster shook his head. “You have it backwards. It’s far more dangerous for a master to lose control. Think of it this way: what’s worse, a small creek overflowing its banks, or the whole great river flooding?”\n“So Master is saying Master put me through that now because my power level is still low enough that it wouldn't kill me?”\n“Hahaha! Exactly! You understand my words well. And besides, if you had lost control, your internal energy is not yet so vast that I couldn't intervene. If you possessed even a sixth of the internal energy of, say, your Sixth Senior Brother, even I could not guarantee your safety.”\nAs expected, Master had it all planned out.\n‘It would be really nice if he would just share that plan.’\nWhile I was feeling such regret inside, the carriage suddenly lurched to a halt.\nNoticing my puzzled expression, Master stared blankly at me before speaking. \"What are you doing? Why aren't you getting off?\"\n“Are we there already?”\n\"Now that you've rested enough, shouldn't you practice lightness skill again?\"\n\"...\"\nFor a moment, I was speechless and looked back and forth between my master and Jin Hayeon.\nI got off the carriage with a sigh.\n'Fuck.'\nThat word kept echoing in my mind.\nFortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, the village wasn't far. By the time we began the third round of my training, our destination was visible in the distance.\n\"Let's end this training when we reach that village.\"\nThat was all the motivation I needed. I ran towards the village with the fervor of a traveler discovering an oasis in the desert.\nIronically, Master's plan had worked.\nI don't know if it was because of the sheer desperation or because this body is just ridiculously talented, but the footwork techniques were now second nature.\nMaster had even stopped nagging at me. Even with my mind half-absent, my body instinctively executed the movements. As I blindly ran towards the distant village…\n…it gradually grew larger until the carriage and I finally arrived at its outskirts.\n\"Giddy up!\"\nNeigh!\nAs we neared the village, the carriage stopped, and Master and Jin Hayeon, who had been traveling comfortably in the carriage until now, got off with calm steps.\nI, drenched in sweat, entered the village together with them while half out of my mind.\n\"Long live the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons!!!\"\nThe loud shouts coming from all directions made my clouded mind snap back to attention.\nWhen I looked around, people who seemed to be residents of this village were all shouting with their entire bodies prostrated on the ground.\n\"Oh, Heavenly Demon!\"\n\"Please save us!!\"\n\"Please keep us from falling into evil!!\"\nWatching that scene gave me goosebumps.\n'They're acting as if they're welcoming a god.'\nAt Tianshan Mountain Range, the headquarters of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, I had put up with it thinking that was just how it was, considering the inherently cultish nature of the place.\nHowever, witnessing such fervent reactions in an ordinary village was unsettling.\nI never expected such an intense reaction even in a village where ordinary civilians lived.\n'Is this the power of a cult?'\nIt was a terrifying sight to behold.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 17 : Business Trip (2)",
    "content": "Chapter 17: Business Trip (2)\n“Ahhh! O Lord of Ten Thousand Demons!!”\n\"The Heavenly Demon has graced us with his presence!”\nSpurred by the initial villagers who were prostrating themselves and shouting, the number of people coming to pay their respects seemed to increase with each passing moment. At this rate, the villagers would soon overflow the narrow village entrance.\n‘I can understand their ignorance, but what is Master thinking?’\nDon’t tell me the old man is just a giant attention whore?\n‘Then again, you probably can’t be a cult leader unless you have a penchant for the spotlight.’\nWhile I was busy psychoanalyzing him, Master walked toward the villagers with a much more solemn expression than usual.\n\"Ahhh!\"\n“The Heavenly Demon Descends! Ten Thousand Demons Rejoice!!”\n\"The Heavenly Demon has come to save us!\"\nThe villagers closest to him started shaking like they were high, their faces filled with pure ecstasy as they babbled nonsense.\nAs he walked, Master occasionally stopped to stroke their bowed heads or gently clasped their hands pressed against the ground. It was a masterful display of showmanship.\nThe reactions of those who received Master's blessing were truly a sight to behold. Tears streamed down their faces, some collapsed with foam at their mouths, and others convulsed, staring intently at the spot where my Master's hand had touched them.\n'What the fuck is this?'\nFollowing closely behind Master, I found the scene less astonishing and more disturbing.\nIt was a bizarre scene.\nI had witnessed similar scenes a few times when I was Seo Ji-hoon, not in person, of course, but through the internet and YouTube. I had seen videos of cult leaders mimicking the projection of energy, causing followers to collapse dramatically, or chanting strange incantations while gripping a follower's head, inducing convulsions and frothing at the mouth.\nBack then, I’d watched that stuff and laughed, ‘What is wrong with these idiots?’\nBut seeing it in person wasn't funny—it was frightening.\nWhat the hell made these people so devoted to this cult?\nEspecially considering they were ordinary civilians, untouched by the influence of Demonic Arts.\nAnd the funny thing was, the more I thought about them, the more Master’s actions started to make a terrifying kind of sense.\n'Is this why he insisted on traveling in person instead of using the carriage?'\nWhatever the reason, they are fanatics, and to them, Master is a god.\nA modern analogy would be the relationship between a superstar and their devoted fans.\nImagine eagerly waiting in line to see your favorite celebrity, only to have them drive by without a second glance.\nDisappointing, right?\nBut what if that celebrity suddenly stepped out of their car and started shaking hands and taking pictures with everyone?\nThe fans would be completely enthralled.\nWith minimal effort, Master transformed casual followers into fanatics.\nI couldn't help but shiver at Master's subtle but detailed calculations.\nIt took about two incense sticks' worth of time to pass through the villagers who had come to see Master and reach the branch headquarters.\nLooking back, the village entrance wasn't that far.\nA distance that could be covered in one incense stick at a leisurely pace had taken us two incense sticks to walk.\n'They still haven't dispersed,' I noted, observing the thousands still prostrating themselves and speaking in tongues between the branch headquarters and the village entrance.\n\"The Heavenly Demon Descents! Ten Thousand Demons Obeys!! Ma Gang-il, the Branch Leader of Aksu, greets the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons.\"\nA voice boomed, cutting through the villagers' clamor. I turned to see a burly man prostrating himself before the building.\n\"Rise.\"\nThe man who stood up at Master's command was a middle-aged man with a fierce face.\n\"Let us go inside first. If this old man stays here any longer, the masses won't be able to continue their livelihoods.\"\n\"As the Heavenly Demon commands.\"\n\"Tell the branch members to calm and disperse the villagers after we go inside.\"\n\"By your command!\"\nMaster quickly gave his orders and headed inside the building with the Branch Leader.\nJin Hayeon and I followed closely behind.\n\"You must be hungry after your journey. I shall have a meal prepared,\" Branch Leader Ma Gang-il offered as he led us inside.\nMaster shook his head at Branch Leader Ma Gang-il's words.\n“My youngest disciple was training hard on the road. He’s drenched in sweat. Let’s let him get cleaned up and rest first. We can eat later.”\nAt Master's words, the Branch Leader's gaze fixed on me.\n“Ah! So you’re the new disciple I’ve heard so much about! Hahaha!”\nUnlike his grim face, the Branch Leader laughed cheerfully and acted friendly towards me.\n“Then we will begin the meal in about two hours. I will give the order to prepare warm water for bathing. In the meantime, allow me to escort the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons to his quarters.\"\n\"Very well.\"\nOnce the conversation between my Master and the Branch Leader ended, Jin Hayeon quietly spoke to my Master.\n\"Then, until the bath water is ready, this servant will perform a massage on Young Master Il-mok’s body.\"\n\"Go ahead.\"\nJin Hayeon and I were led to a separate room where she applied acupressure and massage to soothe my exhausted muscles.\n\"Whew. I feel alive again.\"\nMy body, which had been exhausted from the brutally intense qi circulation and lightness skill training, became somewhat drowsy thanks to the massage and warm bath.\nAfter a nice long rest, one of the local cult members came to take us to dinner.\n\"Eat.\"\nMaster instructed, picking up his chopsticks and taking the first bite. Our belated lunch commenced.\n\"Tell me, how are the teachings progressing among the people of Aksu County?\"\nAnd true to the ways of boomer, Master wasted no time delving into business matters during the meal.\n\"Every day, the branch members and I go around the village and take care of the villagers. In the process, we gradually teach them the doctrines written in the Secret Record of the Heavenly Demon. We would like to distribute the scriptures directly and have them study, but there are not many people who are literate, so we have no choice but to convey the teachings verbally.\"\nThe questioning continued, with Master peppering the Branch Leader with inquiries. The poor guy was so stressed that he barely touched his food. It was almost sad to watch.\nMunch\nMunch\nMeanwhile, I was busy stuffing food into my mouth without pause.\nWhen I was somewhat full, my Master's barrage of questions towards the Branch Leader finally came to an end, but the target suddenly switched to me.\n\"What do you think, Il-mok?\"\n\"...About what, Master?\"\n\"Do you see any way to improve this place based on the system you previously described?\"\nYou pushed me around since morning, and now you want to give me more work?\nI hid my exasperated thoughts and answered.\n\"I haven't looked around enough yet, so nothing comes to mind at the moment.\"\n\"Haha. That's understandable. After the meal, go around the county with the Branch Leader.\"\n\"As you wish, Master.\"\nA tour of the county sounded like a leisurely sightseeing opportunity.\n‘Even if something does come to mind, I should just pretend I don’t know and move on,' I decided. I had no desire to increase my workload.\nWith my work-dodging plan firmly in place, I picked up my chopsticks to finish my meal. And that's when Master dropped the bomb. \"If you find nothing noteworthy in Aksu County, we shall visit other locations.\"\n\"Where else would we...\"\n\"There are plenty of places to go. How many counties do you think follow our Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's teachings?\"\n\"...\"\nI got the message loud and clear. If I didn't come up with something good, this \"business trip\" would never end.\nAnd every leg of the journey would mean another \"training session\" like the one from this morning. Read full story at NoveI★Fire.net\nMoreover, Xinjiang boasted an unnecessarily vast territory. Much larger than South and North Korea combined.\n'I'm fucked.'\nIf I didn't come up with something brilliant today, it seemed I was destined for a nationwide tour.\nAnd that nationwide tour would be on foot.\nAfter the stifling meal with Master, I departed the branch headquarters with Jin Hayeon and Branch Leader Ma Gang-il.\n\"Hahaha. It's an honor to be able to introduce Aksu County to you, Young Master.\"\nBranch Leader Ma Gang-il spoke while showing a smile on his fierce-looking face.\nDespite the scene resembling a nepo baby flaunting their parents’ influence on a senior’s workplace from the modern world, he showed no signs of displeasure.\nAs he showed us around, I was struck by how normal everything seemed. The crazy, fanatical welcome from earlier had completely vanished. It was just a regular county now.\n'Well, it's been over one and a half incense sticks since Master entered the headquarters.'\nUnder the crimson sky that was just beginning to darken, villagers busily went about their business.\n\"Oh my. You should have told us if you weren't feeling well.\"\nUnlike his fierce appearance, Branch Leader Ma Gang-il approached village elders with a sociable attitude.\n\"Oh dear. How could we burden such busy people doing important work with something like this?\"\n\"Hahaha. Helping all of you is that important work, elder.\"\nHe effortlessly lifted the heavy bundle the hunched elder was carrying while chatting.\nWatching this, I quietly asked the elder a question.\n\"Elder, could you tell me what kind of important work you mentioned earlier?\"\nAt my question, the elder's gaze turned toward Branch Leader Ma Gang-il.\nA look that seemed to ask who this young fellow was to be asking such questions.\nMa Kang-il didn’t miss a beat. He just chuckled and said, “Hahaha! You saw him earlier, Elder. This is the Heavenly Demon’s new disciple.”\nAs soon as his answer finished, the elder was startled and suddenly tried to kneel on the ground.\nI had to lunge forward and physically hold him up to stop him. The last thing I needed was a guy old enough to be my grandfather bowing to me.\n\"That's not necessary.\"\n“B-But how can I not pay my respects to a disciple of the Heavenly Demon?”\n\"It's fine. I'm here on a secret mission now, so it would be more troublesome if people's attention were drawn to us.\"\nOnly after I said that it would be troublesome for me did the elder give up trying to bow on the ground. He still seemed a little restless, though.\nNo matter what I said, it seemed things would remain uncomfortable as long as I was here, so I asked another question to quickly finish my business and leave.\n\"Elder, could you tell me what kind of important work you mentioned earlier?\"\n\"W-well, isn't it the work of protecting us?\"\nThe elder's story that followed was simpler than I expected.\nXinjiang, with its mountainous terrain and vast deserts, had always been plagued by bandits and raiders who established their bases near oases or within mountain ranges. On top of that, you had criminals spilling over from other countries. Life was already hard enough out here, but with them around, it was basically hell on earth.\nAnd then, the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult took root here in Xinjiang, cutting a large number of bandits and villains, making this desolate place a somewhat more livable world for ordinary people.\n\"I heard stories from my great-grandfather that back then, they had to worry every day about whether mountain or desert bandits would attack.\"\n\"...Pardon?\"\nWhen I made a puzzled expression at the elder's last words, Jin Hayeon, who had been listening beside us, spoke up.\n“It’s been two hundred years since our Heavenly Demon Divine Cult took root in this region. Since then, we’ve gradually expanded our influence and now we have complete control over the Tianshan Mountain Range.”\nThanks to her explanation, I recalled what I had heard from her before.\n'Ah, that's right, we were branded as traitors by the Imperial Court two hundred years ago.'\nIt seemed that they came over to Xinjiang from the Central Plains at that time and gradually expanded the area they managed.\n\"Though it's less frequent than in my great-grandfather's time, mountain and desert bandits still appear occasionally even now. And whenever that happens, the cult's warriors protect us. A few years back, my own son was attacked by raiders on his way to Urumqi on a business trip! But the cult's warriors saved my son.\"\n\"Those who rescued the elder’s son were likely part of the patrol unit from the combat units, Young Master Il-mok,\" Ma Gang-il added, ensuring credit was given where it was due.\n\"Actually, Aksu County rarely sees such incidents because it's close to the main headquarters. So, we mainly focus on helping village residents with their livelihoods, like this.\"\nAfter hearing that far, I could more or less understand how things were operating.\n'The branch headquarters in each region are like parishes?'\nThey cared for the local population, assisted with various tasks, and spread the cult's teachings. They also served as a security force, suppressing disturbances and combating bandits and raiders.\nIt now made sense why even ordinary citizens had become as fanatical as the cultists at the headquarters. For nearly two hundred years, the cult had been subtly indoctrinating them while providing aid. I doubted I could have resisted such constant influence.\nHowever, to put it another way.\n'To think they've been operating with the same methods for two hundred years… The South Korean civil service system feels like a modern marvel in comparison.'\nIt was dizzying in many ways.\nStill, it wasn't a bad situation for me.\n'With this, there's more than enough to change.'\nIf their entire operation was this basic, there were a million things I could fix.\nOf course.\n'I should minimize my involvement to avoid as much work as possible.'\nI had no intention of falling into work hell again.",

    "content": "Chapter 18: Business Trip (3)\nAfter that, I continued walking around Aksu County with Jin Hayeon and Branch Leader Ma Gang-il, observing the villagers and asking questions.\nAfter about an hour of patrolling, the sky had turned completely black.\nMost of the residents had already gone home, and there were hardly any people visible in the village, so we returned to the branch office.\n“So, Young Master. Anything come to mind?”\nWhen Jin Hayeon asked, Branch Leader Ma Gang-il also looked at me with interest.\n\"I have a few things in mind.\"\nThough I said a few, honestly, there were too many to count.\nAnd why wouldn't I be? From my perspective as someone who had lived in modern times, their way of life was too antiquated.\nThe list of things that needed to change was endless, but I had no plans to tackle all of them.\nThat would only lead to a terrible hell of paperwork.\nMy only concern was this: What could I fix that would be just enough to keep my Master happy, without landing me any extra work?\nLost in thought, I suddenly felt a strange sensation and turned my head.\n\"???\"\nFor some reason, Branch Leader Ma Gang-il was standing still, staring at me with a surprised face.\nEven Jin Hayeon seemed somewhat surprised.\n‘She’s… Surprised?’\nHaving spent all day together for the past half-month, I could tell her expression was slightly different from usual.\n\"Is there some problem?\"\nWhen I asked in a blunt tone, the surprised Branch Leader Ma Gang-il answered, \"As expected of someone chosen by the Supreme One. To find not just one, but several things to change in mere hours...\"\n\"Ah...\"\nOnly then did I notice my mistake.\nBranch Leader Ma Gang-il had probably worked here for at least several years. My offhand comment could easily be interpreted as an insult to his experience. However, true to his nature as a fanatic, he showed no signs of being offended or jealous.\nInstead, he seemed overwhelmed with admiration.\nMy mistake wasn't about offending him. It was about…\n'...I need to be more careful.'\nLike during the previous banquet and today too, things that seemed completely obvious to me were often viewed as surprising by these people.\n'I thought they'd only be amazed by technology like smartphones, TVs, or even light bulbs.'\nThere was a common cliché that used to appear in Japanese manga or novels where a character from the modern world would astound the inhabitants of a fantasy world with everyday items.\n—Ah, this is what we call a lighter.\n—Ah, this is what we call a K-2 assault rifle.\nBeing a humanities major, I had dismissed such scenarios, as I couldn't even create a lighter, let alone a rifle.\nWhen I first arrived in this world, I'd considered advocating for democracy. But in a world ruled by the Imperial Family, that kind of talk would lead me to my swift execution as a rebel. Since I was just a lowly inn waiter, I obviously just kept my head down and played dumb to survive.\nWhich is why I never noticed that the stuff I know from my humanities degree could seem like a miracle to these people.\n\"Indeed. The Supreme One's judgment is impeccable,\" Jin Hayeon declared.\nFortunately, the two fanatics beside me simply attributed my insights to Master's brilliance.\n'Thank goodness they're idiots,' I thought.\nI opened my mouth to subtly change the topic.\n\"By the way, Branch Leader Ma Gang-il, you don't seem to suffer from the side effects of Demonic Arts. Have you perhaps achieved Transcendence?\"\nFrom what I'd observed while working together until now, he always burst into hearty, cheerful laughter that didn't match his fierce face while mingling with villagers.\nHe didn't feel at all like a Demonic Art practitioner.\nBut Branch Leader Ma Gang-il hastily waved his arms at my question like I’d said something ridiculous.\n\"Hahaha. How could a mere Branch Leader like me achieve Transcendence? I just learned Demonic Art with a mild side effect, so it's not very noticeable. Young Master. Hahaha.\"\nHis mention of Demonic Arts with a mild side effect piqued my curiosity.\n\"If you don't mind, could you tell me what the side effect is?\"\n\"Hahaha. It's nothing much. Just a minor side effect where I tend to feel happy for some reason. Hahaha.\"\n\"...\"\nApparently, the side effect was mania.\n\"Actually, the Demonic Art I practice is said to induce uncontrollable laughter and mental instability at the Extremity stage, even in dire situations. One could even suffer seizures from laughing too hard. But my talent is limited, so I haven't reached Extremity yet. It's… fortunate, yet unfortunate. Hahahaha!\"\n\"...\"\nMaybe because I now knew the diagnosis.\nHis hearty laughter somehow felt pitiful.\nAfter returning to the branch headquarters, I was able to learn new knowledge about the Demonic Cult through Jin Hayeon.\nShe said that people like Branch Leader Ma Gang-il who regularly interact with local residents generally learn \"relatively\" safe Demonic Arts.\nIn other words, those assigned to branch headquarters typically either learned arts with side effects that were less likely to harm others or their cultivation level was low.\nHigh-ranking cultists who had mastered powerful Demonic Arts from the Hall of the Demonic Way were typically assigned to the combat units, patrolling Xinjiang, undertaking missions, or stationed at the cult's headquarters.\nIt made sense. Placing individuals like my Eldest Brother, with his intermittent explosive disorder, or my Third Brother, plagued by paranoia, among ordinary civilians would be disastrous.\nShe also mentioned that while uncommon, some practitioners outside of the Hall of the Demonic Way who demonstrated exceptional talent and achievements could be promoted from branch headquarters to the combat units or the main headquarters’ divisions.\n\"Have all your questions been answered?\"\nWhen I nodded at Jin Hayeon's question, she rummaged through her bundle and pulled out some books, ink, and paper.\n\"Why are you taking those out?\"\n\"Now that you've finished all your tasks for today, shouldn't we start studying the doctrine?\"\n\"Ah...\"\nBetween the grueling movement technique training I endured this morning and the village patrol in the afternoon, I had completely forgotten.\n\"I miss my diary.\"\nAt my frustrated muttering, Jin Hayeon tilted her head and asked.\n\"What did you say, Young Master?\"\nJin Hayeon couldn't understand since I had mumbled in Korean.\nThe next morning.\nAfter bathing and practicing my breathing technique, the joyous occasion of breakfast arrived—breakfast with Master.\n\"Hahaha. Eat comfortably.\" Master said with a benevolent smile. But as soon as I lifted my spoon, he launched into his questioning.\n\"So, did yesterday's tour inspire any thoughts?\"\nAs expected, Master couldn't distinguish between meal time and work time.\nSwallowing my sigh, I put down my spoon and opened my mouth.\n\"I thought of one thing, Master.\"\n\"Oh? I'm curious about what you might have thought of.\"\nBranch Leader Ma Gang-il also put down his spoon and looked at me curiously.\nAfter looking back and forth at the faces of the two old men staring at me with anticipation, I took a breath and laid it out.\n\"We should establish schools in every village and have our cult's branches teach the children.\"\n\"Schools... Is there a specific reason for this?\"\n\"The biggest reason I thought of schools was because of Branch Leader Ma Gang-il's story.\"\nNo sooner had I finished speaking than Master's gaze turned toward Branch Leader Ma Gang-il.\nUnder that intense stare, the Branch Leader let out his trademark manic laugh, so I jumped in to explain.\n\"Didn't you mention yesterday that most villagers are illiterate, forcing you to teach the doctrines verbally?\"\n\"Hmm. He certainly did say that. However, in that case, shouldn't we teach adults as well, not just children?\"\n\"There is no need to do that. They are already devout believers. Also, they are too busy making a living to have time to study characters.\"\nMaster frowned. \"You are implying while the adults are already devout believers, the children are not.\"\n\"!!!\"\nMa Gang-il immediately leaped from his chair, prostrated himself, and began banging his head on the floor.\n\"It's my negligence, Supreme One! I will work more actively to spread the teachings to young children!\"\nSeeing Ma Gang-il bleeding from his forehead, I quickly interjected, \"It's not the Branch Leader's fault! The circumstances have changed!\"\n\"The circumstances have changed? Elaborate.\"\nCold sweat drips down involuntarily.\nWhile Master wouldn't harm me right away, I didn't know what might happen to Branch Leader Ma Gang-il if I said the wrong thing.\n\"The way our Heavenly Demonic Divine Cult has expanded its influence is simple. We protected the common people of Xinjiang from the wicked, and in the process, we spread our doctrines. However, it has already been nearly two hundred years, so now there are almost no bandits or evildoers left in Xinjiang. Especially in Aksu, which is close to the main headquarters, I heard that they are almost extinct.\"\n“So the changed situation you speak of means that the villains have decreased?”\n\"Exactly. While the older generation is deeply grateful to our Cult, the younger generation cannot relate to their experiences. Furthermore, human nature is inherently evil. When kindness overflowed continuously, they tend to view it as a right.\"\nAdding a famous quote from a certain movie to reinforce my argument, Master nodded with an \"Indeed.\"\nMy words aligned with one of the core tenets of the cult's doctrine: \"Human nature is fundamentally evil.\"\n\"So, you're saying that children, having never experienced significant hardship, might take our benevolence for granted.\"\n\"Yes, Master. Moreso when adding the fact while it is less egregious than the wicked Imperial Court, our Cult still collects offerings. If this keeps up, there's a real risk someone down the line will start asking, 'Why do we even have to pay the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult?'”\n\"That's a valid concern.\" Master, seemingly convinced, turned to the still kneeling Ma Gang-il. \"Branch Leader, rise. As my disciple said, you are not to blame.\"\n\"U-Understood, Lord of Ten Thousand Demons.\"\nMa Gang-il got to his feet, still looking completely dumbfounded, and stared at me with pure awe.\nThat look, combined with the blood trickling down his shocked face, was even more burdensome than usual.\nBut Master seemed unconcerned about such things, merely glancing at the risen Ma Gang-il before looking back at me.\n\"So ultimately, you're suggesting we use the warriors of each of the cult’s branches to teach children both letters and doctrine.\"\n\"Yes. Humans are greatly influenced by what they see growing up. The gratitude for receiving an education, coupled with early exposure to our teachings, will greatly increase their likelihood of becoming devout followers.\"\n\"However, you've overlooked one thing. As you said, commoners barely make ends meet. Will children have the leisure to attend school while they're busy helping with their parents?\"\n\"That's why we have them.\"\nI answered while pointing at Branch Leader Ma Gang-il.\n\"The branch members have been helping with odd jobs since the rate of criminality decreased, correct? It’s enough for the branch to set aside one or two members to teach the children. The rest can just do their usual duty.”\n\"Haha. As expected, you have thought of everything. Your excellent comprehension, combined with the side effects of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, has produced a very excellent result.\"\n\"I, I guess so. Ha, haha.\"\nI couldn’t exactly correct him, so I just had to laugh it off awkwardly. Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on novelFɪre.net\nAfter that general framework was set, Master and I began discussing the details.\n\"First, we should begin with the Thousand Character Classic. Even young children can master it within a year.\"\n“Good point. However, as you know, the Secret Record of the Heavenly Demon contains characters beyond the scope of the Thousand Character Classic.\"\n\"We can't teach children the Secret Record of the Heavenly Demon directly since it contains much difficult content. We need to create a simplified doctrine book for children using only characters from the Thousand Character Classic.\"\n\"Hmm. Since we have time while they learn the Thousand Character Classic, we can create the simplified doctrine book during that year.\"\n\"Yes. If we teach children this way for about two years, all children in Xinjiang will be reborn as followers of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\"\n\"Hahaha. In that case, the task of creating this simplified doctrine…”\nBefore Master could finish speaking, I quickly interrupted.\n\"It requires the expertise of those well-versed in the scriptures and with long-standing experience within the Cult. While I wish to undertake this task myself, I haven't even mastered half of the scriptures. Assigning it to me risks disseminating inaccurate information.\"\nI couldn't allow my workload to increase again.\nIn fact, I had chosen schools among various options precisely because I had this in mind.\nThe people operating the schools would be the branch members from each region. It had nothing to do with me.\nThe same went for the simplified doctrine book. A newbie like me couldn't possibly write it.\n“You’re right. It does seem a little too soon for you to take on this job, Il-mok.”\nAt Master's words, I almost let out a cheer of joy.\n'I dodged the extra work bullet!'\nHaving achieved my goal, I quickly opened my mouth to prevent my Master from setting another trap.\n\"Master, the food is getting cold.\"\n\"Ahem. You're right. I’ll sort out the rest of the details when I get back to the headquarters. For now, let's enjoy our meal.\"\nYou could have confused it for a board meeting, but we were clearly in the middle of 'breakfast.'\nBut even after we got the green light from the master, a relaxing meal was out of the question.\n\"W-wouldn't it be better for Branch Leader Ma Gang-il to treat his head a little and then eat?\"\nMa Gang-il was casually spooning food into his mouth with dried blood caking his forehead.\nBut Ma Gang-il merely laughed heartily at my consideration.\n\"Hahaha. It's fine. It's already dried up, so it doesn't matter much. More importantly, as expected of the Supreme One and his disciple. I was so caught up listening, I didn’t even realize I was bleeding! Hahaha.”\nBranch Leader Ma Gang-il was simply bright and cheerful.",

    "content": "Chapter 19: Side Effect (1)\nI guess my idea was decent enough, because Master ordered us to head back right after breakfast. Which meant…\n\"Run well on your way back.\"\nOnce again, the hellish training began.\nJust like when we came to visit Aksu, I returned to the main headquarters after alternating between riding in a carriage three times and running according to the principles of lightness skill.\n\"Huff...\"\nWhile I was struggling to catch my breath, Master leisurely stepped down from the carriage and spoke with a gentle smile.\n\"Well done. You've done enough lightness skill training for today, so we'll skip the training with me in the afternoon.\"\nMaster spoke as if bestowing a great favor.\nBut after all that agony, was I supposed to be happy with that? Hell no.\n\"Whew. Master, when will I get the Explosive Demonic Pill?\"\nI hadn't forgotten the promised elixir, a symbol of fortuitous encounters in every martial arts novel.\nHe had promised to give me that elixir if I successfully completed this business trip.\n'If I consume the elixir, it will be much easier to enter the Hall of the Demonic Way.'\nAnd once that hurdle was cleared, I wouldn't have to endure this relentless schedule. My dream — work-life balance — would finally be within reach!\nHowever, Master shook his head.\nJust before the word ‘liar’ could unconsciously slip out, the shameless old man added.\n\"Your dantian is not yet sufficiently developed to handle the Explosive Demonic Pill. I will bestow it upon you once your dantian is more stable and your meridians are strengthened.\"\n\"Is that so...?\"\nA naturally disappointed tone slipped out.\n'He's not trying to just brush it off with words and forget about it, right?'\nMy past experiences as Seo Ji-hoon had made me inherently distrustful.\n'Surely this isn't like those shitty small companies that don't keep their promised performance bonus?'\nWhile the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult was a massive organization, dwarfing even South Korea's largest corporations, their haphazard way of doing things made this a legitimate concern.\nHowever, I couldn't carelessly run my mouth.\nSetting aside the evil corporate chairman geezer, the fanatic Jin Hayeon was likely to unleash her sword dance upon me.\nShortly after Master left...\nKnock, knock.\nA knocking sound echoed through the door of Windrock Palace.\nFollowing that, a familiar little face peeked from behind the door. After nervously scanning the room, her eyes lit up upon seeing me.\n\"Big Brother~!\"\nI patted Little Seon-ah's head as she ran over and jumped into my arms, \"Did you study and train hard while I was gone?\"\nIn response to my question, Seon-ah beamed at me and started chattering a mile a minute.\nAbout the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's doctrines she had learned over the past two days, and about how to kill people using the Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art.\n\"...\"\nThe fuck are these lunatics teaching a kid?\nAs I wondered in dismay, I realized that it was unavoidable given that this was a cult-like martial organization.\nI sighed internally. Then, I noticed the sudden silence. Seon-ah had finished her excited recounting and was now gazing up at me expectantly.\n\"Our Seon-ah really worked hard to keep her promise with Big Brother. Then, I should give Seon-ah a present, shouldn't I?\"\nI rummaged through my belongings and took out something I had picked up in Aksu.\nIt was a hairpin.\nI’d picked it up for her last night while patrolling Aksu.\nI thought of the little girl who would be waiting for me and bought a hairpin.\nI carefully placed the hairpin in her long, crimson-tinged hair.\n'Hmm. Is this how you do it?'\nIt felt somewhat off since I had never used a hairpin myself nor put one on someone else.\nBut Seon-ah looked nothing but happy after receiving my gift.\nAs I was watching Seon-ah's brightly smiling face with the crooked hairpin. A cold voice penetrated my ears.\n\"Lady Seon-ah, would you excuse us? The Young Master has been running on a tight schedule since yesterday and hasn’t had enough time for his studies.”\nSeon-ah's eyes darted nervously between Jin Hayeon and me.\nIt wasn't a pleasant situation for me.\nIn this madhouse of a Demonic Cult, the two things keeping me sane were my diary and this adorable kid. However, openly siding with Seon-ah would only exacerbate the tension between them.\n“Today, instead of learning anything new, I’m just going to review on my own. But I do have something for you to prepare, Miss Jin.”\n\"What would you like me to prepare?\"\n\"A mock interview.\"\n\"A mock interview, you say?\"\nJin Hayeon asked back as if she were hearing the term for the first time.\nI’m sure that she would have never heard of it.\n\"I want you to prepare a mock interview based on the material you've taught me over the past fortnight. It will serve as practice for the Hall of the Demonic Way entrance examination and help me identify any gaps in my knowledge.\"\nThe mock interview was not something I just thought of on the spot. I had been thinking for some time that it would be good to do it since the second week of my studies.\nFrom my long years as a student, I knew there were various memorization techniques.\nScientifically speaking, memorization is ultimately the process of converting short-term memory into long-term memory. And the most important thing for converting short-term memory into long-term memory is repetition.\nRepetition was key, but not just mindless repetition on the first day of learning.\nThe most efficient way is to revisit it once in a while when you're about to forget it.\nReview what you learned once that day, once the next day, once a week later, once a month later, once three months later, and once a year later.\nIn that sense, mock interviews or mock tests were quite important.\nThey allowed you to pinpoint weak areas and forgotten information without wasting time rereading already memorized content. It improved both test-taking skills and the efficiency of review.\nAnd for this, the quality of questions in the mock test was paramount.\n\"Please prepare questions that are likely to appear in the actual Hall of the Demonic Way entrance examination. Cover all the material we've covered in the past fortnight, leaving no gaps.\"\nAt my instructions, Jin Hayeon showed an expression of wonder uncharacteristic of her as if she hadn't expected me to think about such detailed matters.\n\"I plan to conduct mock interviews once every fortnight from now on. Ah, while we're doing mock interviews, it would be good to have Seon-ah participate as well. After all, Seon-ah is also studying the doctrines for the Hall of the Demonic Way entrance examination, isn't she?\" The source of thɪs content is NoveI-Fire.ɴet\nI turned to Seon-ah, \"Well then, shall we check tomorrow how well Seon-ah kept her promise?\"\nAt my words, Seon-ah gulped and her eyes trembled anxiously and after a moment of hesitation, Seon-ah suddenly broke free from my arms.\n\"I, I'll go study a bit more and come back.\" And with that, she scurried out of Windrock Palace.\nThe hairpin that wasn't properly fixed and swayed back and forth particularly caught my eye.\nIl-mok's daily routine pretty much stayed the same. The only special event was a mock interview we held.\nAs instructed, Jin Hayeon prepared a devilishly difficult set of questions, all of which Il-mok answered flawlessly.\n\"Wow! How do you remember all that, Big Brother?\"\nSeon-ah, who had been roped into participating, exclaimed in admiration.\nThat's not to say Seon-ah couldn't answer any questions at all.\nBeing the precious daughter of the Hyeokryeon Family, a prestigious family in the Demonic Cult, Seon-ah had already read the doctrine books several times. But she was still just a kid, so her knowledge was all based on memorizing stuff word-for-word.\nShe answered Jin Hayeon's questions with short, verbatim recitations from the texts.\nIn contrast, Il-mok's answers were eloquent and comprehensive. He effortlessly connected different passages, drawing parallels and employing various analogies.\n''...His request for a mock interview wasn't solely for Lady Seon-ah's benefit.’ Jin Hayeon realized, observing Il-mok with a newfound appreciation.\nShe couldn't believe he had actually memorized and understood every single thing they'd covered in the last two weeks, without missing a beat.\nShe recalled his insightful observations during their visit to Aksu County.\n'Perhaps Young Master Il-mok is truly a genius...'\nUnbeknownst to her, he was simply a man accustomed to studying. Regardless of her misconception, Il-mok's routine remained unchanged.\nHis martial arts training with Jin Hayeon was progressing smoothly, and he was starting to gain muscle. The same was true for the martial arts training with the Heavenly Demon.\nThanks to becoming accustomed to the lightness skill while traveling to and from Aksu, he had recently been engrossed in training to execute the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword in conjunction with them.\nHe spent his remaining time cultivating his internal energy through breathing exercises. After about fifteen days, his dantian, once the size of a grain of millet, had grown to the size of a bean.\n\"Now, it’s about the time to start training you in handling internal energy.\"\nThe news brought by the Heavenly Demon filled Il-mok with anticipation.\nBut before teaching him the martial arts right away, the Heavenly Demon preached the greatness of Demonic Arts.\n\"Haha. There's no need to be surprised; the amount of energy you have right now would’ve taken those hypocrites in the Central Plains a good two years to build up with their basic breathing exercises. Even with their so-called ‘Divine Arts,’ it would've taken them at least three months to gather that amount.\"\nAn absorption rate three times faster than the Central Plains' ultimate arts.\nBut Il-mok understood that this was a scam.\n‘Yeah, but you left out the part about the side effects.’\nOf course, he wisely kept his reservations to himself.\n\"Indeed! The Demonic Arts of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult are truly unparalleled, Master.\"\n\"Haha. You understand very well.\"\nPleased, the Heavenly Demon let out a hearty laugh and slowly drew his Heavenly Demon Sword.\nHe demonstrated the Soul-Departing Sword, which was both the first form of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword and a sword-drawing technique, while reciting its key principles. After sheathing his sword, he repeated the demonstration, this time explaining the principles in detail.\n“As you grab the sword with your right hand, you pull energy up from your dantian and channel it to your Qihai Acupoint. From there, the flow of energy…\"\nAs he completed his explanation in the time it took to draw his sword once more, Il-mok asked in a puzzled tone.\n\"Is, is that all?\"\nWhether it was the key principles themselves or their explanation, it seemed remarkably brief and simple.\n\"Hahaha. Demonic Arts value efficiency. Those self-proclaimed hypocrites make their manuals long and complicated, like some kind of secret code, because they’re paranoid someone will steal their moves. Our Demonic Arts are different. The same applies to the flow of internal energy. They use these ridiculously complex pathways, but we don’t bother.”\n\"Is there a reason the orthodox sects purposely use internal energy in such a difficult way?\"\n\"Because they are cowards. They’re trying to avoid all the dangerous meridian points, so of course their routes are going to be a convoluted mess.”\n\"Ah...\"\nSo basically, Demonic Arts just plows straight through the dangerous meridian points instead of going around them.\n'No wonder people call them crazy...'\nAs he was reminded of the danger of Demonic Arts, the Heavenly Demon told Il-mok, \"Since the key points are as simple as you said, you must have already memorized them all. Now try performing it yourself.\"\nIl-mok took several deep breaths to calm his nerves and placed his hand on the hilt of his sword.\n\"Since it's your first time, try to perform it slowly while recalling the key points.\"\nEven without the old man’s advice, Il-mok had planned to do so.\nSince it was said to pass through dangerous meridians, recklessly performing it could risk becoming crippled.\n\"Hup.\"\nAfter taking one last deep breath, Il-mok held his breath and slowly drew his sword.\nIn his head, he recalled the key points that the Heavenly Demon had taught him, and operated his internal energy according to the technique’s principles.\nZiiiing.\nTo his astonishment, despite the slow draw, a sharp ringing resonated from his sword as he completed the Soul-Departing Sword form.\nIt signified the immense power imbued within the movement.\nIl-mok stared at his vibrating sword in wonder and repeated the stance several times. However, his still-developing dantian quickly depleted.\n“Do a round of energy circulation. Let's start again after filling your dantian.\"\nFollowing the Heavenly Demon's instructions, he recovered his internal energy through circulation and performed the technique using his internal energy again several times.\nAs the principles were ingrained into his body, at some point, he was able to perform the technique at the same speed as when he usually swung his sword.\nWhiiing.\nAs the speed increased, Il-mok, who was looking at the sword that was emitting an even more resonant sound, soon frowned.\nThen with an uncomfortable expression, Il-mok turned his gaze and began looking around.\n\"What's wrong?\" the Heavenly Demon asked, puzzled.\n\"Um, my position seems a bit strange,\" Il-mok replied.\n\"Position?\"\nInstead of answering, Il-mok abruptly took a step to the right. \"Huu… This is the exact center of the Windrock Palace. Being slightly off-center was… uncomfortable…\"\nCold sweat ran down Il-mok's back as he suddenly stopped speaking.\n'Fuck.'\nIl-mok realized that the side effect of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword had begun.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 20 : Side Effect (2)",
    "content": "Chapter 20: Side Effect (2)\nThat night.\nAs usual, I was scribbling in my diary by lamplight in the corner of the room.\n—Damn it. I've been using side effect as an excuse with the old man, but I can't believe it's kicking in already.\nA moment later, I paused writing after jotting down the day's frustrations.\n'The handwriting... I don't like it.'\nTrying to write Hangul with a brush resulted in crooked, uneven strokes. I felt an overwhelming urge to rip up the page and start anew.\n—This goddamn side effect. Wait, since when did I care about handwriting?\nCome to think of it, I always had terrible handwriting regardless of the tools.\n—It’s not like anyone else is gonna read this! It’s my own private diary to complain in, so who cares what the writing looks like!\n— But it looks fucking weird! I want to tear it all up.\n— aslkdjf;laksjdf;lkajsdf\nThe last lines of my entry devolved into meaningless strokes of frustrated scribbling.\nAfter wrestling with my handwriting and venting my frustrations for a while...\n\"Oh?\"\nA sudden thought occurred to me.\n'Do I really need to stress myself out trying to ignore the side effect?'\nHonestly, the current side effect was just 'irritation-inducing' at most.\nIt was something I could ignore if I wanted to. That's why I was still writing in my diary despite being annoyed.\nHowever.\n—This is just gonna get way worse as I get stronger, isn't it?\nIf it’s just annoying now, it’s pretty obvious it’ll turn into full-blown OCD once I get better with the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\nThat said, I couldn't stop learning the Demonic Art now. My life literally depends on it.\nBut if I set that aside…\n— What’s so bad about being a perfectionist?\nThe only reason I'm stressed is because I'm thinking of it as a 'side effect.'\nSo… What if I embraced it and strived for perfection in everything?\n\"It might not be bad at all,\" I muttered, nodding to myself.\n\"Right. It's only a problem because I think of it as a side effect. Positive thinking. Yeah. Positivity is key.\"\nWith that little pep talk, I ripped the pages out of my diary.\nThen, like a master craftsman sewing each stitch with utmost care, I wrote my diary with all my heart.\nI meticulously rewrote the parts that didn't satisfy me. I put in the consonants and vowels one by one as if I were handling a treasure.\nBeads of sweat formed on my forehead from the intense concentration.\n\"Whew. That was close.\"\nI quickly wiped the sweat from my forehead while muttering. If the sweat had dripped down and smeared the ink, I would have had to rewrite everything. Again.\nHaving dodged that crisis, I returned to focusing intently on my diary.\nTime passed without my notice as I concentrated...\n\"Phew.\"\nFinishing writing everything I wanted to with satisfyingly precise characters, I let out a deep sigh.\nMy back and shoulders were aching from being so tense for so long.\n\"Time to get some sleep.\"\nBut somehow, my mind felt much more at ease.\nSometime later…\n\"Mmm.\"\nA sudden urge to use the bathroom woke me in the middle of the night.\n\"Sigh. The traditional-style bathroom is really inconvenient at night.\"\nIt's been over a year and that’s still the one thing I can't get used to here.\nAs I was getting up while grumbling about this, I suddenly froze.\nThe moon peeked through the clouds, casting a faint glow through the paper-covered window. But one corner of the room remained shrouded in darkness—a human-shaped shadow.\nAs I stood frozen, the figure's hidden face turned towards me.\nThe man, whose face was hidden in shadow, looked at me with his only visible eyes.\n\"You saw?\"\n\"......\"\nIt was the voice of my Third Brother Seo Wan-pyeong.\n'So, you've finally come to kill me.'\nA cold sweat ran down my spine.\nI was tongue-tied for a second, but I quickly forced myself to speak.\nThey say even in a tiger's den, you can survive if you keep your wits about you.\nRight now, the tiger had literally broken into my house.\nStill, doing something was better than doing nothing.\n\"What brings you here at this late hour, Third Brother?\"\n\"You don't seem pleased that I've come,\" he accused.\nI carefully answered while trying to hide my fear.\n\"How could that be? I'm overjoyed that my deeply respected Third Brother has come to visit. I was just surprised you’d come so late at night and not during the day.”\nWhile one part of my brain was ringing alarm bells about the threat to my life, lies flowed smoothly from my mouth.\n'I suppose this is an occupational hazard too.'\nYears of dealing with irate customers honed my ability to maintain a polite facade while internally cursing their entire lineage.\nPerhaps my flattery worked as his eyes turned crescents.\nIt meant he was smiling, though it seemed somewhat twisted.\n“I had to avoid the guards.”\n\"...I have guards?\"\nIs he talking about Jin Hayeon?\nWhile I pondered this, Third Brother's answer was unexpected.\n\"I'm not talking about your guards, but my own.\"\n\"...Are you saying you came at this late hour to avoid your own guards?\"\nThe fuck?\nWhile I swallowed those words, my crazy assassin of a Third Brother cleared up my confusion.\n\"That's right. My guards aren't there to protect me, but to protect those who might die by my hand.\"\n\"......\"\nSo, if he snuck past guards who are supposed to stop him from killing people… that means he’s here to kill me.\nCold sweat started pouring down my spine like a storm.\n'Should I scream?'\nNo, that would get my throat slit before Jin Hayeon could even arrive.\nCan I draw my sword and hold out until Jin Hayeon joins the fight?\nMy mind naturally went to the technique I learned today. The first form of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword is a move specialized in blocking an enemy’s attack while dishing swift counterattacks.\nThanks to Master's teachings, my sword was always within reach, right beside my bed. But…\n'Can I block an attack from this crazy fucker?'\nThe difference between me, who had just entered the Tainted stage, and the senior brother, who had reached the Extremity stage, was insurmountable.\nMy instinct screamed in protest.\nWhile I was trying to find a way to survive by racking my brains...\nFor some reason, the crazy fucker spoke again.\n\"It's always been like this. Master seems to find me untrustworthy. I suppose I'm too inadequate to be the Heavenly Demon's disciple. But you… you're different.\"\n\"M-me?\"\n\"Yes. I heard Master recently issued new instructions to all branches. About creating a school, I believe. And Master proudly said that the idea came from you.\"\n\"......\"\nSo…\nMaster bragged about me, and my paranoid senior brother, consumed by jealousy, had come to kill me.\n‘This is the most fucked-up butterfly effect in history!!!!!’\nI felt like I was going crazy from the injustice.\nRight at that moment.\nHis right arm extended towards me.\n'He's going to kill me!'\nBut I couldn't just accept death like this.\nI quickly moved my arm to grab the scabbard beside my bed, but my senior brother's movement of extending his right hand was much faster than my attempt to draw the sword.\nBut instead of a sword, he held… crumpled pieces of paper.\n\"???\"\nWhile my mind was filled with confusion, he spoke, “That’s why I came. I was curious. I wanted to see what the difference was between me and the little brother our Master is so proud of. I had to sneak here because if I just walked over, my guards might say something weird to the Master. I can’t disappoint him again.”\n\"I-is that so?\"\n\"And when I came in, I found these papers on the floor. I tried to see what Master's proud youngest disciple had written before falling asleep, but it was writing I couldn't read.\"\nOnly then did I realize what those paper scraps were.\n‘My torn-up diary pages!’\nI was so focused on writing a new page that I forgot about the torn pages.\nI guess since I’m only at the first stage of the Demonic Art, my OCD only kicks in for specific things. I hadn't yet reached the point of pathological cleaning, so I left it as it was and fell asleep.\n\"Can you tell me what is written here?\"\nI repeated the same excuse I'd given to Jin Hayeon.\n\"To study the teachings in such a way. It's a method I never would have thought of. Indeed, you are completely different from someone like me. Well, I suppose I'm the one who's useless.\" The source of this content ɪs novel·fire·net\nSensing imminent danger, I quickly interjected, \"Useless? What are you saying, Third Brother! How could you, the person I respect the second most, say such a thing!\"\n\"You respect me second most?\"\n\"That's right. Except for our great Master, you are the person I respect most!\"\nHis teeth flashed again in the shadows, but the smile quickly vanished, replaced by a gloomy voice. “Respect a guy like me? You’re making fun of me.”\nHis words were laced with thorns.\n'The side effect of the Shadowless Fourteen Moves has shattered his self-esteem.'\nThen, if I could boost his self-esteem, wouldn't he leave without killing me?\nIt might seem like a far-fetched idea, but it was better than giving up without trying anything.\nThey say that money can even make a ghost dance, so maybe praises can make a psychopath dance?\n\"I heard Third Brother entered and graduated from the Hall of the Demonic Way as the top student. I'm just someone who's not even sure if I can enter the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\n“As Master’s favored disciple, you'll surely enter as the top student. Besides, Eldest Brother and Sixth Brother also achieved top rank.\"\n\"M-Master told me! He told me how much faith he has in you, Third Brother!\"\n\"Master said such things?\"\nThe gloomy senior brother finally showed a reaction at the mention of Master.\n“It was something he told me in passing, asking me never to tell the other senior brothers. It seems Master doesn't directly praise us or others to prevent us from becoming arrogant. I've never received praise from Master during training either.\"\nThis was a blatant lie, but I spoke with unwavering confidence.\n“I've always worried that I'm far too inadequate compared to Master and my senior brothers.\"\n\"A bright disciple like you worried about such things?\"\n\"Me, clever? I'm always getting scolded by Master. And while scolding me, Master always told me to learn from Third Brother.\"\n\"...Master said such things?\"\nHis lips twitched in the shadows. He was wavering.\nSeizing the opportunity, I continued my relentless praise.\n\"That's right, Senior Brother! Shadowless Fourteen Moves is truly the world's greatest assassination art. Master said that just your existence puts his mind at ease, as you could handle even the Leader of the Murim Alliance if you wished!\"\n“And you’re so tall and handsome, I’m super jealous! When I grow up, I want to be just like you! Hahaha.”\nCountless amounts of rainbow farts poured from my mouth for a long time.\n\"Hahaha! I never imagined Master and my youngest brother held me in such high regard. I always thought they looked down on me as a gloomy fellow.\"\n\"Ahahaha. Y-You're mistaken, senior brother. How could I ever think of you like that?\"\nFinally, Third Brother broke into a bright smile.\nHe nodded in satisfaction, then tilted his head and asked.\n\"By the way, youngest brother.\"\n\"Yes, senior brother.\"\n\"Why are you holding your sword?\"\n\"......\"",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 21 : Side Effect (3)",
    "content": "Chapter 21: Side Effect (3)\nOh, fuck.\nI was so focused on flattering him that I forgot I was still holding my sword.\n\"Th-that is...\"\nI hesitated for just a second, but in that time, my senior brother’s happy face went ice-cold.\nIf I didn't say something, he was probably going to kill me for messing with him.\nAs my mind went blank from that ominous feeling, I blurted out the first excuse that came to mind.\n\"Th-there was a mosquito, senior brother!\"\n\"A mosquito?\"\n\"Yes! I grabbed my sword to kill the mosquito.\"\n\"You kill mosquitoes with a sword?\"\n\"Y-Yes! It's training to accurately strike even the smallest of targets. Master told me that your Shadowless Fourteen Moves are so precise that you can sever a single strand of hair in mid-air. He instructed me to follow your example.\"\n\"Hahaha. Master said that too?\"\n\"Y-yes, senior brother!\"\nThird Brother’s cold melted into a smile. And it’s a smile that reached his eyes.\nJust as I was breathing a sigh of relief inwardly...\nSlash.\nA chilling sound grazed my ear.\n\"...\"\nMy body completely froze, and as I slightly turned my eyes to the side, a mosquito that had been sliced in half was lying on the floor.\n\"Did you see that? I demonstrated the first stance of the Shadowless Fourteen Moves for you. Reflect on your Senior Brother's swordsmanship and strive for such precision.\" His inflated ego had transformed him into a model mentor.\nBut.\n'What was I supposed to see? I couldn't even see it, let alone imitate it.'\nEven now, my heart was pounding.\n'Good thing I didn't scream...'\nThat single strike made me realize something.\nAt my current level, my eyes couldn’t even follow the trajectory of his sword, let alone block it.\nThe moment Third Brother decided to kill me, my head would roll off before I even realized I was dead.\nPerhaps the monotony of my daily life had dulled my senses.\nI had forgotten how many monstrous beings resided within this cult filled with madmen and fanatics alike.\nAs I was reflecting on this sobering realization, senior brother said, \"Thanks to you, youngest, I've had a pleasant time. I’ll stop by more often.”\n\"Y-you're welcome to visit anytime, senior brother.\"\n\"Indeed. It's late now, so go to sleep.\"\nAstonishingly, by the time he finished his sentence, he had vanished from the room.\n'...Fuck. How am I supposed to sleep when my heart is still pounding?'\nBut I didn’t dare say it out loud. With a psycho like him, you never know if he's still hiding somewhere watching.\nThe next day, around lunchtime.\nAfter sorting out some of the cult's morning paperwork, the Heavenly Demon headed over to the Black Cloud Pavilion where his third disciple resided.\nWhile he visited his youngest every evening for instruction, he didn't extend the same courtesy to his other disciples. The position of Heavenly Demon demanded much of his time, and in the case of his first and third disciples, there was little left for him to teach.\nOnce a practitioner of Demonic Art reached the Extremity, one could only overcome their limits through their own enlightenment. That’s why his interactions with them were limited to occasional visits and brief conversations.\n“Master.”\n\"How’s the work at the Dark Shadow Pavilion coming along?”\nAs was common with older generations, his idea of 'light conversation' revolved around work. Check latest chapters at novel•ﬁre.net\n\"Have you made any progress with the Shadowless Fourteen Moves?\"\nOr training and studies.\nWhile benevolent towards his followers and lower-ranking members, the Heavenly Demon was undeniably a boomer.\nThey chatted like that for a bit, same as always.\nThen the Heavenly Demon stroked his beard and asked something different. \"Hmm. Wan-pyeong, has something pleasant happened recently?\"\nIt was the same Seo Wan-pyeong as always, with a gloomy expression and deep shadows on his face. But the Heavenly Demon, who had spent over twenty years with his disciple, could tell that Seo Wan-pyeong was currently in quite a good mood.\n‘It reminded me of the time when he had barely learned his Demonic Art.’\nYears of negativity had etched a perpetual frown onto his face, but Seo Wan-pyeong had once been capable of genuine smiles.\nThe gloomy man had now confirmed the words of his junior brother and banished his doubt.\n'Master has been watching over me! Just as the youngest said.'\nHis self-esteem, which had been shattered due to his paranoia, recovered slightly.\nIt meant even more because it was attention from none other than the great Heavenly Demon, his Master.\nHe wanted to share his conversation with Il-mok, but then he remembered something crucial.\n'Right! The youngest said that Master is strict in front of his disciples but praises them behind their backs.'\nIf that was the case, there was no need to tell Master about yesterday's conversation with the youngest.\n\"Ahem. It's just that the weather is so nice today, I simply feel good. Master.\"\n\"Oh? That's a very positive sign. It might mean you’re about to have a breakthrough with your martial arts.”\nShadowless Fourteen Moves caused one to suffer from negativity and paranoia, especially as one delved deeper into the Extremity stage.\nFor his third disciple to be cheerful because of the good weather…\nThe Heavenly Demon let out a hearty laugh, something Seo Wan-pyeong hadn't heard in a long time. Seo Wan-pyeong's lips twitched uncontrollably.\n'Master is proud of me!'\nSeo Wan-pyeong, whose mood had improved tremendously for the first time in a long while, wondered how he could please Master even more.\nHow could he make Master even prouder of him?\nAs he pondered this, he recalled the conversation he had with Il-mok last night.\n'Right! Master said my Shadowless Fourteen Moves was so excellent that it could precisely cut even the tiniest objects!'\nAn idea sparked in Seo Wan-pyeong's mind. He twisted his lips into a rare smile.\n\"Master!\"\n\"Yes, Third Disciple.\"\nWith uncharacteristic enthusiasm, Seo Wan-pyeong called out to his master. As the Heavenly Demon looked at him, he…\nPop!\nHe suddenly pulled out a clump of his own hair. He released his grip, letting the strands float in the air.\nSwish!\nA delayed slicing sound followed the silent, invisible flash of his sword. The scattered hairs lay on the floor, each meticulously divided into dozens of pieces. The speed and precision with which he had severed the fine hairs mid-air were beyond the perception of ordinary individuals.\nAfter showing off, Seo Wan-pyeong looked at his master like a dog asking to be praised.\nAnd the Heavenly Demon, after watching his poor disciple's little stunt from start to finish…\n\"...\"\n…just stared at him with a look that screamed, “What the hell is wrong with my kid?”\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nAn awkward silence hung in the air.\nPop.\nSlash!\nThinking he hadn't done enough, Seo Wan-pyeong ripped out another clump of hair, scattering and slicing it in mid-air. He continued this self-inflicted hair-cutting frenzy for some time.\nThe Heavenly Demon watched that madness in a daze for a while before muttering with a bitter tone.\n\"Ahem. Ah, excellent skills.\"\n\"Hahaha. Thank you, Master! I will continue to work hard!\"\nFinally hearing the praise he wanted, Seo Wan-pyeong grinned, completely forgetting the pain of ripping out his own hair.\n\"Y-yes. Continue to work hard.\"\n\"Yes! I will perfect the Shadowless Fourteen Moves and bring you the head of the Murim Alliance Leader!\"\n\" Cough . Yes. I will put my faith in you.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon responded to Seo Wan-pyeong's words with a complicated expression. He quickly left the Black Cloud Pavilion, citing that he had urgent business.\n‘It seems he hasn't broken through the Extremity barrier but has fallen into a state of Qi Deviation,' The Heavenly Demon wondered if his poor third disciple might have finally gone mad.\n'There's no choice. I'll have to increase the guards for the Third Disciple.'\nNot for Seo Wan-pyeong’s safety, but just in case he went berserk.\nAfter receiving an unexpected night visitor, I gained a very important concern.\nMore precisely, a problem I'd been trying to ignore resurfaced.\n'I need to take precautions.'\nIt wasn't a concern about the entrance exam for the Hall of the Demonic Way.\n'Otherwise, I might end up like that crazy senior brother.'\nThe condition of the Third Brother who had visited a few days ago was far from normal. However, considering what kind of place this fucking cult is, I wondered how many people could even tell.\n'I've gotten too used to it.'\nI had become complacent, accepting the bizarre as normal.\nIn particular, the side effect of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword that I was learning had similarities to those of Third Brother.\nIt posed a high risk to my self-esteem.\nI recalled something I had heard in my past life as Seo Ji-hoon.\nMany successful artists, entrepreneurs, and film directors were perfectionists. And this perfectionism often came at a steep price—immense stress.\nWhile perfectionism fueled their ambitions and achievements, leading to great success and the creation of masterpieces, that very thing was also the cause of their downfall.\nThe pursuit of unattainable perfection could lead to self-loathing and a crippling sense of inadequacy.\nWhen that happens, perfectionists would come to view themselves as insects or trash for failing to achieve their goals.\nIn other words, instead of becoming a successful businessman, film director, or artist who was a perfectionist...\nI could become a self-loathing madman like Third Brother.\nTo avoid such a situation, I needed to prepare something.\nA way to avoid fixating on the impossible.\nThe only problem was...\n‘Why the hell am I thinking about this in the middle of the night?’\n\"Sigh. I truly am trash, youngest brother. Master doesn’t trust me. That has to be why he assigned me more guards.”\nI sighed internally and replied, \"On the contrary, senior brother, it's because he trusts you. You vowed to kill the Murim Alliance Leader, didn't you? Your skills are specialized in assassination. This is likely Master's way of providing you with training in infiltration.\"\n“I see! If I can't even evade a mere fifteen guards, how can I hope to reach the heavily guarded Alliance Leader? Master's wisdom is profound! I was foolish to misinterpret his intentions. I'm truly a worthless wretch.\"\nAs senior brother began digging another hole, I spoke.\n\"Nonsense, senior brother! It's human nature to be oblivious to one's own flaws while easily recognizing those of others. Isn't that how romance works too?\"\n“I have no experience in romantic relationships. As expected, my young brother must have been popular since childhood.”\nFor fuck’s sake, this one is also a landmine.\n\"I-I too only heard about it. Besides, people naturally excel in different areas. While I might be good at understanding people's inner thoughts, you excel at… dissecting them. Even if I trained until I reached your age, it would be impossible for me to assassinate the Alliance Leader.\"\n\"Haa… You're right, junior brother. You truly are remarkable. After speaking with you, my mind feels at ease, and the demonic energy that plagues me recedes. I’m going to stop by whenever I’m feeling down from now on.”\nHearing his answer, I could only force out a smile while laughing bitterly.\n\"Hahaha. You're always welcome, but could you possibly visit during the day?\"\nAt this rate, I wouldn't go mad from my Demonic Art's side effect, but from sheer sleep deprivation.",

    "novel_title": "So, Did Someone Force You to Become the Heavenly Demon",
    "chapter_number": "Chapter 22 : Short Fuse (1)",
    "content": "Chapter 22: Short Fuse (1)\nNearly two months have already passed since I was dragged into this godforsaken cult.\nThanks to that, I've already finished reading through the Secret Record of the Heavenly Demon and recently I've been studying their historical records.\nAnyone who has experience with intense studying, whether as a student or while preparing for exams, probably knows this:\nEven within the same field of study, the methods vary depending on the subject or focus.\nAs both a scripture and a doctrine, the Secret Record of the Heavenly Demon demanded not just memorization, but also understanding.\nTo be precise, I needed to know the way those lunatics’ brain works. Understanding their deranged way of thinking came as an unwanted bonus.\nHowever, the historical records I'm currently studying, and the law books I'll soon learn, were slightly different. While some understanding was necessary, they required much more simple memorization.\nBut I wasn't worried.\n‘If it’s just memorization, this is basically the civil service exam all over again.’\nI’d already crammed Korean history and a bunch of administrative law for that thing, and this was pretty much the same deal.\nThanks to years of being a student and then an exam prepper, I had a whole arsenal of memorization tricks.\nEverything from memory palaces and visualization to the good old-fashioned acronym method I used back in high school.\nMost high school students in South Korea would probably have used the simple acronym method.\nLiberal arts students used acronyms to memorize the Joseon Dynasty kings, while science students used them for the periodic table.\n'Ah, I heard they don't separate liberal arts and sciences anymore these days?'\nI chuckled at my outdated thinking and shook my head.\nEither way, since I was already sick and tired of memorization, the 'studying' part was progressing smoothly without any particular issues.\nSo how about martial arts?\n'Never thought I'd have a body like this in my lifetime.'\nThanks to having been put through the wringer by Jin Hayeon for two months, muscles were finally starting to show.\nIt was truly remarkable.\nI'd heard somewhere that it takes at least half a year to really see exercise results and build muscle, yet here I was already showing visible changes.\n'Is this what they call overwhelming talent?'\nI could understand why Master had been so eager to force me to be his disciple.\nMy internal energy had also grown considerably.\nI was now at a level where if I controlled my output appropriately, I could sustain my technique rotation for roughly half an hour.\nSince I’d memorized all the moves and energy control for the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, so lately we’d moved on to a new kind of training.\nClang!\nUsing the Soul-Departing Sword, I use my sword to block Jin Hayeon’s palm strike.\nA cold energy gradually penetrated through her palm where it met my sword.\nSince my internal energy couldn't yet withstand that force, I stepped back once using lightness skill while deflecting her hand away.\nAs if reading my movements, she stepped forward in response and struck again, but this time, with her left hand.\nThis time, instead of blocking her attack, I countered by thrusting my sword toward her heart.\n‘A sword has greater reach than a hand!’\nAnd as expected of a graduate from the Hall of the Demonic Way, Jin Hayeon adeptly adjusted her attacking left hand in an attempt to seize my sword by coating her fingers with her Demonic Art.\nKnowing the nature of her Demonic Art, I retracted my sword slightly, just barely enough to avoid her grasp, then…\nShhhwing!\nI thrust again in a different direction.\nThis was something I'd learned after several sparring matches with her.\nThe sword is a great weapon for both thrusting and slashing techniques. While inherently having a shorter reach than the spear, it offered a greater reach advantage against unarmed opponents. Against a martial master like Jin Hayeon, who had mastered ice-attributed Demonic Art, swift and rapid thrusts were more effective than powerful slashes.\nSwoosh!\nClang!\nA barrage of swift and accurate thrusts assaulted her and Jin Hayeon either deflected or dodged my attacks with minimal movement while constantly looking for a gap in my movements.\nSweat dripped down from my forehead as I focused on regulating my breath and energy circulation while maintaining my attacks.\nIn that split second when a drop of sweat fell and blocked my right eye...\nPat!\n\"!!!\"\nShe had instantly moved to my blind spot and was already striking toward my abdomen with her right hand.\nClang!! Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on nοvelfire.net\n\"Ugh...\"\nEven though I managed to block the attack, my stance crumbled, forcing me back two steps.\n\"Control your internal energy, Young Master. You risk internal injury.\"\nEven without her reminder, I immediately sat cross-legged and began to regulate my energy circulation.\nShe must have pulled her punch at the last second, because I wasn’t seriously hurt. It didn’t take long to get my energy back under control.\n\"Whew.\"\n“You have become more proficient in executing the Soul-Cutting Flash and Soul-Capturing Sword, Young Master.”\nAs if she had not a single shred of concern for my injuries, she began the post-spar review the moment I opened my eyes.\nSoul-Cutting Flash and Soul-Capturing Sword, the fourth and eleventh forms of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, were the thrusting techniques I had been using.\nThough I had been thrusting at various angles, in essence, I had only been using these two forms.\nFundamentally, all forms of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword all worked that way. All of them contained basic forms and movements that served as the foundations of the technique and can be applied in various ways.\nAs expected from an aspiring psychopath, she opened her analysis with praises before raining me down with criticism and coldly listed my faults.\n\"However, you're relying too heavily on just those two forms. While thrusting is effective against my Demonic Art, limiting your options to those two techniques causes you to become too predictable. You need to expand your repertoire.”\n\"I'll keep that in mind.\"\n\"Also, it's disappointing that you lost track of me at the end when your vision was blocked by sweat. You were born with excellent eyes and reflexes, Young Master, so you have the bad habit of relying on visual cues from your opponent. You should always be predicting your opponent's next move.\"\n\"I-I see.\"\n\"Lastly, you're too cautious. If you had aimed for my neck with your sword instead of blocking my strike at the end, you might not have won, but you could have achieved a draw.\"\n\"...\"\nShe had an exceptional talent for grinding people down.\n'If Third Brother had been taught by Jin Hayeon in his childhood, he might have hanged himself long ago.'\nTruly, a highly competent aspiring psychopath.\n\"Me too! I want to try!\"\nLittle Seon-ah, now much more cheerful, chimed in, waving her hand excitedly.\nThis was supposed to be our designated break time, a time for Seon-ah and me to relax.\nHowever, thanks to a certain ice block who disapproved our leisurely time, it had transformed into a joint study and training session.\nWe sparred, reviewed our morning studies, and so on.\n\"Here I come!!\"\nSeon-ah shouted and instantly closed the distance between us using her lightness skill. Her fingernails glowed crimson as she coated them with her energy.\nThe redness in her hair and eyes seemed to be a manifestation of the Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art she was practicing.\nClang!\nThe moment her energy-infused nails clashed with my sword, a metallic sound of metal colliding against metal rang out.\nSparring with Seon-ah was also very helpful for me.\nUnlike Jin Hayeon who used minimal and precise movements that were imbued with cold energy, Seon-ah's Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art boasted sharp and unpredictable forms, requiring me to use a different approach to face her.\nMoreover, unlike Jin Hayeon who was far more skilled than me, Seon-ah's level wasn't too far from mine.\nSince Seon-ah had been learning the Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art for over a year, she had the advantage in internal energy and forms.\nClang!!\nHowever, with a three-year age gap during the crucial growth period, I had far superior physical abilities.\n'Since Seon-ah is learning claw art, maintaining distance with thrusts should be effective, but...'\nAfter a brief exchange of strikes, I decided to implement Jin Hayeon's advice.\nJust as Seon-ah was getting used to my pattern, I abruptly changed the trajectory of my strike and executing a horizontal slash.\nClang!!\nShe managed to block my surprise attack, but the force of the blow sent her flying backward.\nThud!\nShe landed gracefully like a cat, but she was clearly on the defensive now.\n\"Hahaha. As expected of the youngest brother, you learn quickly and manage to incorporate Miss Jin’s advice at once.”\nJust then, a familiar voice reached my ears.\nWhen I turned my head, Third Brother was standing there since who knows how long.\n\"Greetings, Third Brother.\"\nAs I bowed, a disturbing thought occurred to me. 'He knew about Jin Hayeon's advice… which means he was here the whole time?'\nHe was truly a senior brother with an incredibly lacking presence.\nAnd that presence-lacking senior brother showed a twisted smile that I now recognized as genuine happiness.\n\"Haha. It's beneficial for you to spar with various opponents, youngest brother. Since both Miss Jin and the Young Lady of the Hyeokryeon Family practice close-combat martial arts, how about facing an opponent who uses a sword this time?”\n\"A sword... Are you offering to spar with me, Senior Brother?\"\nHe nodded at my question.\n\"To think that my most respected senior brother would spar with me, I'm truly honored!\"\nMy rainbow fart is truly effective on Third Brother as he let out a hearty laugh that didn’t suit his gloomy appearance.\n“Hahahaha! Oh, it’s not that big of an honor.”\nThird Brother was in an exceptionally good mood.\nSeon-ah pouted, probably because her playtime with me had been taken away and Jin Hayeon remained impassive with her usual expressionless face.\n'...Somehow, I feel like the number of people keeps growing.'\nI had an ominous feeling that it wouldn't stop here.\nLate that night, in a secluded corner of the vast Heavenly Demon Divine Cult compound, three figures met under the cover of darkness, their faces hidden by the shadows cast by the clouded moon.\nThey exchanged information about the cult's affairs.\nThen, the man on the left brought up information about Il-mok.\n\"Speaking of which, I've been hearing quite a bit about the youngest disciple that Heavenly Demon recently took in.\"\n\"Hmm. I heard that the idea for the school program that the Heavenly Demon is pushing forward also came from that youngest disciple's mouth.\"\n\"Tsk. That youngster is doing unnecessary things.\"\nHe was the kind of old-fashioned man who believed that uneducated commoners should just focus on their livelihoods and bring offerings of money or food. Educating them would only make them harder to control.\n\"How about we clean up that youngest disciple before he does more unnecessary things?\"\nThere were countless ways to kill him such as disguising his death as an accident, inducing him into the state of Qi Deviation, or setting up a trap by leaking his information to the unbelievers of the Central Plains.\nHowever, the man seated in the central position shook his head at the suggestion from the man on the right.\n“The Heavenly Demon has lived for over a hundred years. The day of his ascension isn’t that far off. There's no need to take such risks.\"\nNo matter how high the realm the current Heavenly Demon, Hyeokryeon Il-hwi, had reached by mastering even the Heavenly Demon Divine Arts, and maintained a young appearance compared to his actual age, he could not do anything about his natural lifespan.\nHistory has proven this time and again. While Hyeokryeon Il-hwi had reached an exceptional level of mastery, he wasn't the first in history to do so.\n\"He has ten years at most. And in ten years, the only obstacle to our claim on the leadership will be his First Disciple, Wi Jin-hak.\"\nThough Seo Wan-pyeong had reached the next highest level after Wi Jin-hak, he was nothing compared to those gathered here.\nFrom their perspective, Seo Wan-pyeong was still just a youngster struggling in the Extremity stage.\nWi Jin-hak, however, was nearing Transcendence. He posed a threat, but…\n\"Even if Wi Jin-hak achieves Transcendence, there's no need to worry. He's dull-witted. We can easily manipulate him.\" The man in the center spoke with absolute confidence. The others nodded in agreement.\nThen, the man on the left asked, \"But what if, in those ten years, the youngest one sides with Wi Jin-hak instead of forging his own path? He seems quite clever.\"\nA sinister smile spread across the face of the man in the center, his teeth flashing white in the shadows. \"Then, we'll simply have to take a slight risk and eliminate him before he grows stronger.\"",

    "content": "Chapter 23: Short Fuse (2)\nAround noon the following day.\nSeo Wan-pyeong was strolling through the grounds of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult with a gloomy expression. Sunlight fell across his gaunt face—pale from chronic insomnia, worsened by his paranoid delusions, and further drained by the nature of his martial arts, which leaned heavily on assassination. Seo Wan-pyeong winced, irritably raising a hand to shield his eyes from the intrusive rays. Yet…\n'What pleasant weather.' Read full story at novel_fіre.net\nDespite his grim exterior, his mood was uncharacteristically calm. The recent improvement in his mood was undoubtedly due to Il-mok's influence. Whenever he started spiraling—getting lost in dark thoughts, beating himself up for messing up a job, or blaming himself for every little thing that went wrong at the Dark Shadow Pavilion—he’d go find his youngest brother.\nThe boy was extraordinary. He would come up with solutions that Seo Wan-pyeong couldn't easily think of, or repeatedly remind him that he had misinterpreted their Master's words. Recently, Seo Wan-pyeong had even started to entertain the positive thought that perhaps their Master didn't hate him.\nHe’d had moments where he felt like a complete moron for needing help from a kid so much younger than him, but...\n\"What are you saying, senior brother?! I’ve witnessed your incredible sword skills firsthand, and you’ve even granted me the honor of sparring with you! What I'm doing is nothing compared to the favor you've shown me!\"\nAfter hearing that from him yesterday, those thoughts were gone entirely.\nAnd so, today too, Seo Wan-pyeong was heading to Windrock Palace as well. Not because he was feeling down, but because he genuinely wanted to go spar with the kid and teach him a few things.\nAs he was strolling through the cult's grounds, Seo Wan-pyeong's eyes caught sight of a familiar man.\n\"Greetings, Eldest Brother.\"\nWi Jin-hak, who had been pacing back and forth in the same spot like an anxious puppy, burst into a booming laugh at Seo Wan-pyeong's greeting.\n\"Hahaha! It's been a while since we've met like this in broad daylight, Third Brother.\"\nHis paranoia reared its ugly head and automatically translated his Eldest Brother’s words as, 'What's a gloomy guy like you doing in broad daylight?' But he quickly shook his head, forcing the negative thought away. It was probably just him.\n'I should ask the youngest about this.'\nPutting it aside, Seo Wan-pyeong asked his fellow disciple, \"Is something troubling you, Eldest Brother?\"\n\"There's a small problem with the Red Dragon Corps, and I'm pondering how to handle it. Hahaha.\"\nSeo Wan-pyeong nodded at Wi Jin-hak's answer. \"I see.\"\nJust as Seo Wan-pyeong belonged to the Dark Shadow Pavilion and handled the cult's affairs, his Eldest Brother was part of the Red Dragon Corps. The difference was that while Seo Wan-pyeong was a mid-level official in the Dark Shadow Pavilion, Wi Jin-hak was the leader of the Red Dragon Corps.\n“Honestly, leading the troops and crushing the skulls of those non-believer bastards is easy, but this situation is a bit complicated, so I’m scratching my head over it.”\nAn idea struck Seo Wan-pyeong as he watched his fellow disciple bursted into another bout of hearty laughter.\n\"Then, would you like to come with me?\"\n“Join you? Where to?”\n“I don’t know the specifics of your trouble, but there’s someone who might offer wise counsel.”\n\"Oh ho! Now that sounds interesting!\"\nWithout even asking who, Wi Jin-hak laughed like a fool and followed his junior brother.\nJust like any other day, I was spending time with Seon-ahh and Jin Hayeon when—\nClunk.\nThe doors of Windrock Palace swung open, revealing two unexpected guests. Recognizing them, I quickly clasped my hands in formal greeting.\n\"Greetings to Eldest Brother and Third Brother.\"\nI was being polite on the outside, but my brain was going a mile a minute.\n'I can understand the paranoid senior brother coming every day now, but what brings the ticking bomb one here?'\nAs if reading my thoughts, the ever-paranoid Third Brother graciously clarified.\n\"Good to see you, youngest. Actually, I met the Eldest Brother on the way here, and hearing he had a concern, we came together.\"\n\"I see that's what happened.\"\nWhile I responded reflexively, inwardly I was dumbfounded.\n‘No, really, why would you bring a ticking time bomb to me for advice?’\nEldest Brother was notorious for his volatile temper due to practicing the Raging Demon Sword Art. While rumors suggested he was nearing Transcendence, the crucial point was that he wasn't there yet. In other words, one wrong phrase could detonate him.\nBut unaware of my inner thoughts, the paranoid senior brother suddenly said to the ticking time bomb,\n\"Eldest Brother, as you've probably already heard, our youngest here is quite brilliant for his age. Perhaps he might be able to solve your problem, so why don't you explain it to him?\"\n\"Hahaha! Now that you mention it, Master did praise his wit! Well then, I'll explain.\"\nWith those words, Eldest Brother began to share his concerns without even asking for my opinion.\n\"Recently, the Vice Leader of our Red Dragon Corps was recognized for his achievements and promoted to become the leader of the Black Tiger Corps. The problem is, instead of bringing in a Vice Leader from elsewhere, Master told me to choose one myself. I have to pick the new guy myself from one of my current Squad Leaders.”\nOkay, that was definitely a tricky problem.\n'Having to promote just one out of many, huh. That's problematic in many ways.'\nHe must have been really stewing over it, because he just kept talking. \"They each have their strengths and weaknesses, and since we've been together for so long, it's even more difficult. All the current squad leaders have been with the Red Dragon Corps since I first joined as Vice Leader. One has good skills but is too slippery, another is...\"\nHe went on and on, ticking off the candidates on his fingers, and after what felt like an eternity, he finally wrapped it up. \"Given this situation, what do you think would be best, youngest?\"\nI furrowed my brow, feigning deep thought.\nMisinterpreting my silence, Seo Wan-pyeong encouraged me, \"Just be honest. Even though Eldest Brother looks a bit intimidating, he’s a great man who listens to what people have to say.\"\n\"!!!\"\nI couldn't help but flinch at the Third Brother's fanning of the flames.\nDid he just insult the living bomb just now?!\nTo my relief, Eldest Brother simply bellowed out a laugh. “Ahahaha! Yeah, I get that a lot! My face scares plenty of people!”\n‘Okay, so looks are a safe topic. Good to know.’\nBut I wasn’t out of the woods yet, so I opened my mouth as cautiously as possible.\n\"I've thought hard about it, but honestly, I'm not sure either.\"\nIn truth, I’d decided this the moment they arrived.\n‘Helping out here will only get me saddled with more work. No thanks.’\nWhether it’s here or in modern-day Korea, it’s the same. Do a good job and you’ll saddled with more work so I chose to feign ignorance instead.\nBetween Master’s demands and Third Brother’s clinginess, I refused to volunteer for another headache.\nThe only risk was triggering Eldest Brother’s rage, but to my surprise, it was Third Brother who frowned bitterly—not the ticking time bomb.\n'Why are you the one looking disappointed?'\nMeanwhile, the actual guy with the problem wasn’t mad at all. He was just grinning his usual goofy grin.\n\"Hahaha! So even my youngest brother found this to be a difficult problem, I see.\"\nAnd for some odd reason, the previously disappointed Third Brother even started to apologize on my behalf.\n\"Ahem. I'm sorry, Eldest Brother.\"\n“Hahaha. What’ve you got to be sorry for? It’s my fault for being too dumb to figure it out.”\nAs Eldest Brother laughed boisterously, he turned his head to survey the surroundings and his eyes met with Seon-ahh's.\n\"Oh ho! If it isn't the little miss from the Hyeokryeon Family! I've heard you've been visiting our youngest brother quite often lately.\"\n\"I'm not little,\" Seon-ahh replied with an uncharacteristically pouty tone.\n\"Ahahaha! It seems the little miss is upset because this stupid older brother has stolen away her playtime with the youngest! Hahaha! What a cute little lady.\"\nMaybe she was embarrassed he’d figured her out, or maybe she was just really ticked off.\nSeon-ahh pouted and grumbled under her breath.\n\"Lord Wi is a dummy.\"\nThe moment Seon-ahh blurted out those words...\n\"Ahahahaha!\"\nA strange, inexplicable sensation came over me. Elder Brother’s laughter boomed like an idiot as usual, but I felt a chill run down my spine.\nThen, Third Brother’s frantic voice transmission pierced my ear.\n―Oh no! RUN. NOW!\n\"???\"\nAs I shot the Third Brother a confused face, another voice transmission flew in.\n―There is a reason why the Eldest Brother was only said to nearly achieve Transcendence! While he is no longer as volatile as his early days, he cannot tolerate being called stupid. It’s fine if he calls himself stupid, but others must NEVER call him stupid!\n\"...\"\nWhat the fuck is this?\nIt's okay for him to call himself stupid, but if someone else says it, he loses his mind? Fucking nutjob.\n'That's right. This place was a den of lunatics.'\nEven as I was processing this important fact...\n\"Ahahahaha! Did you just call me an idiot?\"\nEldest Brother’s harsh laughter was getting louder and louder, and at the same time, violent energy waves began to erupt outwards from him.\nAnd they were directed towards Seon-ah, who had provoked him.\nOf course, Seon-ah was the precious daughter of the Hyeokryeon Family, a prestigious family even within the Demonic Cult. Even for the Eldest Brother, harming Seon-ah could cause problems. But if he were the type to consider such things before acting, he wouldn't have had an anger management issue in the first place.\nAs his maddened laughter grew louder, a gale of crimson and violent energy erupted from Eldest Brother’s body and lashed out at Seon-ahh.\nThird Brother and Jin Hayeon flared their own energies, bracing themselves to stop Eldest Brother’s rampage.\n\"Young Miss!!\"\nA guard from the Hyeokryeon Family, who had been waiting beyond the walls of Windrock Palace, came running.\n“I’VE GOT IT! THE SOLUTION!!”\nI blurted out whatever came to mind first, trying to calm the situation.\nThe moment those words flew out of my mouth, Eldest Brother's manic gaze turned to me. The energy flared from his body still rampaging wildly. My chest tightened and my heart felt constricted, even the mere process of breathing became painful. I squeezed out what little internal energy I had and raised my voice.\n“Promoting the Third Squad Leader to the second-in-command is the best course of action!”\n\"Why?\"\nAs if his personality had suddenly changed, the Eldest Brother asked briefly, his eyes already half-crazed.\nWhy?\nIt was simple.\n\"You said he's the most meticulous with his work, so he can handle tasks in your place when you're absent or busy!\"\nIn other words, he was the most suitable person to dump work on. After all, isn't it natural that when you choose the most capable person as your subordinate, it makes things easier for those above?\n'Just like that damn team leader!!'\nIt was a solution that popped into my head because I was reminded of that team leader from when I was Seo Ji-hoon, the guy who pawned work off on me and ducked out even as I was dying.\nOf course, if the Third Squad Leader were competent in all areas, there would have been no need for the Eldest Brother to worry in the first place.\n\"You mentioned his martial skills are the weakest among the squad leaders, but that doesn't matter! After all, you, as commander, can cover that with your strength. Therefore, the second-in-command should be chosen to complement your weaknesses.\"\nThe Eldest Brother who had been eerily listening to my argument in a manner uncharacteristic of a mad demon cackled eerily as soon as I finished speaking.\n“KHAHAHAHA!!!”\nLike a madman, no, true to being a madman, threw his head back and roared with laughter. Then, he eerily lowered his head and stared at me with eyes full of madness.\nSneer .\n\"So, you're saying… since I'm dumb, I should promote the smart Third Squad Leader to become second-in-command.\"\nWith those words, the ground beneath his feet exploded, and the living bomb charged at me while swinging a greatsword wreathed in swirling red energy.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 24 : Short Fuse (3)",
    "content": "Chapter 24: Short Fuse (3)\nThe moment Eldest Brother's energy locked onto me, I felt my life was in danger. Was that why my body's survival instinct reached its peak, making the world seem to flow in slow motion?\nI could faintly see Third Brother's sword trajectory, which I normally wouldn't have been able to follow with my eyes. Even as the world slowed down, Eldest Brother's figure filled my vision, approaching at a terrifying speed.\nThird Brother's sword managed to wound Eldest Brother's arm, but he charged at me as if such an injury meant nothing. In an instant, the madman's greatsword flew at me, threatening to cleave my body in two. And surrounding that greatsword was an even more massive red energy―a terrifying yang energy that dwarfed my meager internal energy.\nBut I couldn't die here. Though the world moved slowly, the problem was that my body also moved like a slug.\n'Move!! Move!!!'\nMaybe that desperate thought actually got through. The hand that had been gripping the sword since Eldest Brother charged began to draw it, deploying the Soul-Departing Sword I had been practicing.\nThe form I unleashed perfectly intersected the path of Eldest Brother's greatsword. The moment my sword, carrying energy incomparably weaker than Eldest Brother's, clashed with his greatsword, it showed a strange movement and veered to the side. It was an attempt to deflect the force of the greatsword using the seventh form of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, the Soul-Guiding Sword.\nClang!!!\nBut the power gap was just too huge. My sword shattered, barely altering the greatsword's trajectory. However, that split second created by the Soul-Guiding Sword was enough. As I deployed it, I was already pulling my body back.\nOf course, I was still sent flying backward by the force that the Soul-Guiding Sword couldn't fully dissipate, but I avoided instant death. I survived thanks to successfully combining the Soul-Departing Sword, the Soul-Guiding Sword, and my lightness skill in one go. Even I didn't know how I managed to pull it off. It felt like my body moved on its own in that moment of extreme crisis.\nAs I flew back, I saw Third Brother instantly closing in on Eldest Brother, swinging his sword at his back. But Eldest Brother, as if he had eyes on his back, twisted his body to narrowly avoid Third Brother's sneak attack that supposedly didn't even leave a shadow.\nAt that moment, Jin Hayeon dove in from the side, thrusting her twin palms towards Eldest Brother's flank. Her hands, now coated in bone-white frost, radiated a lethal chill—far colder than anything she’d shown during our sparring.\nBut no matter how chilling her White Hand Demonic Art was...\nWhoosh!\nIt was no match for Eldest Brother's Raging Demon Sword Art, which bordered on reaching Transcendence. The yang energy surrounding Eldest Brother's greatsword instantly melted her cold energy.\nBang!!!\nUnable to withstand that tremendous force, Jin Hayeon was sent flying far away.\nThud!\n\"Ugh...\"\nMy airborne trajectory ended abruptly as I crashed a wall, knocking my breath out of me. If I hadn't mixed in the Soul-Guiding Sword at the last moment to reduce the force even slightly, my spine might have been completely shattered.\nHowever, this was no time to lose myself to the pain.\n\"Big Brother!!\"\nSeeing me get hit must have set her off.\nSeon-ah eyes eyes glowing redder than ever as she glared and charged at Eldest Brother.\nIt was madness. Even Jin Hayeon, far stronger than her, had been sent flying in one exchange. But thankfully, the tragedy of Seon-ah being sliced in two didn't occur.\n\"Young Miss!\"\nThe Hyeokryeon Family guard who had just entered Windrock Palace swiftly approached the crazed Seon-ah, pressing her acupoint to knock her unconscious.\nWhoosh!\nAs a consequence, Eldest Brother's greatsword, which had been flying towards Seon-ah, redirected towards the guard.\n\"Urk...\"\nHe couldn’t take a single hit either and went flying. He had fulfilled his duty as a bodyguard by protecting Seon-ah in his arms, but the situation was spiraling into a total disaster.\nWith just three swings, myself, Jin Hayeon, the guard, and Seon-ah had fallen. Only Third Brother remained standing.\n“Get out of here!” Third Brother shouted, his usual gloomy demeanor replaced by grim resolve. But it didn't look like he could hold out for long.\nIn the first place, Third Brother's martial arts were specialized in ambush and sneak attacks rather than direct confrontation, and not to mention their gap in skill. He was barely holding on, like a candle in the wind.\nIf I fled alone to save myself, I might survive, but…\n'Everyone else would die.'\nThe deranged Eldest Brother might take out his anger on those here in my place.\nBut how could I stop that crazed monster...\n\"!!!\"\nAn idea flickered. A way for all to survive. I bolted toward my manor’s main gate like I was running for my life and just before I exited the Windrock Palace, I roared with all my might at the madman who was toying Third Brother:\n\"Hey, you brainless meathead!!! Is your head just for decoration?!\"\nFuck it, we ball.\nWith that, I bolted out of the courtyard with everything I had.\n\"I'll kill you!!!\"\nBang!!!\nA thunderous roar erupted as Eldest Brother launched himself into the air and came flying right after me.\n“FUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!”\nFeeling the immense energy from behind rapidly closing in, I cursed at the top of my lungs and ran for my life.\nWhoosh! Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on novelꞁire.net\nA chill shot up my spine. Sensing incoming force, I flung myself sideways.\nKABOOM!!!\nA fireball of red energy slammed into the ground right where I’d just been.\nI scrambled up from the dirt and just kept running.\n\"Aim better, you moron!!!\"\n\"You insect!! I’ll tear you limb by limb!!!\"\nThe shouts of the completely enraged madman grew closer, and more bursts of red energy flew at me in succession.\nHow long had I been running while provoking this ticking bomb bastard?\nThough it felt like an eternity in this life-or-death situation, barely ten seconds had passed before the mad demon finally caught up to me.\n\"Die!\"\nAs the living bomb swung his greatsword at me again—\nClang!!\nA spear, a sword, and a saber flew in from somewhere, blocking the madman's greatsword.\nThese strangers whose faces I didn't even recognize were martial artists stationed nearby by the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nIt was only natural. This was the main headquarters, and martial artists were crawling all over the place.\nIt was a natural arrangement considering this place was a place where people falling into the Qi Deviation is practically a norm. When someone went insane, those stationed nearby would subdue the maddened individuals.\nThis was precisely why I had deliberately provoked Eldest Brother and lured him out here.\nWaiting for reinforcements to arrive at Windrock Palace would’ve gotten someone killed, so I reversed the situation by leading Eldest Brother to where martial artists were likely to be.\nWhile the three martial artists blocked Eldest Brother's greatsword—\n\"We just need to buy time until Master arrives!\"\nThird Brother, who had somehow caught up to Eldest Brother, shouted as he joined the three.\nNow that it was four-on-one instead of one-on-one, it looked like they might actually have a chance.\nBang!!\n\"Urgh...\"\nOr so it seemed, until another person failed to withstand the attack and was sent flying, crashing into and crumbling a wall.\nMore demonic cultivators were converging on the scene, but the situation suggested that those here might die at this rate.\n\"Why pick on weaklings, you blockhead!\"\nI provoked Eldest Brother again.\n\"You bastard!!!\"\nAs expected, because he was completely consumed by rage or simply lacked the capacity for thought, Eldest Brother ignored the three surrounding him and charged straight at me.\nBang!!\nThanks to his predictable and simple movement, the three were able to block Eldest Brother’s attack more easily.\nClang!!\nAnd stopped his sword right before my face.\n\"Eek.\"\nI stumbled back, watching the scene of them subduing the raging fiery boar.\n\"Not just dumb, but blind too?\"\nWhenever they seemed to be pushed back, I provoked Eldest Brother again.\n\"Kill! Kill!! I'll kill you!!!\"\nAfter several rounds of ragebaiting, the deranged boar found himself surrounded by dozens of cultists.\nI watched him flail his sword, spewing fire like a one-man fireworks show, when—\n\"Everyone, stand back.\"\nA familiar voice pierced my ears.\nThe Lord of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, and the teacher of both myself and that raging fiery boar over there, had finally arrived.\nAs if his words were imbued with power, those surrounding Eldest Brother immediately retreated far back at our Master's command.\nEldest Brother, already consumed by rage, swung his greatsword at me as soon as those blocking him disappeared.\nBang!!\nAnd our Master effortlessly blocked that strike with a sword drawn so swiftly I couldn’t track it.\nWoong!!!\nA deep, ink-black energy seeped from his body where their clashed with Eldest Brother's.\nUnlike the wild and violent energy that Eldest Brother emitted, this aura radiated a crushing weight, like how majestic mountains pressing down the world.\nEldest Brother buckled under that mountainous pressure and within a moment, his knees slamming into the ground. And so, the rampage of the rage-filled maniac came to an end with Master's intervention.\nEldest Brother's rampage resulted in a total of nine injuries.\nMiraculously, there were no fatalities. Just six with severe injuries and three with minor injuries.\nConsidering Eldest Brother's level, they say this level of damage is practically nothing.\nAnd I, classified as one of the severely injured, was resting in the infirmary.\nMy entire body was bruised and my muscles shocked from blocking Eldest Brother's attack and hitting the wall. I had also suffered internal injuries.\nI had received treatment, but with Windrock Palace half-destroyed, I was to remain in the infirmary until it was repaired.\nAnd by my side...\n\"Young Master, it's time to begin your studies.\"\n… was Jin Hayeon with bandages on both arms and splints applied. She was there with her signature expressionless face.\nApparently, the force of Eldest Brother's attack had fractured the bones in her arms.\nAnd her takeaway was that she was lucky her bones hadn’t shattered? Yeah. She was completely nuts.\n“We’re both injured and you still talk about study ? ”\nI asked incredulously, but her reply was as blunt as ever.\n“Since your injuries prevent you from practicing internal art and forbid you from practicing external art, why not use this time to make progress on our cult’s laws? Once you recovered, I will ramp up your training to catch up the martial arts training you missed.”\n\"...\"\nYep, definitely not right in the head.\nStill, I couldn’t really yell at the woman who’d gotten her arms fractured trying to save me from that raging boar.\nBesides, I had bigger problems.\n‘Well, my life in this cult is officially fucked.’\nI had babbled whatever came to mind because my life was in immediate danger, but I had turned the Heavenly Demon’s First Disciple into my enemy.\nRegardless of the situation, I had continuously insulted his intelligence, which he hates more than anything and the main trigger to his outburst.\n\"Very well, let us begin. Since my arms are like this, please open the book, Young Master.\"\nAs I was lost in thought, half-dazed by Jin Hayeon's insane ramblings and worries about the thorny path ahead in my life in this damned cult.\nI heard a commotion from beyond the medical wing.",

    "content": "Chapter 25: Short Fuse (4)\n“We greet the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons!”\n“All hail, the Heavenly Demon!”\nThe commotion in the medical wing erupted the moment my Master arrived. Every physician and attendant in the room fell into a frenzy, clamoring praises without restraint.\nAnd soon after.\nSwoosh\nThe door of the medical wing where I was staying opened, and Master entered.\n\"That's enough. Stay seated,\" he said sternly, halting Jin Hayeon as she tried to bow despite the splints and bandages binding her arms.\nHis gaze then shifted to me.\n\"How are you feeling?\"\n\"Thanks to swift treatment, there are no critical injuries.\"\n\"That's a relief. I heard what happened. When Jin-hak went berserk, it was thanks to your quick thinking that the damage was minimized.\"\nI smiled faintly at the master's praise.\nIt wasn't a smile of joy from being praised. I had risked my life provoking a mad boar, so a reward is overdue, right?\n\"Then, perhaps you're giving me some kind of reward?\"\nI’d learned humility as a child, but experience taught me this:\nIf you just wait patiently believing you'll be rewarded someday, you'll only be forgotten.\nYou must strike the iron while it’s hot.\n\"Young Master! How could you say such a thing to the Supreme One?!\"\nOf course, Jin Hayeon beside me was shocked, uncharacteristically so, but that was none of my concern.\n\"A reward… Indeed. The Hyeokryeon Family has decided not to hold Jin-hak accountable, thanks to your intervention. A reward is fitting.\"\n\"You went to the Hyeokryeon Family as well?\"\nHe nodded.\n\"The girl admitted that the initial cause of the Jin-hak's rampage was due to her words. Moreover, the testimonies of the guards and the girl were consistent. They spoke of how you provoked your Eldest Brother and lured him away to save everyone there.\"\nIt seemed that Master had been cleaning up the aftermath of the Eldest Brother’s rampage while I was bedridden.\n“What about Eldest Brother?”\n\"For now, I've confined him to the Closed Meditation Chamber as punishment. And I've bestowed recovery elixirs and some money to those injured this time for their recovery, so it seems right to give a reward to you who did the most important work.\"\nOho.\nI wonder what kind of reward he'll give.\nSince it was a reward being given by none other than the leader of this massive cult, my expectations soared.\nAnd after seemingly contemplating for a moment while stroking his beard, Master finally spoke of the reward he would bestow upon me.\n“This old one will aid your recovery using True Qi Guidance and acupuncture treatment. Additionally, I shall dedicate more time to overseeing your martial training.”\n\"......\"\nWhat's that supposed to be?\nThis is just more labor disguised as a favor!\nMy face nearly twisted into a scowl, but I reined it in just in time.\n\"The Supreme One’s grace is truly as vast as the heavens!\"\nBeside me, Jin Hayeon was shouting praises with a face that looked like she might burst into tears at any moment.\nWell, from the perspective of fanatics, what could be more gracious than spending more time with their leader?\nEven for non-fanatics, martial artists would pay millions for the chance to learn martial arts from someone like Master.\nThe problem?\n‘I don’t need any of that shit!!’\nI wasn't a fanatic, nor was I that obsessed with martial arts.\nBut thanks to Jin Hayeon's reaction, I realized something.\nThat as the cult leader’s disciple, I had to feign gratitude.\n'Damn it.'\n\"This humble disciple is eternally grateful for your benevolence.\" My face felt like it might be about to cramp as I forced myself to show a moved expression contrary to my true feelings.\nThankfully, Master changed the subject before my expression betrayed me.\n\"Ahem. This old man's visit wasn’t solely for this.\"\n\"Was there some kind of problem?\"\n\"Rather than a problem, your Eldest Brother said he wanted to talk with you, Il-mok.\"\n\"?!\"\n\"Normally, the rules of the Closed Meditation Chamber forbid meeting or talking with anyone, but since he just entered, I’m willing to allow a brief visit before the real punishment begins. So I came to see what you wanted to do.”\nIt was unexpected news.\nThat mad boar wants to see me as soon as he comes to his senses?\n'Could it be... he wants to kill me?'\nThat thought came to mind first, but it would be difficult for him to kill me while confined in the Closed Meditation Chamber.\nRather, it seemed like an opportunity.\nIf things were left as they were, I was in danger of becoming mortal enemies with Eldest Brother.\nYeah, he was the one who went crazy first, but I’m sure he wasn’t thrilled about me calling him an idiot on repeat.\nWouldn't it be better to clear up the misunderstanding with Eldest Brother now while he's safely locked up in the Closed Meditation Chamber?\n'If it works out, great. If it fails, I lose nothing.'\nHaving finished that train of thought, I answered Master.\n“Is the door to the Closed Meditation Chamber sturdy enough?\"\nOf course, my safety was the top priority.\nIl-mok and the Heavenly Demon entered the Closed Meditation Chamber.\n\"This is the place.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon pointed to an iron door visible beyond the torchlight.\n\"This old man will wait here, so go and have your conversation.\"\nHe meant to stay out of the disciples’ affairs.\nIl-mok hesitated for a moment but approached the iron door thinking it should be safe.\n\"Eldest Brother. Are you there?\"\n\"It's the youngest.\"\nIn response to Il-mok's question, Wi Jin-hak's voice came from beyond the iron door.\n\"I heard you were looking for me.\"\n\"Hahahahaha. I called you to apologize. My training is still lacking, so I couldn't control my anger.\"\nHis laughter boomed through the iron door, echoing like a cave’s resonance.\nGone was the frenzied rage; this was his usual, foolish tone.\nAt this point, Il-mok wondered if he might be bipolar rather than having a short fuse.\n'Still, it seems he hasn't held a grudge.'\nIl-mok let out an internal sigh of relief.\nHowever, the thought of leaving things as they were left him feeling oddly unsatisfying.\n\"I also came to apologize. I had to do it to keep everyone from getting killed, but I’m still sorry I used the word you hate the most.”\n\"Hahahahaha. Now that my head is clear, I understand why you did it. It was just a problem caused by your brother's stupid head.\"\nWi Jin-hak was once again setting up a landmine.\nIl-mok considered responding with 'You're not stupid, Eldest Brother,' Like how he’d placated Seo Wan-pyeong when he came in the middle of the night.\nBut somehow, he felt that wouldn't work for the Eldest Brother.\nEldest Brother's issue wasn’t paranoia, it was a rage disorder.\nAnd seeing how he lived with the word \"stupid\" on his lips but yet went ballistic when he heard it from someone else, it reeked a kind of inferiority complex.\nWhile Il-mok wasn't a psychiatrist, he had enough experience to recognize the pattern.\n'The iron door is protecting me anyway, so it should be fine to push a little.'\nFeeling secure, Il-mok carefully opened his mouth.\n\"Eldest Brother. Do you remember when I recommended the Third Squad Leader for the position of second-in-command?\"\n\"I do.\"\nThe calm reply made Il-mok swallow nervously before continuing.\n\"I didn't say that to disrespect you. Think of the old saying, 'The more, the better.’ Han Xin told Emperor Gaozu of Han that he only could lead an army of 100,000 men. However, he said that for himself, the more soldiers he had, the better. On the other hand, Han Xin said that Emperor Gaozu of Han could lead generals while Han Xin himself could only command soldiers.\"\nOf course, a few years after that incident, Han Xin was framed and purged by Liu Bang. Well, it was part of the process of purging founding contributors to strengthen imperial power, but there was also a joke that he was killed because Liu Bang was still upset about that incident.\n\"Similarly, in Shu Han, Zhuge Liang was known as the smartest, but Liu Bei was the ruler. Thus, a leader’s worth lies not in brilliance, but in charisma and deploying talent wisely. And you, Eldest Brother, are the First Disciple of the Heavenly Demon and the future leader of our divine cult.\"\n(TL Note: The Han of those two are the same Han Dynasty but in two different times.)\nDuring Il-mok's long-winded speech, Wi Jin-hak didn't utter a single word from beyond the iron door.\n‘Oh, crap. Did I overdo it?’\nJust as Il-mok was trembling with foreboding, feeling that in his attempt to clear up a misunderstanding, he had only made it bigger…\n\"Let’s go.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon, who had approached without notice, snapped Il-mok out of his thoughts.\n\"Yes...\"\nAs Il-mok trudged out with slumped shoulders, thinking he had messed up, the Heavenly Demon suddenly spoke.\n\"You did well.\"\n\"???\"\nWhat on earth did he do well?\nIl-mok wanted to ask, but for some reason, the Heavenly Demon’s gaze was directed towards the iron door, not at Il-mok.\n‘It wasn’t intentional, but the timing couldn’t have been more fitting.’\nThe Heavenly Demon had noticed the change occurring inside the Closed Meditation Chamber beyond the iron door.\n'They say there's such a thing as heaven-sent fate, and this child must be the divine providence that heaven has bestowed upon our Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.'\nHe couldn't explain it any other way, as the boy had succeeded in something that couldn't be achieved through effort.\n“For accomplishing this, you deserve another reward.”\n\"???\"\n\"Hmm. But for this matter, rather than this old man taking action, it seems right to leave it to Jin-hak.\"\nFaced with content he couldn't comprehend at all, Il-mok's confusion only grew.\n‘Entrusting my reward to Eldest Brother? Is he offering my head on a silver platter?’\nMeanwhile.\nInside the iron door.\nIn the dark cave where only the soft light of a single night lantern dimly spread.\nThere, Wi Jin-hak sat in lotus position, deep in meditation.\nOr more precisely, he was locked in a battle against the demonic energy seared into his mind and the depths of his psyche.\nBut this struggle was unlike any before.\nUnlike how he used to fiercely clash with the demonic energy of the Raging Demon Sword Art and endure the surging rage, he was now merely observing with detachment.\n― Kill that bastard right now!!\n― How dare he mock me as a fool!!!\nEven as he heard the rampaging demonic energy ordering him to kill his youngest brother, Wi Jin-hak’s heart remained still.\nThanks to the youngest’s words, he realized something.\nHad it been empty consolation saying he wasn't stupid he might have burned with anger instead.\nHe now understood that such insults were beneath him.\nAs the First Disciple, destined to lead, such trifles were irrelevant.\nOf course, there had been others who said similar things before.\nAnd most of them either died by his hands or narrowly escaped death thanks to their Master's timely appearance.\nAs the Heavenly Demon believed, it took divine providence for an advice to lead to an enlightenment.\nOnly when an advice arrived at the precise moment, in the perfect circumstances, could it truly take root.\nAnd Wi Jin-hak had been ready.\nHaving neared the state of Transcendent and already vented all of his build-up frustration and anger yesterday, he was in a state ready to hear the youngest brother's advice.\nAt that flawless, unforeseen instant—unanticipated even by the Heavenly Demon, who had taught and watched over him for decades—Il-mok’s words had struck true.\n― Kill him!\n― Kill all those who disrespect me!\n― Burn this unjust world to ashes!! Thɪs chapter is updatᴇd by NoveIＦire.net\nThe voice of his inner demon screamed in rage.\nThe demonic energy raged, wreaking havoc throughout his meridians and assaulting his mind. But Wi Jin-hak maintained an uncharacteristic clarity and simply observed.\nBang!!!\nSuddenly, something within him shattered. The blocked pathways in his mind opened, releasing a torrent of pent-up demonic energy that surged through his meridians, purging impurities and even contorting his muscles and joints.\nDespite the agonizing pain, Wi Jin-hak merely observed himself, forgetting the world and focusing on his enlightenment.\nWhen the pain ceased and the raging energy settled calmly into his dantian, he opened his eyes.\nSnap!\nIt was the moment he crossed the final wall and achieved the state of Transcendence.\n\"The smell is terrible.\"\nHe wrinkled his nose at the stench of impurities expelled from his body. He channeled the Raging Demon Sword Art and heat burst from his hands.\nIt was an incredible sight.\nFlames devoured the filth clinging to his body, yet not a single burn appeared on his skin.\nWi Jin-hak, now in perfect control over the eemonic energy of the Raging Demon Sword Art scratched his chin and delved in thoughts.\n'Gathering talent and deploying them in the right places, huh.'\nA certain face came to mind.\n\"The youngest brother needs to grow quickly. He'll have to become my strategist in the future.\"",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 26",
    "content": "Chapter 26\nMaster kept his promise.\nAfter that awkward meeting with Eldest Brother, despite his busy schedule, he personally performed the True Qi Guidance and personally fixed my meridians for me.\nThanks to the fact that he is the supreme master within this Demonic Cult and he personally performed those treatments, my body was able to recover quickly without any lingering effects from the injuries, and I was able to leave the medical wing after just a few days.\nAnd to my luck, the Windrock Palace had been fully repaired within that short span of time. Even then, Master fulfilled his promise to me.\nThat is to say—\n\"Huff. Huff.\"\n\"Tsk. How will you strike at the enemy's weak point if you're so slow?\"\nHe worked me like a dog.\nI had noticed it during the last mission, but this man didn’t know the meaning of moderation. Then again, to become the leader of this den of madmen, a half-hearted effort wouldn’t have been enough.\nFor Master, a life of endlessly striving was the norm.\n‘Just let me rest, for fuck’s sake!!’\nI was the type who only aimed to achieve the bare minimum required to complete my task.\nThat said, Master didn’t keep me occupied all day.\nHe was a busy person as the cult leader, after all.\nRoughly six hours a day, maybe?\nBut even though it was only six hours, being pushed to the extreme for six hours straight left me utterly exhausted.\nBy the time I had endured about ten days of this hellish training with Master—\n\"Hmm. I think you've gotten the hang of it, so starting tomorrow, we'll return to the previous schedule of two hours a day.\"\nMaster finally declared my liberation.\nAnd my daily life returned to normal.\nIn the morning, I take history lessons from Jin Hayeon.\n\"Please turn to the next page, Young Master.\"\nOf course, there was no way the cracks in her bones could have healed in just ten days.\nI told her she should just take a break until she recovered, but she didn’t listen to me.\n―As Young Master's attendant, how could I rest easy after failing to protect you?\nSo there she is, with both her arms broken, yet still insisting on teaching. Maybe she feels more at ease if she does the bare minimum of her duty? Either way, being a hybrid child of fanaticism and psychopathy is truly something.\nPsychopaths are supposed to prioritize their own safety, but for Jin Hayeon, the Demonic Cult came first. That’s why she never abandoned her duties even when her own body was injured.\nHowever, since she couldn’t use her arm, she was limited to teaching and couldn’t attend to my other needs. So they had to assign another servant to pick up the slack.\nAs our lesson was wrapping up, there was a knock at the door.\n\"Come in.\"\nAs soon as I gave permission, the door opened, and the attendant who had recently been assisting Jin Hayeon entered.\nHe was tall—around six feet—and looked like a college student who had been a bit of a troublemaker in his high school days.\n‘Who the hell is this guy?’\nThis was definitely not the usual servant\nAnd since when did I have a male servant? That was just weird,\nFortunately, the other party resolved my confusion.\n\"I greet Young Master Il-mok. I am Ouyang Mun, a member of the White Tortoise Group.\"\nHowever, questions still lingered.\n\"But what brings a warrior of the White Tortoise Corps here?\"\nI had no connection to this guy. He was a complete stranger, and I had no ties to the White Tortoise Corps either.\nThe guy stammered for a second, then looked over at Jin Hayeon.\n“Well, I actually came to see Hayeon. I heard she's been staying in Windrock Palace and hasn't come out, so I came here to find her.\"\nI looked at Jin Hayeon with a puzzled expression. She responded with her characteristic emotionless face.\n\"He's a fellow graduate from the Hall of the Demonic Way, Young Master.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nDid this place also have a culture that shouted ‘love your country, love your classmates’?\n\"You two must have been quite close at the Hall of the Demonic Way?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n“We were just in the same class.”\nThe man and woman gave contrasting answers to my question.\nHearing the line drawn by her answer, the young man’s face flushed and he shouted at her.\n\"Just a classmate?! Have you already forgotten our memories of competing for the top spot?!\"\nOho.\nSo, they actually competed for the first place among the most talented individuals in this damned cult.\n\"So which of you graduated from the Hall of the Demonic Way as the top student?\"\nAt my question, Jin Hayeon looked at Ouyang Mun with a cold look, while Ouyang Mun rubbed under his nose with his index finger, showing an ambiguous reaction that seemed both proud and embarrassed.\n'Did he come here to brag?'\nSuppressing my bewilderment, I asked.\n\"So, what is it you want to say to Miss Jin?\"\nThe young man’s body flinched and then glanced between me and Jin Hayeon while behaving fidgetily.\n'Is it something he can't say in front of me?'\nWhile I was pondering this question, he opened his mouth while subtly avoiding Jin Hayeon's gaze.\n“Ahem. Well, I heard... that you were injured while stopping the First Young Master's rampage. You see, you should have trained harder.”\n\"Are you trying to say I'm weak?\"’\nThe class valedictorian had just spoken. And the salutatorian replied in a voice that could freeze fire. “I’m not calling you weak! I just don’t get why you’re wasting your talent doing menial work as an attendant. Have you forgotten our promise? We promised at the Hall of the Demonic Way to do great things together for the Divine Cult.\"\n“I chose this path for that very purpose as it allows me to stay close to the Supreme One and his disciples. If I keep getting stronger and prove myself, one day I might even become the Heavenly Demon’s shadow. As a member of the cult, where could there be a more glorious path than this?”\nUntil now, I have been harboring one question while living with Jin Hayeon.\nWhy was she, an esteemed graduate of the illustrious Hall of the Demonic Way, choose to work as an attendant, more so now that I know she graduated second in her class.\nBut now, I know the answer to that question.\n'Hmm. So her goal is to become like that person who was always by Master's side?'\nThe man who dealt with the assassins from the Murim Alliance when Master was kidnapping me. Come to think of it, that man had been wandering the martial world alone with the Master, so he must have been in charge of all the miscellaneous tasks.\nIn other words, to become the personal guard of the Heavenly Demon, you had to be a butler and a one-man army all at once.\nBut Ouyang Mun didn't seem to accept that answer.\n“That’s just an excuse! You’re just scared to aim higher, so you’re hiding behind this nonsense and ditching the promise we made!”\nAs I watched Ouyang Mun shouting indignantly with a reddened face, a thought crossed my mind.\n‘What was that thing called again…’\nAh, right! Tsundere.\nOn the surface, it might seem like he was red from anger, but if you look closely at his eyes, they tell a different story.\nFrom the way he averted his gaze whenever he met Jin Hayeon's eyes, it was clear he was head over heels for her.\nBut tsundere? Really?\n'What is he, an elementary grade-schooler?' Fresh chapters posted on novel⟡fire.net\nConstantly picking fights with the girl you like. It was the kind of thing that only elementary schoolers would do.\nNo, even elementary school kids these days don't act like that anymore.\n'I guess that's what you get with someone from the old days.'\nRegardless of my thoughts on the matter...\n\"Are you looking down on my duty of serving the disciple of the Supreme One?\"\n\"I'm not looking down on it! It's just the truth! Have you been training properly since you started this servant duty? You haven’t seen any real fights! We used to be equals, but now I’d wipe the floor with you.”\nThe two of them were engaged in a heated argument.\n'Ah, young love.'\nAs a guy in his mid-thirties, watching these two bicker like college kids was kind of adorable.\nWell, except for the fact that it was one-sided.\n\"And what's so great about being an attendant anyway! It's the people you serve who are impressive; the duty itself isn't anything special!\"\n\"Can you take responsibility for those words?\"\n\"Responsibility? What responsibility?\"\n\"If you're so confident, why don't you try it yourself?\"\n“Hah! You think I can’t? Fine! Since your arms are busted anyway, I’ll take over as Young Master Il-mok’s attendant until you’re better!”\nOuyang Mun's face twitched as he shouted this.\nAt first glance, he might have looked angry, but I could see it.\n'He's absolutely thrilled. Over the moon even.'\nHe was having a hard time hiding his smile at the thought of being able to stay close to Jin Hayeon all day under the pretext of serving me.\nAnd to manage his expression, he suddenly fumbled with his sleeve and pulled something out, and handed it to Jin Hayeon.\nIt was a small container filled with what looked like expensive medicinal herbs.\n“Here, take this so you heal faster! D-don’t get the wrong idea! I’m a busy man, I can’t substitute you for long, so I’m giving this to you because I have no choice!”\nOh, give me a break.\nNot long after, the servant who had been attending to me in Jin Hayeon's place came, but...\n\"I will be serving the Young Master, so you may leave.\"\nBefore I could even open my mouth, Ouyang Mun had already shooed her away. The idea of a man serving me felt a bit odd, but Ouyang Mun’s skills weren’t as bad as I expected.\nMaybe because of his experience as a graduate of the Hall of the Demonic Way and the youngest member of the White Tortoise Corps.\n\"Isn't it hot today, Young Master? Well, as it happens, I'm quite skilled with a fan. Haha.\"\n\"Haha! I knew you'd say that, so I brought water in advance, Young Master!\"\nLike a diligent new recruit in the army, he was quick-witted and attentive to my needs.\n\"Hmm. Why are you here, young man?\"\nOf course, when my Master visited in the afternoon, he also questioned this situation.\n“Replying to the Supreme One, this one is helping out his fellow disciple until the White Tortoise Corps assigns me to another mission.”\nMaster simply nodded and accepted his smooth answer. “Haha. To see such harmony between disciples, it’s truly pleasing to the eye.”\n“Har- harmony? Y- you are too kind Supreme One! Ahahaha!”\nFunnily enough, his composure completely crumbled when he was dealing with anything related to Jin Hayeon.\nAs for a certain ice-block he was completely infatuated with…\n“…”\nShe just stared at him with cold eyes akin to those of a wicked mother-in-law waiting for her daughter-in-law to make a mistake.\n‘Seeing that he still likes her even after receiving such treatment, that guy is definitely not in his right mind either.’\nThen again, how many sane people could there be in this den of madmen?\nFor some reason, the sight of his one-sided love felt pitiable to me, so I decided to let him stay as a temporary attendant.\nAbsolutely not because I found the situation amusing.\n“Haha! I’ve been practicing acupoint massage on the seniors of the White Tortoise Corps so many times that I’ve become quite skilled at it, Young Master.”\nSince he had his use, I didn’t dismiss him outright.\nLike that, I spent my days sparring with him or Third Brother whenever he popped up to my place, receiving Master’s teachings, and attending morning lectures with Jin Hayeon.\nOnly when days had passed did I realized one thing, ‘Where is Little Seon-ah?’\nThe little kid who used to visit me without fail every day hadn’t shown her face for half a month now.",

    "content": "Chapter 27\nAt first, I just figured she was avoiding me because I was resting in the medical wing. And thanks to my Master working me like a dog, I couldn’t spare any attention to her.\nBut now, it's been over two weeks, and she still hasn't shown her face. \"Don't tell me the Hyeokryeon Family is actually stopping her?\"\nThey never liked her hanging around me anyway, so it wouldn't surprise me if they were using this whole thing as an excuse to keep her away.\n'Tsk. What did a child do to deserve this?'\nSomething didn't sit right with me.\nThe incident stemmed from Eldest Brother’s outburst in the first place; that child didn’t do anything wrong.\nBut meddling in another family’s affairs isn’t a wise decision either.\n\"Hmm.\"\nAfter pondering for a moment, I made my decision. \"I'll skip review today. Prepare the bath, I have somewhere to visit.\"\nI decided to visit the Hyeokryeon Family directly.\nI wasn't planning to cause a scene. Nor did I intend to demand they send her back to Windrock Palace or make similar complaints. I simply want to visit as a guest and see the kid's face before leaving. That much wouldn't count as excessive interference.\nAfter getting ready, I headed to the Hyeokryeon Family compound with Jin Hayeon and Ouyang Mun.\nAs we walked, we were greeted by the martial artists and workers of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult who recognized me. After a short while, we finally reached the front gate of the Hyeokryeon Family compound.\nIt felt strange.\nI had taken Seon-ah's visits for granted and only now realized that this was the first time I was actually visiting the Hyeokryeon Family compound.\n'That little one walked this path every day to see me.'\nWhile I was lost in such thoughts, the Hyeokryeon Family's gatekeeper who recognized me offered a greeting.\n\"Greetings, Eighth Young Master. Please wait a moment while I announce your arrival inside.\"\n\"Very well.\"\nThe gatekeeper spoke with polite words but without a hint of warmth in his tone.\nAfter waiting briefly, the gate opened and an old man came out to receive us. \"I am Hyeokryeon Hak, the steward of the Hyeokryeon Family. Allow me to escort you inside.\"\nWe followed the head steward, who was apparently from a minor branch of the family, toward one of the buildings on the grounds.\n\"My Lady. Young Master Il-mok has arrived.\"\n\"Let him enter.\"\nBetween what the steward said and the voice from inside, I could figure out who it was.\nIt was Lady Cheonghwa, Seon-ah's mother.\nThe head steward acted like his job was done, and Jin Hayeon and Ouyang Mun took the hint and stood with him, ready to wait outside. Though I felt like a civil servant about to face a problematic complainant, I walked into the room with my head held high. After all, I was no longer a civil servant.\n\"It's been a while, Eighth Young Master.\"\n\"It's been a while, Lady Cheonghwa.\"\nWe exchanged brief bows with the same polite yet cold manner that characterized Lady Cheonghwa's greeting.\n\"Please sit.\" Lady Cheonghwa motioned me to sit and poured tea into the cup from a teapot she had prepared.\nAfter pouring tea into her own cup as well, Lady Cheonghwa asked. \"So, what brings you to visit our Hyeokryeon Family in person?\"\nSince she skipped the pleasantries and went straight to the point, I didn’t bother with them either.\n\"I haven’t seen Seon-ah for days, so I came in person.\"\n\"You speak as if Seon-ah were your subordinate.\"\n\"If Seon-ah is staying away of her own volition, I have no intention of making an issue of it. But if not—\"\nHer gaze sharpened at my reply. \"Are you suggesting that her own family is oppressing her?\"\n“Aren’t you?”\nLady Cheonghwa and I engaged in a staring contest for a while. Eventually, as if deciding it was useless, she lifted her still-steaming cup and took a sip. \"That may have been true before, but it's not the case now.\"\n\"Then are you saying Seon-ah is staying away of her own volition?\"\n\"That's correct.\"\nHer unflinching answer made me frown.\nHonestly, it was hard to believe.\nWhy would that kid suddenly avoid me out of the blue?\nThis was the same little one who used to visit almost daily, calling out, \"Brother! Brother!\"\nBut starting an argument in this situation by saying 'Don't lie!' would only lead to conflict.\n\"Then, could I have a conversation with Seon-ah?\"\n\"Young Master Il-mok. Don't you think you're being too presumptuous with our Hyeokryeon Family, even if you are the Supreme One's disciple?\"\n\"I'm not going to drag her away. I just want to say hi like any other guest and then head out.\" As I replied, I also picked up my teacup and took a small sip.\n'Sss. How did she drink this?'\nI winced at the bitter taste of the scalding tea. But I kept my face neutral, refusing to flinch during this standoff.\nJust as the silence stretched, a voice cut through the stalemate.\n\"Let him meet my granddaughter.\"\n\"??\"\nI turned toward the sound and saw a man whose presence my senses couldn’t detect entering through a side door.\nMy senses didn’t even notice his presence until he spoke.\nThe second he showed up, Lady Cheonghwa rose hurriedly, but he waved her back with a gesture. \"That's enough, do as Young Master Il-mok wishes.\"\n\"But, Family Head...\"\nThanks to Lady Cheonghwa's form of address, I finally realized who this man was.\nThe Head of the Hyeokryeon Family and Lady Cheonghwa's father-in-law. According to Jin Hayeon, he is Hyeokryeon Cheongang, one of the top masters within the cult.\nWhich meant...\n\"I pay my respects to the Hyeokryeon Family Head.\"\nEven if I am the Heavenly Demon's disciple, this wasn't someone I could treat casually.\n\"This is our first time meeting in person. I've heard much about you from the Supreme One and others.\"\nI wondered what kind of stories he had heard.\nThough I was curious, I didn’t get to ask as he continued. \"Go meet Seon-ah. I'll have the steward guide you.\"\nWithout waiting for my response, he turned toward the door I’d entered.\n\"Steward. Guide the Eighth Young Master to Seon-ah.\" His voice was heard loud and clear even from a distance as it contained internal energy.\n\"You may go now.\"\nIt was clearly my cue to leave, so I was happy to get out of there.\nMy purpose was to meet Seon-ah, and I wanted to avoid a battle of wills with that old man. While I could handle someone like Lady Cheonghwa, one look told me that engaging in a battle of wills with that old man would be suicide.\nAfter Il-mok left, silence briefly fell over the pavilion. And it was Hyeokryeon Cheongang who broke that silence.\n\"Don't worry about it. We must keep our promise to the Supreme One.\"\n\"...Understood, Family Head.\"\n\"Our agreement with the Supreme One lasts until the Eighth Young Master enters the Hall of the Demonic Way. If any problems arise with the child until then, or even after, we’ll act as pledged.\"\nAfter saying this, Hyeokryeon Cheongang turned his gaze toward the pavilion where his precious granddaughter resided.\nToward that pavilion where Il-mok was heading.\n\"We’ve arrived, Young Master.\"\nAfter the head steward led me to Seon-ah's room, the first thing I did was walk up and knock on her door.\nEven a child deserves to have their privacy respected.\n\"Seon-ah.\"\nA rustle from inside hinted that she had heard and recognized my voice.\n\"D-d-don't come in.\"\n\"!!!\"\nNo way, is she really trying to avoid me?\n'So this is what it feels like to be a dad with a teenage daughter, huh?'\nThat feeling when a daughter who used to follow you around saying \"I'm going to marry daddy!\" starts keeping her distance during puberty, saying \"Really! Don't come into my room!\"\nFor a moment, it felt as though my long-healed internal injuries were flaring up again, but I forced myself to even my breathing.\n'Wait. Maybe Lady Cheonghwa said something weird to her to make her act like this!'\nBarely enduring my injured heart, I spoke again. \"Seon-ah, can you just tell me why you're avoiding me?\"\n\"B-because you... you almost d-died! And it was my fault.\"\n\"Ah...\"\nOkay, I was starting to get a picture of why she was hiding from me.\n\"Don't worry. That wasn't your fault, it was Eldest Brother's men...\"\nI was about to say mental illness, but realizing there were people around, I quickly adjusted my words.\n\"He was mentally struggling. It wasn't because of you.\"\n\"St-still, I'm scared. I-I'm afraid you might get hurt or die because of me… So-so it's better if we don't see each other.\"\nIt took me a second to realize her reasoning was a little different from what I'd assumed. I had assumed she was avoiding me out of fear that I would hate her because I had nearly died on her account.\nBut no, she feared being the cause of my danger.\n'The side effect of the Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art was excessive obsession.'\nLooked like the thought of someone she cared about getting hurt was way more horrifying to her than the thought of them hating her.\nBut just because I'd figured that out didn't mean I suddenly knew what to do. I was a government worker in my past life, not a psychiatrist.\nSo I relied on what I knew.\n\"I'm coming in for a moment.\"\nBefore Seon-ah could protest, I nudged the door open and slipped inside.\nThe room felt dim and heavy.\nIt looked like she hadn't eaten or washed in days, probably from being tormented by nightmares. Her hair was a greasy mess and her skin looked awful. Seeing her looking like a total wreck, which was just wrong for a kid her age, I carefully walked over to her.\nAs I approached, she slightly averted her gaze like a wounded cat trapped in a dead end.\n\"Hmm. You said it’s better not to see me because you’re scared I’ll get hurt.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But you know what? Not being able to see you hurt me more.\"\n\"!!!\"\nSeeing Seon-ah flinch while avoiding my gaze, I continued speaking. \"Eldest Brother's rampage was like a natural disaster. Sometimes in life, accidents happen even when no one is at fault.\"\nNobody in the world fits together perfectly. Even families that have been together for ages don't get along all the time.\nEveryone has moments where they hurt the people they care about, whether it's with words or by accident.\nDespite this, we continue to make friends, family, and lovers.\nBut we still make friends anyway. Still have families. Still find people to love. And I had done the same.\n\"Hiding from people because you’re scared isn’t the answer. Actually, it's the opposite. The fact that stuff like that can happen is exactly why you need to stick together with people. You can't get through it alone.\"\nPeople can't live by themselves.\nBack in my old life, there were these people we called shut-ins, who'd just lock themselves in their rooms and never come out. But even they weren't truly living alone.\nThough their bodies were confined to their rooms, they were still living while communicating with others somewhere, whether through games or online communities.\n\"That time too, you ran toward that terrifying First Disciple to save me. I only survived because you bought me time. What if you kept avoiding me, and I got into some other accident and died? If you heard about it later, would you be okay?\"\n\"N-no!\"\nFinally, the little one cried out and looked at me. I smiled gently while stroking the matted hair of this wounded kitten. \"Then promise you’ll protect me next time. And if you’re in danger, I’ll protect you.\"\nAfter hesitating for a moment, the little one nodded while hunching her shoulders.\nThe next afternoon. At the usual time, Seon-ah visited Windrock Palace again.\nUnlike yesterday, her hair was clean and she looked all neat.\n\"Hahaha! Welcome! I'm Ouyang Mun, temporarily serving Young Master in place of Hayeon!\"\nFaced with this loud greeting from a guy she'd never met, she immediately ducked behind my legs.\n\"Hahaha. Such a shy young lady.\"\nOuyang Mun—ever sociable except around Jin Hayeon—kept chattering until Jin Hayeon cut in coldly, \"Must be nice, slacking off. Did you think this was playtime?\"\n\"H-hmph! I have time because I've already prepared everything beforehand, unlike a certain rigid workaholic.”\nAs the two kids started another one of their love-spats, I kicked back and watched the show with Seon-ah. Content orıginally comes from novｅlfire.net\nWho needs TV or the internet when you can just watch a youth drama in real-time?\n\"Here. Ah~\"\nFor a short while, I watched the two youths' lovers' quarrel, feeding Seon-ah a snack as if I were watching a drama with my niece.\nThat is until little Seon-ah dropped a nuclear bomb.\n\"By the way, Big Brother. Does that uncle like Sister Hayeon?\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nThe Windrock Palace instantly fell into silence.\n\"Wh-wh-what are you saying!! Wh-who likes who!\"\nOuyang Mun shouted as if having a fit and slightly turned his head to peek at Jin Hayeon, and upon meeting her eyes that gazed at him like an insect, bolted out of the Windrock Palace. \"I-I just remembered something urgent, so I'll be leaving for today!!\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nLooking around the once-again silent Windrock Palace, I let out a light sigh and murmured to myself.\n“Now who’s going fetch my tea…?”",

    "content": "Chapter 28: Audit (1)\nOuyang Mun, who fled in defeat, returned by evening. Carrying a fully prepared dinner tray.\n\"Why did you come back?\"\nIn response to Jin Hayeon's cold question, Ouyang Mun forced a hearty laugh.\n\"Ha, haha! The work I'd forgotten was finished faster than expected. And, well, you’re still recovering—how could I abandon my duty to serve Young Master? I’m a man of responsibility! Hahaha!\"\nHe said all that, but he couldn't seem to look Jin Hayeon in the eye, so he just rushed to set the table in front of me.\n“P-Please, enjoy your meal, Young Master!\"\n\"I will.\"\nIt felt like I was watching them shoot a comedy scene.\nAs I awkwardly picked at the food with my chopsticks—\n\"Earlier, Young Lady Seon-ah mentioned something.\"\n\"Wh-What? I-I didn’t hear anything!\"\nThe moment Jin Hayeon tried to probe, Ouyang Mun started freaking out again.\nUnfortunately for him, his opponent is Jin Hayeon.\n“That you like me. Is it true?”\n\"W-wh-what! M-me, like you? Ha. D-don't be ridiculous.\"\nWatching Ouyang Mun flail like a chicken being choked, I couldn’t help but sigh and dig into my dinner.\n\"Good grief.\"\nI'd pretty much figured it out from his earlier maidenless behaviors, but his current act convinced me.\nThis man has no rizz.\nAfter the dinner ended, I followed my scheduled routine. Namely reviewing today’s study material, going to bathe, and enjoying the massage performed by my attendant.\n\"Miss Jin, I'm getting hungry. Could you go get us some snacks? My hands are a little tied up, so have a servant from the kitchen to bring them together.\"\nThe second I gave Jin Hayeon something to do, Ouyang Mun, who was scrubbing me down, yelped.\n\"No, Young Master! I'll go!\"\n“Enough. Miss Jin will handle it.”\nI basically forced Jin Hayeon to go run the errand. The moment she left Windrock Palace—\n\" Whew .\"\n—I turned to Ouyang Mun. The reason I sent her on this errand was to have a private conversation with this pitiful soul.\nMeddling in others’ love lives wasn’t my style, but I couldn’t ignore him. Not after Seon-ah had already dropped the bombshell.\n\"Do you like Miss Jin that much?\"\n\"Wh-wh-what are you talking about!?\"\nI frowned as he started freaking out like a chicken being choked again.\n\"It hurts.\"\nIn his panic, Ouyang Mun had just ground the washing stone into my skin. It wasn't bleeding, but it was bright red.\n\"M-My apologies.\"\n\"Anyway, your whole approach here is terrible.\"\n\"Wh-what do you mean by my approach?\"\n\"Just a moment ago, for instance. How can you expect to make progress if a mere question of you liking her or not already sent you spiralling into a panic?”\n\"B-but it's embarrassing! I can't just come out and say I like her.\"\n\"Tsk, tsk, tsk.\"\nAs someone who had navigated the complexities of romance three times in my thirty-four years of life, I felt obligated to offer some guidance.\n\"People naturally favor those who show them affection. And almost nobody likes people who keep saying they hate them.\"\nOf course, there are exceptions, such as when the person pursuing you has a terrible personality or some major issue, but generally, that's how it is.\n\"Maybe if Miss Jin was already into you, that would be one thing. But you're in a spot where you should be working hard to win her over, and instead you're telling everyone you can't stand her. Why would she like a guy like that?\"\n\"B-but I've been nice to her!\"\n\"When?\"\n\"Well... like when I gave her medicine, and when I served the Young Master in her place...\"\nI couldn't hide how dumbfounded I was.\n\"...You talk to her like that and you really think you're being nice?\"\n\"...Then what should I do? Should I confess my feelings?\"\nNow that he was finally ready to listen, Ouyang Mun stopped applying the medicinal paste and asked a question.\nA rather foolish question at that.\n“Listen carefully. A confession isn’t about declaring your feelings to the other person.”\n“!? Wh-What does that even mean? A confession is a confession!”\n\"No. Confession is the final question to confirm what’s already been built between you. The last step to verify mutual feelings between two people. Not the first.\"\n\"!!!\"\nHe gaped at me, wide-eyed.\nFair enough, I was also just as clueless as he was during my first crush in high school.\n\"Th-then—”\nI cut him off.\n\"Also! You can't keep being 'nice' the way you've been doing it. You have to do small favors, but she actually has to be able to tell it's a favor. You don't want to be obvious like, 'I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU!' but just enough to make her think, 'Huh? Is this guy into me?' You want to keep her guessing! That's the sweet spot.\"\n“S-So—”\n“Shut up and listen. When your feelings have matured to a certain extent through exchanging small favors, that's when it's time to confess.\"\nOuyang Mun looked thunderstruck and muttered.\n“Unbelievable. This… this is far deeper than the advice my seniors gave.”\n\"You sought advice from your seniors?\"\n“Yes. Actually, I only came back earlier because the seniors from the White Tortoise Corps told me to ‘act responsibly.’ They said I should appear to be a reliable man if I were to become a husband.”\n\"...\"\nAh.\nSo that’s why he’d rambled about responsibility.\nTrying to look like husband material?\n'What is this, the 1980s?... Oh, right, this is even further in the past.'\nJust as I was starting to feel a little uneasy, wondering if my modern advice was even effective here, Ouyang Mun asked another question.\n“But what if I show goodwill… and she still ignores me?”\n“Try two or three more times. If you still get nothing, or if she seems annoyed, you have to back off.\"\n\"How could you say such things! Miss Hayeon is the only one for me, Young Master!!\"\nWatching him spiral again, I thought,\nTruly, he had all the makings of an excellent stalker.\nThey say there's no tree that won't fall after ten strikes.\nThat’s if the tree didn’t call the police.\nIt's a romanticized notion perpetuated by one successful case, while the remaining ninety-nine are simply stalkers. If he believes himself to be among the one in a hundred, I'd rather suggest he buy a lottery ticket.\nAbove all.\n“Listen carefully. Unwanted ‘kindness’ is no different from harassment.\"\n“W-what do you mean? How can kindness be harassment?”\n\"Okay, just picture a woman you really can't stand. Someone you'd hate to be stuck with.\"\n\"???\"\nOuyang Mun stared blankly but soon nodded. \"Done.\"\n“Then, imagine that woman visiting you every day, bringing unwanted gifts each time, and even trying to kiss you. Would that make you happy or horrified?”\n\"!!!\"\nFinally, it clicked.\nHis face paled as if struck by lightning. It seemed he finally understood after putting on another person’s shoes.\nBut that was short-lived.\n\"Th-Then what do I do!? I-I can’t give up on Hayeon!\"\nI couldn’t help but sigh as he looked at me desperately as if he might cry at any moment.\nI decided to offer a carrot, as using only the stick might lead him to do something drastic.\n\"Like I said, chasing her one-sidedly is just harassment. So, you need to take a break from that and just be nice. Timing is crucial in romance. When someone's having a hard time or feeling lonely, their guard is down. That's when it's easier to get through to them. To seize that moment, you must be a friend first, not a suitor. I repeat, don't make her uncomfortable by showering her with gifts or showing up all the time.\"\n“Oh! It’s just like in martial arts! Using light feints to probe for openings, then striking when the guard drops! As expected, the saying 'All things return to one' isn't for nothing.”\nI nearly choked.\n‘We’re talking romance, and he pivots to combat strategy?’\nNo matter how you sliced it, this guy was a Demonic Cultist to the core.\n\"I am eternally grateful for your wisdom! From this day, I shall honor you as my second master!\" Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on novel⸺fire.net\nHe kowtowed dramatically.\n\"I asked you to assist the Young Master’s bath, not to grovel on the floor.\"\nJust then, Jin Hayeon walked back into Windrock Palace with servants in tow. She cast a cold glare at the prostrating Ouyang Mun.\nYep. His love life’s doomed.\nMore than half a month passed after that.\nOuyang Mun was leaving the cult's headquarters with his White Tortoise Corps. They'd been given a new mission.\nAs they journeyed, one of his seniors nudged him teasingly.\n\"So, Mun. How’d that advice pan out?\"\nThe seniors of the White Tortoise Corps, who had become close with Ouyang Mun after living and training together for more than a year, asked him with mischievous smiles.\nThese were the guys who'd given him love advice two weeks back.\n\"Haha. It's going well.\"\nOuyang Mun gave an answer that would have made Il-mok facepalm if he heard it.\n\"And I’ll no longer trouble you seniors for guidance. Hahaha!\"\nThe squad members froze, eyes widened.\n\"What?\"\n“Don't tell me, you already did the deed with her?”\n“Wha?! H-How can you talk about such a vulgar topic!\"\nOuyang Mun yelled at them like they were beneath him, so his seniors started whacking him playfully.\n“Oho? Starting to get cocky, are we?”\n“How dare you talk back to your seniors? Insolent brat!”\nAs they playfully roughed him up, Ouyang Mun was having a totally different thought.\n‘Master’s advice was right! The seniors’ guidance is useless!’\nAnd the master he was talking about wasn't his combat instructor. It was his dating coach, Il-mok.\n‘Slowly, steadily, show goodwill and wait for the right moment.’\nHe figured this actually worked out pretty well. As a member of the White Tortoise Corps, he was bound to frequently venture outside of the cult.\nHe could just bring her back a present every time he came back from a mission.\n‘Last time, I gifted her White Lotus Jade Ointment. Next, I’ll hunt for rare herbs or a spirit beast’s core.’\nIl-mok’s advice of going slow and steady had long been erased from Ouyang Mun’s mind.\n“Who knew losing one person could make things this quiet?”\nWith Ouyang Mun gone, the Windrock Palace returned to its previous tranquillity.\n\"Young Master. I've brought the snacks.\"\nWhile I was enjoying that peace, Jin Hayeon returned to the Windrock Palace holding a tray.\nSurprisingly, in just over a month, the fractures in her arm had completely healed.\n'No wonder it looked expensive. What kind of medicine was that?'\nNo matter how much I thought about it, the medicine Ouyang Mun had bought didn't seem like an ordinary remedy.\nIn any case, the Windrock Palace had returned to its original state.\nSeon-ah would come over while I was eating snacks, and I could just relax and spend my time studying or sparring with her and Jin Hayeon.\nJust as I was enjoying this peaceful atmosphere that had been rare lately.\n“Hahaha! Is my youngest brother here?!”\nNo sooner had one noisy fellow left than another noisy fellow appeared.\nAnd as soon as I heard that voice, Seon-ah flinched and clung to my side.\nI thought she was frightened, but judging by her eyes and sharpened nails, she seemed to be in battle mode. She seemed to be trying to protect me.\nMeanwhile, a familiar figure entered the Windrock Palace.\n\"Greetings to the Eldest Brother.\"\n\"Haha. I'm here today after concluding my closed-door meditation.\"\nThe person who visited the Windrock Palace was my Eldest Brother, who had been confined to the Closed Meditation Chamber for a month as punishment for his rampage.\nBut why did he come here immediately after ending his meditation?\n‘Does he still want to kill me!?’\nCold sweat dripped down my spine as I recalled our last encounter.\nHe might have decided to kill me since that time.\n\"There are many places I need to visit, but I came to see our most cherished youngest brother first.\"\n\"???\"\nCherised? Him?\nAs I reacted with confusion, my Eldest Brother added.\n\"That day, thanks to your advice, I was able to overcome the final wall to my Demonic Art. Hahaha. My Raging Demon Sword Art has reached the stage of Transcendence.”\n\"!!!\"\nWhile I was stunned by his revelation, it was Jin Hayeon who was the first to congratulate him.\n\"Congratulations, First Young Master.\"\nSeon-ah and I hastily followed suit.\n\"Congratulations, Eldest Brother. Does this mean… the rage is gone?\"\n\"Haha. Indeed. Want to test it?\"\n\"…….\"\nI'd already seen him go nuts once. There was no way in hell I was going to test that.\n\"Hahaha! Don't worry about it. Being called an idiot doesn't bother me anymore. It's just like you said, little brother: if I'm not smart enough, I just need to hire smart people to work for me!\"\n\"V-Very wise. Hahaha…\"\n\"So, after reaching Transcendence, I've been thinking. Who could I bring in as my direct subordinate to fulfil that role most brilliantly?\"\n\"Is that so?\"\nI asked him that with a bad feeling in my gut, wondering why he was telling me all this. For some reason, he looked super excited.\n\"Hehe. So, can you guess who I thought of?\"\n\"The Third Squad Leader maybe?\"\n\"Hahaha! Our younger brother is so humble! Haha! Of course, I thought of you, my junior brother. Who could be a better strategist than you!”\nThe story had taken such an abrupt turn that I could not help but show a dumbfounded reaction.\n\"Me?\"\nAll I want after finishing my studies is to eat, sleep, and laze around!",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 29 : Audit (2)",
    "content": "Chapter 29: Audit (2)\nWithout considering my feelings, Eldest Brother continued speaking with a foolish grin.\n“Of course, it’s still too early to say since our little brother hasn’t even completed the Hall of the Demonic Way yet, but I believe in you. I’m sure you’ll become a magnificent martial master in no time.”\nBut I had no desire to become one. An “outstanding martial master”?\nWhat a joke.\n\"Y-you flatter me, Eldest Brother. How could I possibly become your strategist?\"\n\"...I guess I'm just not a good enough leader for you, then. Seeing as how you're turning me down so firmly.\"\n\"!!!\"\nCold sweat ran down my back at Eldest Brother's murmured words of disappointment.\nThough he claims to have achieved Transcendence and can now control his anger, from my perspective, it sounded less like a statement and more like a threat that if I refused again, he would kill me.\n\"W-what are you saying! How could you be inadequate, Eldest Brother? I-I only said that because I'm not good enough.\"\n\"Hahaha! Don't worry about that! You're more than capable of being my strategist. But you do have a point. I haven't yet shown you that I'm worthy of being your lord! Hahaha! Just wait and see! I'll become a man worthy of your loyalty!\"\n\"...\"\nThis crazy boar wasn't even listening to a word I was saying.\nAnd having said his piece, he simply left Windrock Palace.\n\"......\"\nAs I wallowed in despair, sensing my life in this damned cult taking a sharp turn for the worse, Jin Hayeon chose that moment to pour oil on the fire.\n\"Congratulations, Young Master. It seems the First Young Master has properly recognized your abilities.\"\n\"Is this really something to celebrate?\"\n\"Of course it is. If the First Young Master becomes the next Heavenly Demon, he might appoint you either as the Left or Right Protector or even appoint you as the Chief Strategist.”\n\"Hah...\"\nA deep sigh escaped my lips.\nAnd misunderstanding my sigh, Jin Hayeon spouted more nonsense.\n\"Are you perhaps already conceiving of a plan to guide the First Young Master to the seat of the next Heavenly Demon?\"\nThough her question was absurd, I could roughly guess why she had made such a misconception.\nI learned this only after spending about a month in this damned cult, but being the Heavenly Demon’s disciple didn't automatically qualify one to inherit the position.\nOnce the current Heavenly Demon ascended, a race to become the next leader would begin within the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nThis competition is overseen by the Left and Right Protectors chosen by the previous Heavenly Demon, and there was only one minimum requirement to participate:\nVictory in combat against the Left and Right Protectors.\nThroughout generations, the Left and Right Protectors' positions were held by those who had mastered specific Demonic Arts passed down only to the Protectors.\nTo defeat either the Left or Right Protectors, one needed to master at least one of the highest-ranking Demonic Arts in the cult to the level of Transcendence.\nIn other words, even if you were a disciple of the Heavenly Demon, if you hadn’t mastered a high-level Demonic Art to Transcendence, you couldn’t aim for the position of the next Heavenly Demon.\nConversely, even if one wasn't the Heavenly Demon’s disciple, an exceptional master could aim for the position of the next Heavenly Demon.\nThe reason for adopting this system was simple. To learn the Heavenly Demon Divine Art, which symbolizes the Heavenly Demon, one must first master at least one advanced Demonic Art to the level of Transcendence.\nIt's a tradition they had to make because, while the Heavenly Demon Divine Art is the strongest, it also has the nastiest side effect.\nThe winner of this competition who learned the Heavenly Demon Divine Art is called the 'Cult Leader. ' Only when they, like Master, fully master the Heavenly Demon Divine Art and achieve Transcendence could they truly be called the 'Heavenly Demon.'\nWhen I finally heard this story from Jin Hayeon, I understood why the damned cult was run so haphazardly.\nFrom the moment a Heavenly Demon ascends, the cult enters a dark age lasting anywhere from a few years to several decades.\nThat's because all the top masters in the cult who've reached Transcendence start a bloody civil war to see who gets to be the next leader and learn the ultimate skill.\nEven after one becomes the Cult Leader through this internal war, the situation remains chaotic because you usually end up with a crazy person in charge because of the side effect.\nAnd if that leader dies from Qi Deviation without mastering the Heavenly Demon Divine Art, the whole war starts all over again.\nOnly when someone successfully masters the Heavenly Demon Divine Art can they escape this terrible era.\nJust like my Master.\nSo the cult's history is just this endless loop: a true Heavenly Demon like my master shows up, makes the cult great for a while, and then another dark age comes along. That's why the whole system is such a mess.\nIn any case, now that Eldest Brother had finally reached Transcendence with the Raging Demon Sword Art, he had finally qualified to compete for the position of the next Heavenly Demon.\nBut the cult already had a bunch of monsters like Hyeokryeon Cheongang running around. This meant Eldest Brother was merely a late contender.\nAnd so, Jin Hayeon had misunderstood my sigh, thinking I was contemplating strategies to help this late contender overtake those who had already qualified.\nBut I was just sad that my dream of living a carefree, unemployed bum life was getting further away.\n'Indeed, only Seon-ah truly understands my heart.'\nUnlike Jin Hayeon, who kept offering congratulations for whatever reason, Seon-ah was sighing along with me.\nThe place Wi Jin-hak visited after leaving the Windrock Palace was a familiar one to Il-mok.\nEntering the estate marked with the characters Hyeokryeon, Wi Jin-hak met privately with a certain man in the innermost hall.\n\"It's been a while, Family Head.\"\n\"Indeed it has, First Young Master.\"\nAs they exchanged greetings, Hyeokryeon Cheongang was quite surprised inside.\n\"Looks like you've had a major breakthrough recently.\"\n\"Hahaha. It was thanks to my youngest brother.\"\n\"Oh...\"\nA sigh containing various emotions escaped Hyeokryeon Cheongang's lips.\nLooking at the Hyeokryeon Family Head, Wi Jin-hak spoke.\n\"Actually, I came here personally to apologize for the previous incident. Though Master has already punished me, I felt it proper to visit and apologize myself.\"\n\"We have already decided not to make an issue of that incident, so you need not pay it any mind.\"\nEven as he gave this reply, Hyeokryeon Cheongang was lost in various thoughts.\n'He truly has achieved Transcendence in the Raging Demon Sword Art.'\nHe had changed significantly in just that one month. In the past, he would have been unable to contain his anger at being insulted, yet now he came to apologize instead.\n'And on top of that, he says it was because of the youngest disciple.'\nNaturally, Hyeokryeon Cheongang's thoughts turned to Il-mok.\nAt first, he merely watched over him because of the Heavenly Demon's order.\nBut after the youngest disciple's direct visit to the clan, his granddaughter had changed.\nAnd in a very positive direction.\nSince that day, his granddaughter had been voluntarily immersing herself in martial arts.\nIt had been painfully obvious before that she was only following the family's orders out of obligation. The change was so profound that it could be called a metamorphosis.\nHe still found it annoying that she went to see that youngest disciple for two hours every day, but aside from that time, she spent all her time in the family compound, focused on martial arts training or studying.\nGiven her already outstanding talent, her rate of growth was truly remarkable.\nAnd now, even the First Young Master claimed to have reached Transcendence thanks to that youngest disciple, causing Hyeokryeon Cheongang's opinion of Il-mok to shift somewhat positively.\nHowever, he still didn't know exactly why his granddaughter had changed so dramatically.\nLate at night.\nIn a corner of the vast estate at the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's main headquarters.\nThree men gathered in the darkness to hold a meeting.\nAs always, it was a meeting to discuss various matters occurring within the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, but—\nToday's topic inevitably centered on First Young Master Wi Jin-hak, who had emerged from his punishment several days ago.\n\"You must have all heard the news. That dim-witted First Young Master has finally mastered the Raging Demon Sword Art and reached Transcendence.\"\n\"Although we anticipated this risk since there's still time before the Heavenly Demon's ascension, I never expected him to achieve Transcendence so suddenly.\"\nThough their faces were hidden in darkness, they all spoke in equally serious tones.\nThe conversation primarily focused on predicting Wi Jin-hak's future moves and how to deal with them.\n\"While preparation is wise, we needn't overreact about this. Not only might that risk exposing our activities, but he's merely a novice who was barely qualified.\"\n\"However, being the Heavenly Demon's eldest disciple means gaining qualification alone puts him in an advantageous position. If the Heavenly Demon throws his support behind his eldest disciple before departing, it will inevitably work against us.\"\n\"Hmm. Ultimately, we must carefully observe how the Heavenly Demon treats the First Young Master.\"\nAs the discussion on this topic was coming to a close, the man on the right cautiously spoke.\n\"By the way, have you all heard that rumor?\"\n\"Rumor? What rumor?\"\n\"There's talk that the youngest disciple played a crucial role in helping the First Young Master achieve Transcendence.\"\n\"......\"\nThe other two fell silent, indicating they hadn't heard this.\nThen the man on the left tilted his head and muttered.\n\"Wasn't it because of that youngest disciple that the First Young Master went berserk?\"\n\"It's already a widespread rumor within the Cult that the youngest disciple provoked the First Young Master by relentlessly saying things he hated the most.\" The source of this content ɪs novel⟡fire.net\nIl-mok's constant provocation of the berserk Wi Jin-hak couldn't help but become a widespread topic.\nThis was inevitable since dozens of people who had come to stop the berserk Wi Jin-hak had all heard the youngest disciple taunting the First Young Master.\n\"Hah. We stopped paying attention because we figured they were mortal enemies now.\"\n\"I can't believe they had some other meeting in between all that.\"\n\"We should verify whether this rumor is true or not.\"\nAt the central figure's words, the men on both sides nodded.\nIf the rumor was false, there was no need to pay it mind. They weren't free enough to waste their time on some powerless kid because of gossip.\nBut what if the rumor was true?\nThe kid was already smart enough to change the entire cult system by talking to the Heavenly Demon, and now he'd pulled off something as huge as giving the First Disciple a breakthrough.\nHe might be young, but he was a dangerous element who could greatly influence their grand plan.\nIf a guy like that teamed up with the First Young Master, their own plans could fall apart.\n\"If the rumor proves true, we'll put the youngest disciple under surveillance. Make sure we can spot a chance to... take him out, whenever we need to.\"\nThe man in the center declared with a mix of killing intent in his tone.\nA few days passed.\nDuring my usual training session with Master, he suddenly asked me something.\n\"How are your preparations for the Hall of the Demonic exam coming along?\"\nThe question triggered a sense of familiarity within me and before I could answer, Jin Hayeon cut in, \"He's already finished the Secret Record of the Heavenly Demon for his morning studies, and he's almost done with the historical records. At this rate, we can reduce morning study time and focus more on martial arts training. Also, his progress in martial arts is rapidly increasing.\"\n\"Hmm. It seems there won't be major issues with the entrance examination.\"\n\"Indeed. Your esteemed self had mentioned that you would bestow the Explosive Demon Pill upon Young Master Il-mok later as well, so entrance is assured, and in my personal opinion, entering the Upper Class from the start should be possible.\"\nThe Hall of the Demonic Way selects only twenty individuals each year through examinations. And they split those twenty by their test scores into two classes: Upper Class and Bottom Class.\nHahaha. Making it into the Upper Class after only a year of preparation. He truly possesses outstanding talent.\"\n“All thanks to your discerning eye, Supreme One, for discovering him.”\nWhy did praise for my efforts always circle back to the Master’s greatness? But a bigger issue loomed.\n'Hang on, I feel like I've been through this before.'\nAnd my ominous prediction wasn't wrong.\n\"Since it seems we have some time to spare, I have a task for you, Il-mok.\"\n\"Ha, hahaha. Shouldn't we focus on entrance preparation just in case?\"\n\"Don't worry. After you complete this task, I'll personally make time to give you some extra training, just like last time.\"\nHe was saying he would work me like a dog again, just like last time.\nAnd seeing this old-fashioned geezer present it as if he were bestowing some reward, I had no choice but to give up.\n\"Ha. Hahaha. Come to think of it, we do seem to have plenty of time. There's n-no need for my busy Master to allocate additional time. But may I ask what kind of task it is, Master?\"\nI tried to turn down his \"prize,\" but he just took it as me being humble and smiled.\n\"As you suggested before, we've started opening schools and providing education at the cult's branches throughout Xinjiang. So, shouldn't you verify with your eyes whether each branch is operating exactly as you planned?\"\nIn other words, he was telling me to go on another business trip.\nAnd as a field auditor, no less.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 30 : Audit (3)",
    "content": "Chapter 30: Audit (3)\n'Audit, huh….'\nAs a former civil servant, this was somewhat familiar work.\nIt was a task implemented to prevent corruption, bribery, and illegal activities, but ironically, it was also the kind of work most conducive to committing those very acts.\n'They say that's how they used to make money back then.'\nThese were tales that were a far cry from my work in the Social Welfare Department, but I heard plenty of stories about those dirty deeds. Things like bribing the official in charge to get away with illegal extensions or illegal constructions or allocating ridiculously large sums for outsourcing program development, far exceeding the quality of the final product.\nThe officials in charge were supposed to monitor them to prevent such things, but turning a blind eye in exchange for backdoor deals was practically a protocol at that time.\n'If it's that bad with the internet and everything, I can't even imagine how bad it is in this backward era.'\nAnd this place was an era so ancient it could not even be compared to the 'back in my day' stories I used to hear from my seniors in my days as Seo Jihun.\nThe chances of getting caught for corruption, wrongdoing, or illegal activities were practically nil compared to modern times.\n'Should I try to make some money off this opportunity?'\nJust as a sleazy smile was about to form on my face at that thought—\n\"What's got you so deep in thought?\"\nMaster's voice snapped me out of my wayward thoughts.\n\"Hahaha. I was just worried that I might make mistakes.\"\n\"Hahaha. You are more than capable of handling this, so don't worry.\"\nHis benevolent smile made cold sweat trickle down my back.\n'Though the chances of getting caught are low, who knows what they'd do to me if I were caught.'\nHe's smiling like a nice grandpa now, but at the end of the day, he's the leader of a cult filled with psychos.\nMoreover...\n'Now that I think about it, what is there to even take?'\nThere were plenty of ways to embezzle.\nI could just go to a branch office and threaten them with something like submitting a negative report to Master and they would naturally bow down and bring me all sorts of offerings.\nBut...\n'What would I get? Some fancy food and booze at best. Maybe some gold and jewels.'\nPrecious metals and jewelery.\nWhen I was Seo Ji-hoon, those words would have made my eyes spin.\n'But do I... really need them?'\nThanks to my position as the Heavenly Demon's disciple, I already had a personal maid attending to my needs all day, providing me with three meals a day and even taking care of my sleeping quarters.\nAt least while living in the cult, the status of the Heavenly Demon's disciple alone was more than enough to live idly.\nNo wonder they say fair pay stops corruption.\nOf course, it was annoying that I had to run around because I was the Heavenly Demon’s disciple, but...\n'If I take the money and run, I'll probably spend the rest of my life being hunted by this damned cult.'\nIt was a future too horrifying to even imagine.\nThe people who now doted on me calling me \"Young Master\" or \"Brother\" would turn into crazed cultists with bloodshot eyes while hunting me down.\n\"Since Master says so, I'll do my best.\"\nMeaning, I’ll do this thankless task. Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn novel{f}ire.net\n'Rather than a business trip, I should think of it as a vacation and take it easy.'\nIt was a terrible mindset for an auditor.\nA few days later.\nI boarded a carriage and departed the cult’s headquarters.\nHowever, I wasn't heading to Aksu County where I had visited last time.\nMy Master insisted that I needed a deeper understanding of the cult’s affairs and assigned me a destination much farther away.\nHe wanted me to see and experience it firsthand, saying the atmosphere would be quite different from Aksu County, which was close to headquarters.\n'Damn old geezer.'\nHe seemed desperate to work his disciple to the bone.\nUnaware of my inner thoughts, Jin Hayeon, who was riding in the carriage with me, spoke with a serious expression.\n\"It seems the Heavenly Demon truly believes in your potential, Young Master Il-mok. Why else would he give you the mission of checking out a place so far away so you can understand the cult better?\"\nShe always maintained a cold attitude, yet when it came to matters concerning Master, her eyes suddenly had a rose-tinted filter.\n\"Do you truly believe he sent me all the way to Hejing (和靜) because he trusts me?\"\n\"Of course! If he didn't trust you, wouldn't he have accompanied you?\"\nShe had a point. Unlike the last trip, Master wasn't accompanying us on this long journey.\n'Alright. Since there's no surveillance from Master, I should think of it as a vacation and — '\nBut before my thought could finish, the carriage suddenly stopped.\n\"What's going on?\" I called out.\nThe two guards assigned by my Master for this journey replied in unison.\n\"Young Master. From here on, you must dismount the carriage and follow it using the lightness skill.\"\n“This is the Heavenly Demon’s sacred decree.”\n\"...\"\nSo this wasn’t about trust. It was about exploiting me without lifting a finger himself.\nIf I were an auditor meant to assess the situation of each branch, these warriors were there to monitor me.\n\"Huff... huff...\"\nJust as my breathing was reaching its limit and I was starting to stagger—\n\"Hyah!\"\nThe carriage running beside me came to a stop.\nI climbed back into the carriage with routines that had now become familiar.\nOn the last trip, I didn't know how to use internal energy, so what I called lightness skill was nothing more than mimicking the movements while running just like usual. Obviously, I couldn't keep up with the carriage.\nBut now that I knew how to use internal energy, I could actually perform lightness skill and run at a speed comparable to the carriage.\nOf course, since my internal energy was still modest, I could only manage roughly about one hour's distance at a time.\n'This is only possible because it's a Demonic Art.'\nMaster had said that the amount of internal energy gathered in my dantian would be equivalent to about five years of power accumulated by the standards of the unbelievers in the Central Plains.\nIn other words, it would take five years for others to gather that much using the Qi Absorption Technique, the simplest and purest breathing method, while I accumulated that amount in just under four months.\nAs I caught my breath while experiencing the terrifying effectiveness of Demonic Art—\n“Breathe and circulate your energy, Young Master.”\nI sighed and crossed my legs into the lotus position.\nCirculating energy in a violently shaking carriage running at full speed was something that I was already used to, thanks to the last time. But my sigh stemmed from another reason.\n'Once my internal energy recovers, I have to run again, don't I?'\nI had already repeated this insanity four times. How many more times would I have to run until we reached our destination?\n'I should drag this out as much as possible.'\nI did my breathing exercises as slowly as I possibly could, taking in huge breaths but only gathering my energy bit by bit.\nEven with me dragging my feet on purpose, my tiny little dantian filled up way too fast.\n'Let's hold out a bit longer.'\nI faked a few more exaggerated breaths, pretending to still be meditating—until the guards’ voices cut through the act.\n\"Young Master. We know your dantian is already full.\"\n“If you keep this up, we’ll have no choice but to report to the Heavenly Demon.”\n\"Sigh.\"\nHeaving a deep sigh, I reluctantly got up and stepped out of the carriage.\n'I'll get you back for this.'\nI'm your cult leader's disciple, you bastards.\nHow much time had passed as I was bossed around by mere guards?\nBy the time the sun dipped low, we arrived at a village. Not our final destination Hejing County, but Kuqa County.\nThe distance from the cult’s headquarters at the Tianshan Mountain Range to Hejing County was a ridiculously long distance of over 400 kilometers.\nUnless one was a master who had reached the pinnacle of lightness skill or rode a horse worthy of being called a thousand-li horse like Red Hare, it was an impossible distance to reach in a single day in this era.\nThat’s why we planned to rest at Kuqa County, a county located about halfway between the Tianshan Mountain Range and Hejing County.\nOf course, this county also housed a branch of the cult.\nSince we were going all the way to Hejing County, we were also scheduled to conduct an audit in Kuqa County.\nThe schedule and route had been planned with this in mind from the start.\nAs the dusk fell, villagers wrapped up their work and headed home. We headed not to the cult’s branch in this county, but to the only inn available.\nThe reason was simple.\nOur great Master had ordered us to conceal our identities for the field audit.\nHe said we wouldn't be able to see their usual state if we announced our arrival and visited as auditors.\n'He's unnecessarily meticulous about things like this.'\nWhile mentally criticizing Master, the carriage stopped again.\n\"Hup.\"\nWhen the carriage stopped, my body tensed reflexively, thinking I needed to use lightness skill.\nBut then I belatedly realized there was no need for it now since we had stopped at our destination.\n\"Damn it.\"\nI felt like one of Pavlov’s dogs, conditioned to run at the sound of brakes.\nI dragged my worn-out body, drenched in sweat and all, and stepped down from the carriage and entered the inn with Jin Hayeon and the two guards in tow.\nHowever, we weren't greeted by the innkeeper's voice.\nConfused, I looked around and saw a middle-aged man who resembled the owner, talking to his child.\n“Sam Pyeong! If you don’t study now, you’ll forget everything!”\n\" Hng . I don't want to study.\"\nA kid who hates studying and a parent trying to force them. It was a scene I'd seen a million times.\n\"Hey brat, do you know what kind of opportunity this is?! You need to learn while the cult members are willing to teach! Your old man never had anyone to teach him when he was a kid, so I barely learned to read at all!\"\n\"But Dad, you're living well even without knowing how to read.\"\n\"It's because I don't know how to read that I'm doing this hard work! And because I don't know how to read, I named my son something as simple as Sam Pyeong! Because I’m crude and uneducated!\"\nThough the father was practically shouting at his child, his heartfelt desire for his son's well-being was clear.\n“That’s why you have to seize this chance the cult’s given us! Study while they’re willing to teach!”\nAnd for whatever reason, hearing him praise the cult like that made Jin Hayeon and the guards next to me get these smugly satisfied expressions on their faces.\n\"It's just like Young Master Il-mok said. Opening these schools is really doing a lot to boost the faith of the followers.\"\n\"...\"\nThe idea to establish schools had been something I’d concocted to offload work onto others.\n\"Ahem.\"\nFeeling awkward, I cleared my throat loudly, which finally made the dad and son look over at us.\n\"Oh! Welcome! I'm so sorry, I didn't even see you come in.\"\n\"Hahaha. It's alright. Could you prepare two rooms and some dinner for us?\"\n\"Yes! I'll prepare them quickly!\"\n\"Hmm. And could you also prepare bath water?\"\nAt my request, the innkeeper spoke cautiously.\n\"Well... bath water costs quite a bit, would that be alright?\"\nXinjiang wasn't a region with abundant water.\nGetting enough to drink or wash your face was one thing, but getting enough for a full-body soak was going to cost you.\nBut I was so caked in grime that there was no way I was skipping a bath.\n\"Don't worry about money, we have plenty.\"\nI said so while shaking the money pouch that had been given to me before I left headquarters.\nThe man’s face brightened at the sight.\nEarly the next morning.\nWe finished our breakfast at the inn and then departed.\nDespite being worked like a dog yesterday, I was fine except for being a little tired.\n'Man, this body is ridiculously tough.'\nNo wonder Master had his eye on me. Damn it.\nAs we wandered the village, I saw people wearing clothes embroidered with the character for 'Demon' (魔) doing odd jobs here and there.\nIt was the cult members from the local branch who were helping out the villagers.\n\"Hmm. Looks like the part where our men help the locals so the kids can go to school is working just fine.\"\nWe looked around the village for a bit, pretending to be just some random travelers, and then headed for the cult branch.\nA small makeshift space had been set up next to the branch office. That was the temporary school where children were taught.\nSince we were conducting the audit incognito, I couldn't observe the class directly, so I cautiously approached the temporary academy building.\n\"Now, listen and repeat after me! The sea is salty, the river is fresh (海鹹河淡)!\"\n\"The sea is salty, the river is fresh!\"\n\"Now, what does this mean~\"\nThrough the paper window, the voices of the teacher and children studying could be heard.\n\"The first character is 'sea,' and the second character is 'salty,' so it means the sea is salty. And the third character is 'river,' the last is 'fresh,' so the river is fresh! In short, it means the sea is salty and the river is fresh!\"\n\"Teacher! What's the sea~?\"\n\"What does the sea look like?\"\n\"And why does the character for river (河) look like that?\"\nBecause they were all little kids, the moment the teacher finished talking, they all started talking at once.\n\"Quiet! Quiet down!\"\n\"Teacher! Is the sea really salty?\"\n\"No way! How can water be salty?\"\n\"Maybe they put salt in it!\"\n\"Salt is too expensive to put in water!\"\n\"The sea must be really small!\"\n\"Quiet, quiet!! The sea is a hu~ge body of water! Much bigger than a river!\"\nThe teacher's voice boomed out, rising above the children's chattering.\nBut the children, as expected, were clueless.\n\"No way!!\"\n\"How can they make something bigger than a river salty?\"\n\"There must be lots of salt!!\"\n\"Idiot! Dad told me salt is super expensive!\"\n\"Hmph! You've never even eaten salt! I have~!\"\nThe kids kept on squabbling for another minute.\nJust when I was wondering why the teacher had gone quiet—\n\"YOU BRATS!!!\"\nA shout infused with internal energy erupted.\nAt the same time, killing intent and demonic energy began to surge from within the schoolhouse.\nOnly then did I realize I had forgotten one very important issue.\nThe martial artists of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult cultivated Demonic Arts. Naturally, the martial artists of the branch office would also be cultivating Demonic Arts.\nAnd those damned fuckers suffer from mental illness as a side effect of their Demonic Arts.\nIn other words—\nI'd handed over a bunch of first-graders to be taught by a bunch of lunatics.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 31 : Audit (4)",
    "content": "Chapter 31: Audit (4)\nIn my defense, I had my reasons.\nThe only Branch Leader I'd ever met was Ma Gang-il, the Branch Leader of Aksu County.\nAnd Ma Gang-il's side effect was, at worst, mania.\nI thought that if the side effect was just becoming increasingly cheerful and prone to booming laughter, I figured he'd be fine around kids.\nBut on second thought, there was no reason to assume that the leaders of every branch would have practiced the same Demonic Arts as Ma Gang-il.\nMoreover...\n'I forgot how infuriating it can be to deal with dozens of children!'\nEven normal people often lose their minds from stress when dealing with children, so how could I forget that actual lunatics wouldn't stand a chance?\nBut now wasn't the time to be regretting that. ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NoveIꜰire.net\nBANG!\n\"Calm down!!\"\nI burst through the door and shouted, trying to prevent the children from being massacred.\nThe eyes of all the children gathered in the academy focused on me. And of course, so did the gaze of the headmaster, who was practically leaking demonic energy and bloodlust.\n“How dare you disrupt the sacred rites of the Divine Cult!”\nPerhaps because he had already started to lose control, the deranged Branch Leader immediately shouted and charged at me through the crowd of children.\nWaves of killing intent and demonic energy washed over me.\nBut to me, who had barely begun learning Demonic Art less than four months ago, the murderous aura of this middle-aged demonic cultivator…\nFelt laughably trivial.\nFrom my Master to the senior brothers... I had been blasted with the killing intents of masters of entirely different calibers. This level of killing intent barely registered in my mind.\nYou could say my guts had grown disproportionate to my actual skill.\nSWOOSH!\nIn an instant, the Branch Leader drew the saber at his waist and swung it as he closed in.\nStrangely, I could see all of his movements clearly.\nAnd obviously, I wasn't about to get hit by an attack I could see coming a mile away.\nCLANG!\nIn a flash, I drew my sword using the Soul-Departing Sword, while incorporating the Soul-Guiding Sword to deflect the Branch Leader's first attack.\n\"Ugh.\"\nBut even though I'd redirected his blow, the sheer gap in our power left my sword arm screaming in protest.\nI decisively retreated, using the principles of Soul-Cutting Flash to keep the Branch Leader at bay with concise thrusts.\nCLANG!\nCLANG!\nI parried the Branch Leader’s wild, boar-like slashes while backing away step by step.\n\"Die!!\"\nThe Branch Leader had finally closed in on me and swung his saber, but there was no need to retreat any further.\nI had made it past the narrow entrance of the hall and out onto the wide road.\n\"How dare you!\"\nAnd as the Branch Leader chased me out of the school, Jin Hayeon and the two guards launched their attack.\n\"Don't kill him!\"\nEven without my order, it seemed the three had no intention of killing. Instead, they swiftly targeted his pressure points and immobilized him.\n\"You dare attack me in my own branch of the Divine Cult! You think you'll walk away from this alive?!\"\nWith his pressure points blocked, the immobilized Branch Leader just kept screaming bloody murder.\nBut he had chosen the wrong opponent to scream at.\n\"You're the one who dared to swing a sword at this person without knowing who they are!\"\nJin Hayeon cut in and immediately reached into her sleeve to pull out some kind of token.\n\"This person is the Eighth Disciple of the Supreme One, Young Master Il-mok.\"\nThe moment he saw the token, the Branch Leader's attitude completely changed.\n\"Hiiik...\"\nHis face went from beet-red with fury to ghost-white with fear.\n\"This lowly one had committed a grave sin! Please kill me!!\"\nThe man looked like he was about to start crying, but he wasn't begging me to spare him. He was begging me to execute him like the true cultist he is.\nI thought I was getting used to the Demonic Cult, but I don't think I'll ever get used to seeing that.\nJust then, the children from the school rushed out and stood between us and the Branch Leader.\n\"Leave our headmaster alone!\"\n\"Stop being mean to him!\"\nFor some reason, the headmaster's face turned even darker at the children's actions.\nAfter watching this scene for a moment, I let out a sigh and said, “Let’s move to the branch headquarters first. Release his pressure points.”\nTogether with Jin Hayeon, the two escorts, and the Branch Leader, I entered the branch headquarters.\nThe Branch Leader's utterly dejected attitude was akin to that of a teacher who had been caught doing something wrong by a visiting school inspector.\n\"Teaching children is harder than you thought, isn't it?\"\n“No! It's all because I'm worthless! Please kill me, for I have failed to properly handle even a simple task given by the Heavenly Demon!\"\nIt's not like I'm some Joseon Dynasty executioner, so why does he keep asking me to kill him?\nBut since trying to calm him down nicely wasn't working, I switched tactics.\n\"How do you conduct your classes?\"\n\"Do you give them breaks?\"\n\"How many characters do you teach per day?\"\nOnly after I bombarded him with questions about his teaching methods did the Branch Leader start answering properly.\nAfter grasping the current teaching methods, I gave him a few instructions.\n\"First, if there's a child who doesn't follow the Branch Leader's instructions during class, give them one warning, and if they still don't comply, send them home.\"\n\"!? H-How can I defy the Heavenly Demon's order and send a child home?\"\n\"I am not telling you to send them away for good. It's a warning. A warning aimed at the children's parents. When I checked last night, all the parents were overjoyed that their children could learn to read. So, what do you think would happen if you told them their child was expelled from the school for being disobedient?\"\nIn modern times, they might cause an uproar, saying, 'Who are you to discriminate against our child?' But this place was different.\n\"They'd probably come crying and begging us to forgive them, right? Either that or the kid would get a serious beating at home.\"\n\"Exactly. There's no need for you to give in to your anger. You just have to do your job. Warn them that you'll send them home, and if that doesn't work, just send them home. And when the parents come begging for forgiveness, just say you'll let it slide this once and continue teaching the child.\"\n\"Ah!!\"\nThe Branch Leader finally seemed to understand my intention, letting out a gasp of admiration.\n\"As expected of the Supreme One’s disciple! Such wisdom!!\"\nI waved off the Branch Leader's unnecessary flattery.\nI wasn't exactly thrilled with this solution myself. All it really did was pass the buck for punishment onto the parents.\nIt's just that...\n'It’s better than letting these lunatics do it. I don’t want to imagine what might happen if, by chance, these lunatics fall into Qi Deviation while disciplining the children. So this is the only way.’\nIt was a second-best solution to avoid the worst-case scenario.\nAnd of course, these measures alone wouldn't solve all the problems.\n\"Children’s attention spans have limits. Don't try to force-feed them too much information. It'll only make things harder for you.\"\n\"Then, how much would be appropriate?\"\n“Aim for just eight characters a day. You’ve got a whole year to teach the Thousand Character Classic, and at that rate, you’ll be done in about four months.”\nTo give you an idea, the Thousand Character Classic is basically a long poem made up of 250 four-character lines, totaling a thousand characters.\nBasically, I was telling him to teach just two lines a day.\n\"You don't even need to teach two lines at once. Teach one line at a time, and when the children have somewhat understood and memorised it, give them a break. It's fine to let them play during break time. Then, after they've calmed down somewhat, you can teach the second line.\"\n\"I understand, Young Master.\"\n“Patience is key. Never lose your temper with them. Do you understand?\"\nI emphasized the point forcefully.\nEven now, I still get cold sweats thinking about it.\nThe thought that children all over Xinjiang might be dying or being crippled by the Demonic Cult members because of the school program I'd suggested to Master out of laziness chilled my spine.\n\"It seems quite late, so you may leave now.\"\n\"By your command!!\"\nDespite the lengthy lecture, the Branch Leader bowed to me with a moved expression and hurriedly left.\n\"Bring me a brush, ink, and paper.\"\nThen I gave instructions to Jin Hayeon, who had been standing by.\nAs soon as Jin Hayeon brought the writing materials, Il-mok began writing furiously on the paper.\n'The class schedule and pace need to be adjusted to the children's level.’\n'The instructors need to be changed too. Exclude those who have learned Demonic Arts related to anger or depression, and choose those with mania like Branch Leader Ma Gang-il, or those lacking emotions like Jin Hayeon, as they're less likely to harm the children.'\nHe jotted down the problems he'd observed while touring the area and branch headquarters, along with potential solutions.\nBut even as he wrote, Il-mok didn’t feel good about any of it.\nIt wasn't just guilt over nearly getting a bunch of kids killed, either.\nThoughts like 'This should be enough' and 'This is probably sufficient, it's becoming troublesome' did cross his mind.\nHowever—\n—It's not perfect yet!\n—What about this other scenario? You need to be more prepared!\n...another voice started nagging at the back of his head.\nIt was the moment when the side effect of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword kicked in.\nSwish.\nAnd just like that, Il-mok was lost in it again, searching for more solutions, his hand moving the brush nonstop.\nAs Il-mok buried himself in his work, Jin Hayeon, who was watching from behind, discreetly sent a voice transmission to the two bodyguards.\n— We’re intruding now. Withdraw.\nThe guards nodded and quietly slipped out.\nJust to be safe, Jin Hayeeon and the two bodyguards stood guard by the door.\nPerhaps bored with the endless wait.\nOne of the two guard named Jang Hwi asked Jin Hayeon.\n\"By the way, is it true that the Young Master has been learning martial arts for less than four months?\"\n\"That's correct.\"\n“No prior experience?”\n“None.”\nThe guard’s eyes lit up in interest at her answer.\n\"Oh my. To think that's the level of skill he achieved after only four months.\"\nThough it was brief, Il-mok had managed to hold his own in a fight against the Branch Leader.\nOf course, all three of them present were stronger than the Branch Leader. He was at best a leader among low-ranking warriors, a far cry from those who had graduated from the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nHowever, he was still a man who had trained in Demonic Art for decades into his middle age. The fact that Il-mok had withstood his attacks alone was a testament to his remarkable talent.\nTo Jang Hwi’s reaction, Jin Hayeon spoke in a tone uncharacteristically filled with pride.\n\"Young Master Il-mok's talent for martial arts is remarkable, but his strategic mind is even more impressive.\"\n\"Strategic mind, you say.\"\n\"Even now, based on the brief audit this morning, he's writing down such a long document without rest.\"\nTo Jin Hayeon's praise, the other escort Kwan Mu-yeol, frowned and said.\n\"Hmm. Having many opinions isn't necessarily a good thing. What matters is whether they truly benefit the Divine Cult.\"\n“You’re too rigid,” Jang Hwi countered.\nJin Hayeon interjected into the conversation between Kwan Mu-yeol and Jang Hwi.\n\"I agree with Warrior Kwan’s words. Indeed, having many opinions isn't necessarily good. However, I believe Young Master Il-mok will be different. Just watch and see.\"\nFor some reason, her face was filled with pride, just like when discussing the Heavenly Demon.\nBy the time Il-mok finished his work, it was already time for the children to go home.\n'Damn side effect.'\nThanks to his modern-day memories mixing with the side effect of his Demonic Art, Il-mok had been stuck in a loop, endlessly dumping ideas onto paper until he barely managed to snap out of it.\nBut just because the kids left didn't mean he was going back to the inn he had stayed at yesterday.\nNow that his cover was blown and he’d dealt with the mess, Il-mok decided to spend the day shamelessly letting the Branch Leader wait on him hand and foot.\n\"Young Master, is the food to your liking?\"\n\"Oh my, haha. It is to my liking, but my arm, the one that blocked your saber earlier, is throbbing. I think I need to eat more meat to heal my muscles.\"\n\"Hiiik...\"\nWhen Il-mok answered while massaging his right arm, the Branch Leader's face turned pale as he hurriedly went to procure meat from somewhere.\n\"Oh dear. The back of my neck that almost got cut off feels cold. I think it would be nice to warm up in some hot~ water.\"\nNo sooner had Il-mok's words ended than bathwater hot enough to be mistaken for a hot spring appeared.\nThis wasn’t hospitality. This was extortion.\nAfter observing this scene for a moment, the escorting warrior Kwan Mu-yeol frowned and spoke.\n“Young master. It is wrong for a disciple of the Heavenly Demon to take advantage of a subordinate’s weakness like this. If you continue like this, I will have no choice but to report to the Supreme One.\"\n\"Ah, is that so?\"\nFor some reason, the guard’s lecture just made Il-mok grin crookedly.\n“Well, you know. I guess I’m just a little cranky from getting hurt and having to pull my own sword and fight even though my bodyguards were right here.”\n“...That was because you charged in alone.”\n“Ah, perfect. I’ll be sure to add that to my report to Master then. That I almost died because I acted alone despite having escort warriors with me. Hahahaha.\"\n\"…….\"\nThe two bodyguards stared at Il-mok, who was grinning like he’d just won the lottery. Then, they both slowly turned to look at Jin Hayeon.\n‘Is that the man you told us to wait and see?’\nShe shut her eyes, refusing to acknowledge their stares.",

    "content": "Chapter 32: Recruitment (1)\nEarly the next morning.\n“Safe travels, Young Master.”\n\"Hahaha. Thank you for your hard work, Branch Leader. An official directive regarding the school will likely come down in a few days, so please hold on until then.”\n“Y-yes, of course! Hahaha!”\nAfter exchanging pleasantries with Il-mok, with whom he had grown closer after exchanging hospitality, the Branch Leader of Kuqa County bid his farewell.\n\"Hya!\"\nKwan Mu-yeol spurred his horse, and the carriage departed from Kuqa County, heading toward Hejing County.\nWatching the departing carriage from the village entrance, the Kuqa County Branch Leader thought to himself.\n‘…I feel like I forgot to tell him something important.’\nHe'd been so flustered by Il-mok's veiled threats that his mind had been a mess.\nAnd soon, the Branch Leader realized what he had forgotten and lightly shrugged his shoulders.\n‘Hmm. They're the disciple of the Supreme One and his appointed escorts, so there shouldn't be any major problems.’\nUnlike our tense prior journey, I lounged lazily in the carriage after enjoying Kuqa County’s generous accommodations.\n\"Young Master. It's time for your lightness skill training.\"\nThe warriors, who couldn't stand seeing me relax, spoke up, but...\n“Oh dear, my muscles are still sore from yesterday's injury. I feel stiff all over.”\n“It didn't seem that serious.”\n“Well, you see, a while back I tore a muscle stopping my Eldest Brother from going berserk, and I think it’s acting up again. Hahaha. I thought I'd have someone to protect me, but it looks like that didn't quite work out.”\n\"......\"\nAs soon as I mentioned how I’d almost been killed by the Branch Leader's rampage yesterday, the warriors became as silent as clams.\nThanks to that, I was able to travel comfortably in the carriage, half-dozing off, until...\n\"Young Master.\"\nI sighed and woke up to Warrior Jang Hwi’s call, but before I could respond to him, Kwan Mu-yeol's voice cut in.\n\"Don't leave the carriage.\"\n\"???\"\n\"Bandits are approaching.\"\n\"!?\"\nI pulled back the carriage curtain with an incredulous expression and looked outside.\nAs Kwan Mu-yeol had said, a group was approaching, kicking up sand and dust.\nIt was an absurd situation.\n‘Bandits in Xinjiang are actually trying to rob a disciple of the Heavenly Demon??’\nThis was like a bunch of lunatics trying to mug an asylum full of bigger lunatics.\nIt didn't take long for me to figure out why.\n'Right. We're currently hiding our identities.'\nThe carriage we were riding in didn't display any flags or emblems related to the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nThough unintended, we had somehow set up a trap for ourselves.\nHaving reached this conclusion, I watched the approaching bandits with a complex expression on my face.\n“They're walking right into their own graves.”\nFor some reason, my two bodyguards didn't try to outrun them, nor did they attack the bandits until they were right next to the carriage.\n“Are you waiting for the bandits on purpose?” Newest update provıded by novelFirｅ.net\nWhen I questioned their behavior, Kwan Mu-yeol answered in his blunt tone.\n\"We're waiting for them to get closer.\"\n\"Is there really a need for that?\"\nIt was hard to say it was for my protection. Even if they went out, Jin Hayeon would still be with me, and if my safety was the top priority, running away would have been the right thing to do.\nAnd my doubts were resolved thanks to the answers from Kwan Mu-yeol and Jang Hwi.\n\"These vermin dared commit crimes in the Divine Cult’s territory; we won't let a single one escape.”\n“When they get close, we’ll cripple their horses in a surprise attack. Then, we'll slaughter them all before they can escape.”\n\"......\"\nFrom the moment they spotted the bandit group, they weren't thinking about how to deal with them, but rather how to ensure not a single one escaped alive.\n'Crazy.'\nWas it the Demonic Arts and the cult brainwashing that made them so casual about murder?\n‘No, even the martial artists in the Central Plains were pretty much the same.’\nWhen I was working as a waiter, Uncle Taehyun often warned me to be careful of martial artists, as they were psychos who would pull a sword if you looked at them wrong.\nNeigh!\nWhile I was thinking all this, the bandits were getting closer and closer.\nThere were about twenty guys on maybe a dozen horses.\nHorses must be pricey in this era, as only two of them had their own ride, and the rest were riding horses in pairs.\nNeigh!\nThe bandits finally stopped, forming a circle around us at a distance of about six meters from us.\nA tough-looking middle-aged guy who seemed to be the boss just glared at us with his arms crossed. The guy next to him, however, pulled out a big sword and yelled, “Drop all your valuables and you can go! Do that, and we’ll let you live!”\nAfter he yelled, everything went quiet for a second.\nJust as the two escort warriors were about to make their move to slaughter them.\n\"Wait!\"\nI quickly shouted and poked my head out of the carriage.\nThe two warriors who had gripped their weapons to strike looked at me with bewildered expressions.\nThe bandits' attention also shifted to me.\nI knew perfectly well that if I’d just stayed quiet in the carriage, my bodyguards would have mopped the floor with these guys in no time.\nIn the first place, they were escorts assigned by my Master; there was no way the likes of mere bandits would defeat them.\nStill, I stepped in for a few reasons.\nThe most naive and foolish reason was that I didn't want to see twenty humans get massacred.\nAnd the calculated reason was that it would be a waste to kill the horses. Horses were expensive even in modern times, but in this era, horses were an even more important resource as they were used for far more diverse purposes.\nOf course, risking your neck to save a few taels is stupid. But I had another reason.\n‘ They have no killing intent. ’\nThat’s weird for a bunch of guys trying to rob someone at sword-point.\nMaybe because I’ve been on the receiving end of the real deal from my Master and Eldest Brother, I was more sensitive to killing intent than my level would suggest.\nAnd I couldn't sense any killing intent from these guys. Either they had no intention of killing us, or they were such total rookies they couldn’t even look menacing if they tried.\n‘Which means they’re not even a morning workout for the escort warriors.’\nThinking that, I focused on the guy in the middle who looked like the boss.\n'As expected.'\nThat leader was wearing an expression I was quite familiar with.\nIt was an expression that any person would make often—that specific look one gets when being forced to do something one does not want to do.\nOnce I saw that, I gave orders to the escort warriors who were ready to swing their weapons.\n\"Can you subdue them without killing if possible?\"\n“Is there a need for that?”\n\"I have something I want to check. Besides, it’s a waste of good horses, isn’t it?”\nDid my words provoke the bandits?\n\"These bastards must have a death wish!\"\nSeveral of them dismounted and charged at us with weapons in hand.\n\"Sigh.\"\n\"I'll try my best, but if they resist too much, it can't be helped.\"\nThe two escort warriors sighed and flew towards the bandits using their lightness skills.\nClang!!\n\"!?\"\nI guess they really weren't expecting my bodyguards’ skills to be that high.\nThe bandits' eyes widened in shock as their weapons were sliced in half in a single clash.\nThud!\nThen the escort warriors struck the stunned bandits' bodies.\nWatching the bandits fly away like a scene from a cartoon, I wondered if this was really their way of trying to spare lives.\n‘So this is really what it means to just spare their lives.’\nI watched the flying bandits with a dumbfounded expression.\n\"How dare you!!\"\n\"We won't let this slide!!\"\nMore bandits charged at the two escort warriors.\nBang!!\nAnd they were sent flying even faster than they had charged in.\nThis absurd scene continued for a while, and then—\n\"Stand back!!\"\nThe boss, who’d been hanging back with his arms crossed, finally made his move. He roared, yanked out a massive glaive, and launched himself off his horse straight at Jang Hwi.\nClang!!\n\"Hooh.\"\nJang Hwi let out a little hum of interest as their weapons met. It was only one hit, but this guy hadn't gone flying like the rest.\nClang!\nClang!\nThe bandit leader and Jang Hwi continued to exchange blows with their glaive and spear.\nKwan Mu-yeol stood nearby like a guardian, blocking other bandits from interfering.\nIt was then that Jang Hwi, who had been trading blows with the leader, spoke as if he had realized something.\n“I had a hunch, but you guys… You’re from the military, aren’t you?”\n\"!!!\"\nThe bandits' expressions showed surprise at Jang Hwi’s words, and the bandit leader shouted with a twisted face.\n\"And you lot are filthy Demonic Cult scums!\"\nThe bandits' expressions hardened, as if they finally understood why the warriors' skills were so exceptional.\nBut the one whose expression hardened the most was someone else.\n\"What did you just say?\"\nIt was the bandit leader who had dared to blaspheme in front of a devout cult fanatic.\n\"Enough playing around. Die.\"\nAs the enraged Jang Hwi began to swing his spear in earnest, the bandit leader was instantly pushed into a defensive position.\nClang!\nThough he desperately blocked the spear a few times, the bandit leader's crescent moon glaive finally flew upward and...\nSwish!\nIn that moment, Jang Hwi’s spear thrust toward the bandit leader's heart.\n\"Don't kill him!\"\nI shouted at Jang Hwi. He clicked his tongue before changing the spear’s trajectory.\nThwack!\nJang Hwi struck the bandit leader in the torso with the shaft of his spear, then closed in and sealed his pressure points.\nAnd right after the boss was subdued, the bandits showed an unexpected reaction.\n\"Big Brother!!\"\nWithout hesitation, the remaining bandits all charged at Jang Hwi.\nFor bandits to show such loyalty. It was an incredibly bizarre sight and...\nBang!\n\"Ugh...\"\nAs payment for their loyalty, the bandits were once again sent flying in all directions.\nKneeling in a battered line, the bandits glared as I approached their leader.\n\"So, why is a military man like yourself engaging in banditry here?\"\n\"......\"\nAs if possessed by Guan Yu's unwavering loyalty, he remained silent with a determined look.\nFortunately, Jang Hwi answered my question in his stead.\n\"They're probably deserters, Young Master. I've heard that in the past, there were many bandits from Xinjiang, but after our Divine Cult settled in Xinjiang, their numbers drastically decreased. Recently, most bandits are either people who fled from the Central Plains after committing serious crimes, or deserters like these men.\"\nAs if struck a nerve, the bandit leader's face contorted, and he shouted.\n\"How dare you insult me, you filthy Demonic Cult scums!\"\nOnce again, the bandit leader insulted the cult, and killing intent flickered in Jang Hwi and Kwan Mu-yeol's eyes.\n\"We should cut out that tongue of yours to teach you manners.\"\nAs the two warriors began to draw their weapons, I intervened.\n\"Stop.\"\nI knew just saying ‘don’t kill him’ wouldn’t work with these guys.\n“Killing him now would be letting him off too easy. Shouldn’t he pay a proper price for his crimes?”\nMy words seemed to work as the two warriors who were about to draw their weapons stopped and looked at me.\nThen I turned to the bandit group and asked.\n\"I'll ask again. Why are military deserters engaging in banditry here? If you don't answer properly, I'll cut off your heads one by one.\"\nSince these men showed unusual loyalty for a bandit leader, I figured threatening the group would be effective.\nAnd my prediction was correct.\nGritting his teeth, the bandit leader began to tell his story in the hope of saving his subordinates.\nIt was a common tale.\nThe bandit leader was a man of common birth who had served in the military for over twenty years and had worked his way to the rank of a captain of a hundred men.\nThen, a year ago, a young brat at least ten years his junior was appointed as his superior.\nObviously, that person was from a prestigious family, and the two constantly clashed.\nEventually, the kid got tired of the old veteran breathing down his neck and decided to frame him.\nHe framed him for embezzling military supplies.\nThe bandit leader was about to be executed when his loyal subordinates, who had served with him for over a decade, rescued him at night and deserted with him, along with their horses.\nAfter hearing his rather cliché story, I asked again.\n“So you go through all that to escape, and then you just become bandits? Let’s be real here, if you sold these horses, you’d have more than enough money to start over somewhere.”\nAt my words, the bandit leader roared in frustration.\n\"It's because of you bastards!! You filthy Demonic Cult scums!!\"\n“What kind of bullshit is that? How is it our fault?”\n\"We escaped here because we knew we'd be hunted down as deserters if we returned to the Central Plains, but no one would take us in! Every village we went to, they looked at us like monsters and chased us away! If it weren't for you brainwashing them, would this have happened?!\"\nAnswering his rage-filled shout was Jang Hwi, wearing a cold smile.\n“You just say whatever you want with that mouth of yours, don’t you? We only helped the people of Xinjiang. None of this would be happening if your army hadn’t been oppressing them for years.”\nJang Hwi’s following explanation was simple.\nThe Imperial Court had often dispatched troops to annex the Xinjiang region into the Central Plains, and each time, the people of Xinjiang had resisted, being massacred in the process. In that process, the Demonic Cult fought alongside the Xinjiang residents.\nApparently, it happened all the time until Master became the Heavenly Demon, which put a stop to it a few decades back.\nSomehow, listening to this reminded me of the Xinjiang Uyghur oppression I often heard about in modern times.\n'Nothing's changed, past or present.'\nHaving grasped the situation, I asked my final question.\n“So, how many innocent people have you killed during your little bandit career?”\nThe bandit leader looked deeply insulted by my question.\n\"I only did it to keep my brothers who risked their lives for me from starving. We only subdued those who resisted; we didn't kill them! So stop insulting me and just kill me already! Let my brothers go and take my head!”\n\"Big Brother!!\"\n\"No, Boss! Let me die instead! You must survive, Boss!!\"\nAll of a sudden, these guys started acting out a scene from a bad soap opera.\n'What a show they're putting on.'\nI scoffed in disbelief and opened my mouth.\n\"Kill you? Why would I kill you?\"\nThese men are from the military. Moreover, they practice genuine martial arts rather than Demonic Arts, meaning they should be somewhat literate.\n“If you commit a crime, you have to pay the price. And since you’re broke, you'll have to pay with your bodies.\"\nIn other words, the perfect workforce for that little project I came up with back in Kuqa County had just fallen right into my lap.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 33 : Recruitment (2)",
    "content": "Chapter 33: Recruitment (2)\nAfter finalizing negotiations with the former bandits—now enslaved—we headed to Hejing County.\nSince marching into Hejing County with nearly twenty slaves would draw too much attention, we decided to take the bandit leader as a hostage. The rest were instructed to camp some distance away from Hejing County.\nDue to the delay caused by dealing with the bandits, it was already completely dark by the time we reached Hejing County. As we did in Kuqa County, we stayed at an inn for the night and began our inspection of Hejing County the next morning.\nAfter walking around the village for quite some time with the former bandit leader, who was being dragged along with a face full of resentment, I stroked my beardless chin and concluded, \"It's not much different from Kuqa County.\"\nThe scene was similar.\nThe martial artists of the branch headquarters were helping villagers with their work, and someone who appeared to be the Branch Leader was struggling to teach children while being bombarded with their endless chatter.\nThe one fortunate difference was that this Branch Leader wasn't flying into a rage.\nJust as I concluded there wasn't much else worth examining, a loud commotion caught my attention.\n\"Warriors! Please help me!\"\nA middle-aged man was clinging to the leg of a young man in Demonic Cult attire, crying for help. The young warrior, who appeared to be from the Demonic Cult's branch, wore a troubled expression. Judging by the items in his hands, he seemed to be in the middle of helping with other tasks.\n‘Hmm. Are they short on manpower?’\nI guess it would be tough for a handful of warriors to help out with every single chore in the village. I knew they were supposed to be helping families on a rotating basis. Still, the labor of martial arts-trained warriors would be far more efficient than that of children, so even if they took turns, the efficiency would be higher.\n'Tsk. He should just wait for his turn patiently. Or could it be that this branch is already showing signs of corruption, only helping those they're close to?'\nThat thought crossed my mind, but the ensuing conversation proved me wrong.\n“Please, just wait a little longer. We have already sent a message to the main headquarters, and they will soon dispatch a combat unit.”\n“What if those bastards escape in the meantime!”\n“Have faith in the Divine Cult's forces. No matter how far those bastards run, they will be hunted down and punished.”\n“We’re grateful for your help with chores and teaching our children, but catching criminals is your duty too! This is why we pay tithes to the Cult!”\nIt seemed someone had been robbed or had their property stolen.\nFeeling the need to understand the situation better, I approached them and asked, \"Is there a problem?\"\nIn response to my question, the man clutching the warrior's pants explained his grievance.\nHe was a nomad who traveled across Xinjiang with his companions, herding goats and donkeys, and selling milk and animal byproducts in villages along the way. While heading to Hejing County, they encountered bandits.\nThough they fortunately escaped with their lives, they lost all their livestock and were on the verge of becoming beggars.\nAfter hearing the story, I immediately struck the back of the former bandit leader's head who was standing beside me.\nThwack!\n\"Ugh...\"\nWhile the bandit leader groaned in pain, both the pitiful nomad and the branch warrior looked at me with expressions questioning my actions.\nMeanwhile, I lifted the chin of the bandit leader who was clutching his head and asked, \"Don't you recognize this face from somewhere?\"\nThe nomad’s eyes widened as he scrutinized the bandit leader’s face.\n\"Th-this is him!! He's definitely the leader of that bandit group!!\"\n\"!!!\"\nAt his shout, everyone around, including the branch warriors who had been watching, looked back and forth between me and the bandit leader in surprise.\nI turned to look at Jin Hayeon, who was holding my identity token.\nSince we had roughly finished inspecting Hejing County and people's attention was already on us, I saw no need to hide our identities any longer.\nUnderstanding my intention, Jin Hayeon pulled out the identity token from her sleeve and held it forward.\n\"This is the Eighth Disciple of the Supreme One, Young Master Il-mok.\"\n“We greet the disciple of the Heavenly Demon!!”\nAs soon as her introduction ended, the branch warrior performed a full kowtow, and the onlookers gradually began kneeling one by one.\n\"Rise.\"\nStill not used to this kind of power play, I told them to get up and said, \"As the Eighth Disciple of the Supreme One, I came here after hearing news of those who disturb our Cult’s territory.\"\n\"Th-then, have you eliminated all the bandits who were terrorizing us?!\"\n\"Indeed.\"\nI answered with complete confidence.\nThough our original purpose was inspection, there was no need to explain that in detail.\nMoreover...\n'As expected, some are starting to lose faith.'\nAs I’d told Master, people tend to take kindness for granted. The nomad clinging to the warrior's leg was proof of that.\nSo, I needed to take this opportunity to reinforce their wavering faith.\n‘Though I have no idea why I am the one who must play this role…’\nJust then, the nomad, whose faith was lacking, cautiously asked.\n\"B-but why only the leader?\"\n\"I killed the rest. Dragging a few dozen bodies back here would have been a pain, so I just brought him along as proof.” Get full chapters from novel(ꜰ)ire.net\n\"!!!\"\nThis time, Jin Hayeon, the two escorts, and even the bandit boss looked at me with shocked expressions.\nI glared at all four of them, trying to convey with my eyes:\n— Just read the room and play along!\n\"Ahem. That's correct.\"\nSeemingly understanding my intention, the two escort warriors coughed, and Jin Hayeon returned to her usual stoic expression.\nJust then, an observant onlooker asked a sharp question.\n\"But weren't you walking around the village with that bandit leader since morning? Why did you hide that fact?\"\nWell, it was for the inspection. Additionally, I had other plans for this bandit leader rather than killing him.\nBut explaining all that would only weaken the impact of my words.\n\"It was to test your faith!\"\nI decided to choose an answer befitting a disciple of a cult leader's disciple.\n\"I observed the village to see how much faith you have in our Cult, but honestly, I am quite disappointed!\"\nAt my rebuke, the villagers—including the nomadic herder with the weakest devotion—dropped to their knees again, babbling pleas.\n\"Oh, Savior!!\"\n\"Please forgive us!!\"\n\"We have committed a mortal sin, Young Master!!\"\nA wave of guilt washed over me as I looked at them fervently repenting, but there was no turning back now. It was best to wrap things up quickly.\nThud\n“This is compensation for what you lost to those bandits. If it’s not enough, I’ll have the headquarters send you more.”\nFirst, I threw my emergency money pouch to the nomad who had lost everything, then declared.\n“The Divine Cult strives to help and protect you. If you take our kindness for granted, we won’t be able to help you. I’ll overlook this incident, but I expect you to have more faith in our Divine Cult and follow us.”\n\"Ahhh!!\"\n“We will follow you, Young Master!”\n\"Long live! Long live! Long live the Heavenly Demon!!\"\n\"Please save us!!\"\nPerhaps believing they had been forgiven for their sins, the villagers bowed to me as if I were Master himself.\n“Then I shall take this scoundrel to the cult and conclude this matter. All of you, return to your work.”\nHaving said that, I turned around without delay and headed towards the inn where the carriage was parked.\nIt wasn't just because playing the role of a cult leader was burdensome.\n'Damn. I should have sent them farther away if I'd known this would happen.'\nWe had wasted too much time, and there was a risk that others might discover the bandits waiting outside the village.\nEspecially since they had already requested support from the headquarters.\nWhile we were wasting time here, the bandits might be annihilated by the cult's forces.\nNot only would that expose my lie, but it would also be troublesome if the men I had other plans for died so meaninglessly.\n'Sigh. To think we have to leave without even receiving hospitality.'\nThe hospitality we received in Kuqa County flashed before my eyes. I glanced over my shoulder and saw Jin Hayeon, my bodyguards, and the bandit leader all staring at me with different looks on their faces.\nSome of them looked impressed. Some of them looked like they’d just seen a magic trick. And then there was the bandit leader, who still looked like he’d been sucking on a lemon. So I smacked him again.\nThwack!\nIt was all his fault that I was missing out on a free meal.\nThe carriage that left Hejing County headed toward the location where we had arranged to meet the bandits.\nMaybe because their leader was held hostage, they were waiting there obediently. We set off for the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult headquarters with them in tow.\nAs a precaution, all the bandits had their pressure points sealed as they rode horses following us.\nAnd the bandit leader, who was essentially a hostage, was kept in the carriage with us to prevent any rescue attempts by his men.\nI asked Hang Geon, who still wore a sour expression.\n\"What's with that sour face?\"\n\"How could I not be displeased when I'm being dragged around like this?\"\nI chuckled and replied, \"Didn't you hear back in the village? They called in the cult's forces to kill you. If it weren't for me, you'd all be headless in a few days.\"\n\"I'd rather die than be treated like this!!\"\nI was starting to get annoyed.\n\"I've been thinking this since yesterday, but you're truly an idiot. It's a waste that those men risked their lives to save someone like you.\"\n\"Just kill me if you're going to insult me like this!\"\n\"Is your life just about you? You’ve got men who follow you! You need to be responsible for them! It was the same yesterday when you were robbing people. It was the same yesterday when you were playing bandit. The one who’s supposed to be the leader practically reeked of unwillingness. While your men did all the work, you just watched. You idiot. I don't even need the details to see why you got framed.”\n“Wh-what was that?!”\n\"Shut up and listen! You're a moron with nothing left but your pride. That newbie guy was from a well-off family, right? That guy would have risen so high that he wouldn't even see the likes of you after a few years anyway. Was it that hard to endure those few years? Did it have to come to your men risking their lives to desert en masse just because of your ego?\"\n\"!!!\"\nHang Geon's eyes shook violently.\nIf his answer here had been to blame his men at this point, then I would’ve scrapped all my plans and either killed him or kicked him out of the carriage right then and there.\nWorking with a worthless leader who won’t take responsibility is the fastest way to make sure everything goes to hell.\n“You know what I would have done? I would have seen it as a chance. I’d have swallowed my pride, flattered him a bit, and grabbed onto his coattails. Sure, that punk was incompetent. But you could have buttered him up, become his friend, and then gently guided him in the right direction. Don't you think you should have done at least that much for the sake of these men who trust and follow you?\"\n\"...\"\nMaybe because I kept pushing him, Hang Geon, who had been stubbornly resisting, hung his head low, seemingly defeated.\nSeeing him lost in thought, my anger subsided a little\nA moment later...\nAs if he'd organized his thoughts, Hang Geon asked in a calmer voice.\n“So, are you planning to spare us?”\n\"I'll have to discuss it with Master, but if you do as you're told, I have no intention of harming you.\"\n\"I must survive, even as a slave. For the sake of my brothers.\"\nIn response to Hang Geon's bitter final words, I smiled gently and replied.\n“Don’t worry. If you do a good job, you won’t be living like slaves. I might be young, but I’m a disciple of the Heavenly Demon. Maybe it’s time you tried latching onto the right person for a change, eh?”\n\"!!!\"\nHang Geon looked completely stunned. Then, even with his hands tied, he threw himself forward and banged his head on the floor in a makeshift kowtow.\n\"I shall serve you as my lord!\"",

    "content": "Chapter 34: Recruitment (3)\nBy the time we reached the main headquarters of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult after a two-day journey, the sun had already set.\nAnd no sooner had I arrived at the headquarters than my Master summoned me. The official story was that he was treating me to dinner for all my hard work.\nBut—\n“Hahaha. So, tell me about your trip.”\nAs expected, Master brought up work during our dinner.\nMy stomach was rumbling, but I put down my chopsticks and got ready to give my report.\n“I found a few areas for improvement, Master.”\n\"Oh? More than what I expected.\"\nI explained what I had seen in Kuqa County. I told him about how the Branch Leader had gone berserk from the side effect of his Demonic Art while teaching children.\n\"It seems we need to punish the Branch Leader of Kuqa County.\"\n\"There's no need for that. The Branch Leader of Hejing County didn't go berserk, but it was obvious they were struggling just as much.\"\n\"Hmm. Now that you mention it, others who went on audits to different counties reported similar stories. They said the Branch Leaders were having trouble teaching large groups of children.\"\n“Yes. If it were just one or two cases, it would be an individual problem, but when similar problems occur in multiple locations, it means there's a systemic issue.”\n\"Then, what solution did you come up with?\"\n\"First, we need criteria for selecting the teachers. There's no need for the Branch Leaders to personally teach children how to read. It's not a task that requires martial arts proficiency or experience, is it?\"\n\"That's true.\"\n\"So, we should select teachers based on the side effects of the Demonic Arts they've learned. We should exclude those who've learned arts that cause anger, depression, or obsessive symptoms, and instead choose those with mania or emotionally numbed tendencies.\"\nWhen Master nodded at my explanation, I continued.\n\"Of course, that alone won't be enough to completely control the children. And that issue could cause mental strain on the teacher, leading to problems.\"\nSince everyone who cultivated Demonic Arts suffered from mental illnesses, there was no telling what terrible things might happen if they were pushed too far.\nTherefore, they needed to be managed in a systematic way that wouldn't overwhelm them.\n\"So, we need to give some flexibility in children's education. Since children have limited attention spans, we should have three quarters (45 minutes) of class followed by one quarter (15 minutes) of break, and only conduct two sessions like this.\"\n(The measurement used on this is called kè (刻). One ke is usually defined as roughly 14 minutes. But I rounded them up and translated them into quarters for an easier reading experience.)\nThis concept was borrowed from modern education systems. Updates are released by novelꜰire.net\nEven in modern times, elementary school students have 40-minute classes with 10-minute breaks. High school students have 50-minute classes with 10-minute breaks.\nI just adjusted it to quarters since the concept of minutes doesn't exist here.\n“Additionally, each lesson should cover only one line of the Thousand Character Classic, which is four characters, repeated twice. So, only eight characters per day.”\n“Isn’t that too little?”\n\"Even with just eight characters per day, they can complete the Thousand Character Classic in 125 days. If we speed up a bit at the end, they could go through it three times in a year.\"\nWe also discussed what to do if a child misbehaved.\nI told Master how to deal with misbehaving children as I told the Branch Leader of Kuqa County. You don’t discipline them yourself. You just send them home and let their parents deal with it.\n\"Hmm. So you're trying to reduce the mental pressure on those teaching the children.\"\n“Exactly.”\nMaster nodded in understanding and asked, \"So, after about two hours of education, the children are sent home?\"\nI shook my head.\nWhat I had explained to Master so far were the solutions I had first thought of when I saw the Branch Leader going berserk in Kuqa County.\nAnd thanks to the damn side effect of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, I had a few more ideas.\n\"After the two hours of education, it would be good to conduct basic martial arts training and external strength training.\"\n\"!?\"\nFor the first time, surprise appeared on Master's face.\n“Are you suggesting we teach commoner children Demonic Arts?”\n\"Not Demonic Arts, Master, but basic martial arts and external training. Children who learn exercise and basic breathing techniques from a young age will greatly benefit when they do physical labor later in life. Also, this increases our chances of discovering talented individuals.\"\n“Oh? So you’re saying we teach them basic martial arts and select those with talent to learn Demonic Arts.”\n“Exactly. We plan to teach them the Thousand Character Classic for a year, followed by a year of the cult’s doctrines, giving us two years to observe them. During these two years, the Branch Leaders in each region can identify and report exceptionally talented children to the cult.”\nTo use a modern analogy, the current talent development system of the Demonic Cult was similar to elite sports training.\nAnd I was trying to make it more accessible, like a community sports program.\nThe more children practice martial arts, the higher the chance of discovering talented ones.\n“Hmm. Then, in addition to a simplified doctrinal book for children, we’ll also need to prepare basic martial arts and external training methods for them to learn.”\n“There’s no need to worry about that. I’ve brought about twenty deserters from the military who have trained in martial arts.”\nThis was why I deliberately brought along those bandits after learning they were army deserters.\nDemonic Arts were overpowered techniques. The threshold requirements for Demonic Arts were lower than the usual martial arts and provided rapid growth in martial prowess.\nHowever, the terrifying side effects they brought with them made them unsuitable for children to learn.\nIn contrast, military martial arts likely had systematic basic-level techniques organized for teaching conscripts.\nMoreover...\n\"If there are regions where none of the cult’s Branch Leaders are suitable to be instructors, we can dispatch these men.\"\nThey were all-around talents when it came to teaching children, especially compared to the mentally unstable demonic cultivators.\nAnd finally...\n“Children have limited attention spans. If we focus solely on education and training, problems may arise. So, after about half an hour of training, it would be good to have some playtime as a reward for good behavior.”\nWith that, I unfolded the booklet I had prepared that was filled with illustrations and explanations.\nA ball made from an animal bladder, coated with glue, and reinforced with twine or dried grass.\nAnd games of kicking this ball around or throwing it to hit each other, in other words, soccer and dodgeball.\nThis was the final concept for the “school” that had crystalized in my head, born from a weird mix of my modern memories and my Demonic Art’s side effect.\nIt was a place that taught kids martial arts and sports, provided basic character education, and offered them games for playtime.\nIt’s the one ray of hope for working parents trying to raise kids with boundless energy who won't sleep unless they run around all day.\nIt's an institution that has started to spread all over the world, even to America.\nThat is—\nTaekwondo academy.\nAfterward, Il-mok and the Heavenly Demon continued their conversation over dinner.\nIt was time to discuss the details regarding the system Il-mok had proposed.\nFor example, what rewards should be given to Branch Leaders who successfully identify talented children, and what penalties should be imposed on those who recklessly recommend children just for the reward?\nAfter this excruciating meal where he barely knew if he was eating or not due to the endless work talk, the Heavenly Demon dismissed Il-mok and returned to his office.\nWhile Heavenly Demon was lost in thought at his office after sending Il-mok away, a visitor came to see him.\n“The Divine Guardian requests an audience with the Heavenly Demon.”\nThe Sacred Order was the group in charge of guarding the Demonic Cult’s major facilities and high-ranking figures. And its leader was one of the Cult's most skilled martial artists.\nThe Heavenly Demon stroked his beard and looked up at the newcomer. \"What brings you here at this late hour?\"\n\"I came urgently after hearing stories from Kwan Mu-yeol and Jang Hwi, who were assigned to guard Young Master Il-mok this time.\"\n\"Hmm. I'm curious what stories you heard.\"\nThe Divine Guardian explained that Il-mok was attacked by the Kuqa County Branch Leader and encountered bandits.\n\"Additionally, Young Master Il-mok was previously attacked by the First Disciple when he went berserk. Therefore, for Young Master Il-mok's safety, I really don't think leaving his protection to a single servant girl is enough, O Supreme One.”\nThe Heavenly Demon nodded in agreement.\n'Indeed. Since Il-mok is bringing about changes, we need to prepare for dangers.'\nHe had thought Il-mok would be safe since he'd only begun cultivating Demonic Art four months ago, but somehow, incidents kept happening around him.\nThe incident with Wi Jin-hak, the issue with the Hyeokryeon Family. They all stemmed from the changes Il-mok was bringing about.\nAnd changes naturally lead to conflicts.\n\"Then, who do you plan to assign?\"\n“I was thinking we should assign the two men from this last trip to be his permanent bodyguards. They’ve already spent four days with him, so the Young Master should be comfortable with them by now.”\nHeavenly Demon nodded at the Divine Guardian's suggestion.\n\"Do so.\"\nAfter meeting with Heavenly Demon, the Divine Guardian returned not to his quarters but to the Sacred Order, as if he had more work to do.\nWhile he was there, reading and checking several letters...\n\"Enter.\"\nDespite the lack of any presence, the Divine Guardian spoke into the empty air. The door cautiously opened, and a figure entered the room.\nThe room was dark, and the only source of light was a candle on the desk that did little to push back the shadows.\nThe Divine Guardian looked at the man whose face was completely hidden in the darkness.\n“Starting tomorrow, you’re being assigned as the Eighth Young Master’s personal bodyguard.”\n“I will obey your command.”\nConfirming the man's bow from within the shadows, the Divine Guardian continued.\n“Your real job is to watch his every move and report everything back to me. You will determine whether he’s just a harmless kid we can ignore or if he’s going to be a problem we need to eliminate down the line. And if we do have to get rid of him, you need to come up with a way to do it that can't be traced back to us.”\nHe could have had his man kill Il-mok during the trip but that would have directly implicated the man and risked exposing himself as well.\nAnd there was another reason he'd held back…\n‘Knowing the Heavenly Demon, it is highly likely that he has made separate preparations in addition to the two I assigned.’\nThe chance that there was a hidden protector he didn't know about was why he decided just to watch and wait.\nThey needed to find a way to handle it without exposing themselves.\nIt wasn't impossible. Not when they had a man on the inside watching his every move.\nAnd they had done it twice already.\nThere was the Fourth Young Master, whose exceptional talent they had exploited by leaking information to the Orthodox Faction of the Central Plains, leading to his death, and the Fifth Young Master, whom they disposed of by faking Qi Deviation because he had noticed their trail.\nThe cover-up wasn't difficult since the Second and Seventh Young Masters had died due to their own recklessness without them having to deal with it.\nRecalling those memories, the Divine Guardian asked the man in the darkness.\n“Speaking of which, you’ve spent the last four days with him, so you should have some understanding of him. What are your impressions of the Eighth Young Master?”\nThe man in the darkness recalled what he had seen in Hejing County and answered.\n“To put it nicely, he’s skilled at improvisation and manipulation.”\nThe way he had captured all the bandits and then said he killed them all without changing expression.\nAnd the way he had seamlessly manipulated the villagers into repenting, even though he was supposed to be there for an audit, came to the man's mind as he frowned.\nThe memory of Il-mok extorting hospitality from the Branch Leader in Kuqa County, and his sly behavior towards them, also surfaced.\n“And to put it badly, he’s like a con man.”\nHis so-called improvisation and manipulation were nothing more than an endless stream of lies. Every time he opened his mouth, a lie would come out.",

    "content": "Chapter 35: Intoxication (1)\nAfter the man in the shadows departed, the Divine Guardian was lost in thought.\n‘Skilled at manipulation, huh…’\nMost would see that as a bad thing, but the ability to stir up a crowd was crucial. Especially for leading a religious group like the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, it was an invaluable ability.\nThe escort's opinion of the Eighth Young Master is that of a con man.\nHowever, the Divine Guardian did not think so.\n'If he were truly just a con man, the Heavenly Demon would never fall for it.’\nThe current Heavenly Demon wasn't some fool who'd get duped by a cheap con man.\nIf he were that kind of person, he wouldn't have risen to become the Heavenly Demon in the first place, and there would be no reason for them to move so cautiously.\nThe current Heavenly Demon's abilities were beyond doubt, and the faith in him within the cult was absolute.\nThat was why they were lying low, waiting for the time after the current Heavenly Demon's ascension.\nTherefore, there could be only one conclusion.\n‘His deceitful behavior must be an act to fool outsiders.’\nWhen this thought struck the Divine Guardian, goosebumps rose on his forearms.\nThe fact that he possessed such calculations at the mere age of fifteen was astonishing.\n‘He must be eliminated.’\nFor Il-mok, this couldn't have been a more frustrating misunderstanding.\nThe day after I returned to headquarters, my life went back to normal.\nOr rather, I hoped it would.\n“Why are you here again?”\nWhen I asked Kwan Mu-yeol and Jang Hwi, who came to Windrock Palace early in the morning, the two men took turns answering.\n\"By order of the Supreme One and the Divine Guardian.\"\n\"From now on, we've been assigned as your personal guards.\"\nTheir answer reminded me of the time I was chased by my berserk Eldest Brother.\nIndeed, guards seemed necessary to survive in this damned cult\nBut I hadn’t forgotten how these two had worked me like a dog before.\n“You’re not planning to force me into another ‘training session’ like last time, are you? I already have enough training with Miss Jin and Master.”\n“Back then, it was because of the Supreme One's decree that we had no choice but to do so.”\nJang Hwi stressed 'had no choice' in his reply, while Kwan Mu-yeol wore an expression suggesting the question wasn't even worth answering.\n\"We're simply here to protect you. We won't interfere with your affairs otherwise. Unless the Supreme One orders it, that is.\"\n\"Hmm. I'll trust you for now.\"\nIgnoring the two escorts now stationed at the corner of Windrock Palace, I began my morning lessons with Jin Hayeon.\nBy the time I’d finished lunch and my martial arts training, I heard Kwan Mu-yeol’s voice at the entrance, followed by a lively, familiar one I hadn’t heard in ages.\n\"Young Master, you have a visitor.\"\n\"Big Brother!!\"\nI told him to open the door, and the second he did, a Seon-ah-shaped missile landed in my arms.\nWas this how it felt to come home after a business trip and be greeted by your daughter running to hug you?\n\"Hahaha. Did you miss me that much?\"\nA genuine smile spread across my face.\nBeing surrounded by people who either wanted to monitor me or train me to death, and constantly dealing with Demonic Arts and cult doctrines, this moment felt like sweet rain after a long drought.\nSpending time with such an adorable little one was my brief moment of happiness in this damned cult.\n\"So, did you do your homework while I was gone?\"\nHer bright, round eyes gleamed as she excitedly recounted her past five days.\n“Yes! I can now pierce rocks with the Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art! Auntie said that with this level, I don’t even need to avoid the ribs, I can stab straight through to the heart!”\n\"I-Is that so?\"\nI wasn’t sure why her achievements sounded so brutal, but I let her chatter on, savoring the peace.\n\"Young Master, the First Young Master has arrived.\"\n\"Hahaha. Youngest! You there?\"\nThis time, my Eldest Brother came to visit.\nI patted Seon-ah's head, whose lips were about to pout, before standing to greet him.\nI hated having my break cut short, but it couldn't be helped.\n\"Greetings, Eldest Brother. What brings you here today?\"\nAs I spoke, I shot a quick look at Hang Geon standing next to him. What was he doing here?\n“Hahaha! Master put me in charge of that school program you proposed. Now that I've achieved Transcendence, he says I need to learn about governing the cult, not just leading the combat unit.”\n\"Congratulations, Eldest Brother. It seems Master expects you to become the next Heavenly Demon. Hahaha.\"\n\"Uahaha! Isn't this all thanks to my little brother!\"\nMy flattery seemed to work as Eldest Brother burst into hearty laughter.\n\"Anyway, that's why I’m here. Master sent me to collaborate with this fellow here and you. Our task is to organize basic martial arts training for children and compile teaching materials for each branch.\"\n\"It shall be done, my lord.\"\n\"I hear Hang Geon has pledged his loyalty to you. Since I'll be your lord, he'll naturally serve me as well. Hahaha!\"\nMy head spun as I watched Hang Geon, who was now respectfully calling me 'Lord,' while my Eldest Brother rambled on and on.\nBut the visitors didn't end with those two.\n\"Young Master Il-mok, the Third Young Master has arrived.\"\nKwan Mu-yeol's voice rang out like a human doorbell in his usual monotonous tone, and soon after, Third Brother entered the hall.\nCaught off guard by Eldest Brother’s presence, Third Brother quickly gave him a martial salute.\n\"Greetings, Eldest Brother.”\n“Hahaha. It seems Third Brother also has something to discuss with our youngest!”\n\"Indeed.\"\nAfter a brief greeting, Third Brother came straight to me.\n\"Youngest.\"\n\"Yes, brother?\"\n\"Thank you.\"\n\"Pardon?\"\nWhat the hell was he talking about?\n\"This worthless brother of yours has made progress in his martial arts recently. It's all thanks to you for believing in me.”\n“Ha… Hahaha… That’s… that’s all thanks to your own effort and talent, Third Brother. I didn’t do anything.”\n“No. Thanks to you, I’ve been having fewer negative thoughts lately. I owe it all to you, Il-mok.”\n“Ahem. Congratulations on your achievement, Third Brother.”\n\"Uahahahaha! Congratulations, brother! If I don't work harder, Third Brother might surpass me!\"\nPerhaps because Eldest Brother suddenly joined the conversation, shouts of \"Congratulations!\" erupted from all corners of Windrock Palace.\nJin Hayeon with her stoic face and Jang Hwi with his faint smile, chimed in as well.\n\"Congratulations!!\"\nHang Geon was shouting at the top of his lungs, flattering my Third Brother as if he were a devout follower of the Cult.\n'What's wrong with this guy?'\nI get that he had a change of heart, but for a guy who was all about pride to turn into a total bootlicker overnight was really something.\n\"Congratulations.\"\nSeon-ah peeked out from behind me and mumbled her congratulations.\nShe clearly said that out of courtesy, as her polite tone couldn't mask her sulking expression. She was clearly upset that our playtime had been interrupted.\nMeanwhile, my Third Brother blushed and squirmed awkwardly.\n\"Ahem. Ahem.\"\nWhile I was smiling wryly at the absurd sight, the human doorbell rang again.\n\"Young Master Il-mok, the Sixth Young Master has arrived.\"\n\"!?\"\nNow this was a surprise guest.\nMy Sixth Brother, afflicted by visual and auditory hallucinations from cultivating the Mad Soul Sword Art, shared no bond with me.\nWe hadn't even met since the last banquet.\nBut turning him away wasn’t an option.\n“Greetings, Sixth Brother.”\nAs Jong-ri Chu entered, I greeted him with a bow, and he immediately greeted my other senior brothers.\n“Greetings, Eldest Brother. Greetings, Third Brother.”\n“Hahaha! Welcome! What brings you here, Sixth?”\nActing as if this were his house, Eldest Brother asked the question on my behalf.\n\"I heard Eldest brother and Third brother often visit our youngest here, so curiosity got the better of me and I came to see for myself today.\"\n“Hahaha. Is that so? Oh, I forgot to mention, we're celebrating Third Brother's recent martial arts progress.”\n\"Congratulations, brother!\"\nJust as my Sixth Brother was quickly saluting the Third, the human doorbell went off. Again\n\"Young Master, Ouyang Mun of the White Tortoise Corps requests an audience!\"\nAt this point, I wish everyone but Seon-ah would just piss off.\n\"Young Master! Hayeon! How are you~?\"\nOblivious to the situation inside, Ouyang Mun's cheerful voice echoed from beyond the door.\n“ Sigh . Let him in.”\nA moment later, the door opened and Ouyang Mun walked with a little box in his hands.\n\"Hayeon! Look what I caught this time...\"\nOuyang Mun, who’d burst in all excited to show off a present for his crush, just stopped dead in his tracks like a broken puppet.\nThen he snapped out of it and started scrambling to greet everyone.\n\"Greetings, First Young Master! Greetings, Third Young Master! Greetings, Sixth Young Master!\"\nOnce the greetings were done, he flipped his social switch and immediately started chatting up a storm with my senior brothers.\n\"Congratulations, Third Young Master! I would be honored to witness your Shadowless Fourteen Moves! Hahaha.”\n“ Ahem . Hmm. W-Well, I wouldn’t mind showing you.”\nAs I watched these crazy bastards making a racket in someone else's home, I noticed my Sixth Brother smiling contentedly in silence.\n“Are you alright, Sixth Brother?”\n“Hehehe. This is much better than being alone in my quarters.”\n\"Is that so?\"\n\"When I'm alone, I tend to see things that aren't there and hear phantom sounds that disturb my mind. But with eleven people gathered together like this, I don't see or hear any illusions.\"\n\"...\"\nI was speechless at his words and carefully checked the room.\nAfter counting the people present, I cautiously said,\n“T-There are only nine people here, Sixth Brother.”\nEven including Kwan Mu-yeol outside, there were only ten.\nThree brothers. Jin Hayeon and Ouyang Mun. Two guard warriors. Plus Hang Geon and Seon-ah.\nIncluding Il-mok, ten people had gathered in Windrock Palace, their lively chatter causing time to pass in a blur.\nAt least the two guard warriors kept their mouths shut, but from Il-mok's perspective of wanting quiet rest, it hardly made a difference.\nAnd that horrible time came to an end thanks to the human doorbell Kwan Mu-yeol.\n\"The Heavenly Demon Descends! Ten Thousand Demons Obeys! All Hail the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons!”\nTwo hours had passed in a flash, signaling the start of my training session with the Heavenly Demon.\nWith the Heavenly Demon's arrival, the visitors dispersed like receding tidewater, leaving only the sound of my relieved sigh in Windrock Palace.\n“Let’s begin your training.”\nWhich meant I was about to be worked like a dog.\nAnd while Il-mok was being worked to the bone by the Heavenly Demon.\n\"Hyah!\nBack at the Hyeokryeon Family estate, Seon-ah practiced the Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art alone on the training grounds.\nAnd from beyond the training ground wall, someone was watching her with a look of fond satisfaction.\n'Hohoho. Perhaps in the future, my granddaughter might become the next Family Head.'\nAs a cult that revered martial arts, the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult was a place where even women could become family heads as long as they were the strongest within the family.\nBut Hyeokryeon Cheongang was unaware of what Seol-ah was thinking as she focused on her training. ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ novel{f}ire.net\nCrack!\nSeon-ah's nails pierced the heart of the wooden training dummy. She stared at her reddened nails, a thoughtful frown creasing her brow.\n‘I need to become stronger… so I can stay by Big Brother’s side.’\nSeon-ah might be young, but she wasn't stupid.\nThe child knew.\nThe people who took away her time with Il-mok were mostly those of a higher rank than her and Il-mok.\nPeople like the First Young Master, the Third Young Master, and the Heavenly Demon.\nThat's why the child thought.\n'I have to become strong. Stronger than anyone else.'\nSo that no one could dare interfere with her time with Il-mok.\nSlash!\nSeol-ah's fingernails drew a crimson arc, cleanly slicing the wooden dummy's head in half.\n\"Whew.\"\nAs Seon-ah regulated her breathing, the red energy lingering in her eyes and hair had grown noticeably deeper.\nLate at night, when everyone was fast asleep.\nThe moon was behind the clouds, and Windrock Palace was painted pitch-black.\nA pale white figure hidden in darkness moved like a ghost toward Il-mok's quarters.\nIt was an eerie sight.\nThe door opened and closed silently, leaving no trace of its passage as if it had never been opened.\nAnd the shadow that had infiltrated Il-mok's room under the cover of darkness stared down at the deeply sleeping Il-mok.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 36 : Intoxication (2)",
    "content": "Chapter 36: Intoxication (2)\nA world painted entirely in black and white.\nIn a stark corner of this monochrome world, I was waving something around.\nIt was bizarre to watch myself, yet I felt no sense of strangeness.\nI just stood there, blankly observing what I was doing.\nAs I continued to watch, I finally realized what I was wielding. Googlᴇ search noveⅼfire.net\nA brush.\nThen it dawned on me. The world wasn't made of black and white.\nI was the one painting the white world black.\n\"This isn't right!!\"\nAnd then I—the one wielding the brush—screamed in frustration, blacking out what I had written before writing new characters.\n'Man… What a nutcase.'\nThat was my first thought as I watched my other self, accompanied by an inexplicable sense of foreboding.\nThe scene was familiar.\nLately, I had been repeating that very same antic every single night.\nAfter realizing the onset of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's side effect, I'd been trying to figure out a fix.\nBut I couldn’t come up with a way to get rid of them completely, so I settled for the next-best thing.\nIf obsessive-compulsive disorder were inevitable, I might as well channel it into a specific outlet.\nEssentially, I wrote my diary every night while obsessively correcting my handwriting.\nThe idea was to stop any other obsessive symptoms from popping up.\nThe raving lunatic before me was, in essence, me —or rather, a version of me consumed by the worsening side effect.\nI still get urges to fix things now and then, but because I’ve funneled all that crazy into my handwriting, it doesn’t happen very often.\nI’d actually been feeling pretty good about it, but maybe deep down I was scared of turning into… that.\nAnd as soon as I thought that, what was happening right now suddenly made sense.\n'Is this what they call Qi Deviation?'\nBut I quickly dismissed the thought. I wasn’t meditating or circulating energy.\nDrawing on my hazy memories, the last thing I remembered was going to bed.\nWhich meant...\n'This is just a nightmare.'\nThe moment I realized this was all a nightmare.\n\"Phew.\"\nThe image of my frantic self vanished, replaced by darkness.\nThe reason for the darkness was simple. My eyes were still closed.\nFlick .\nI opened my eyes forcefully to shake off the unsettling nightmare, but strangely, everything remained pitch black.\nWas I still dreaming? Or was today particularly dark?\nAs these thoughts crossed my mind, a faint moonlight filtered through the paper windows, as if the clouds had finally parted.\nThe light bounced off something small and faint that had been hiding in the dark, and it caught my eye.\nI narrowed my eyes and peered at it for a second, trying to figure out what that tiny flicker of light was.\nIt didn't take long to realize what it was.\nEyes.\nTiny, narrowed eyes, inches from my own, stared with unsettling intensity.\n“HOLY SHIT!!!”\nI cursed in shock, jerking upright as if having a seizure.\nAs I moved, the eyes hovering near my face retreated.\nGoosebumps erupted across my skin at the terrifying sight of disembodied pupils floating in the air.\n\"Th-this is fucked.\"\nI thought this forsaken cult only housed madmen, but were there ghosts too?\nThen the darkness below those ghostly eyes split open, and a faint light leaked through.\nIt was human teeth.\n\"Are you alright, youngest?\"\nAnd the voice that emerged from the ghost's mouth was quite familiar.\n\"Third Brother?\"\nIt was the voice of Third Brother, the delusional assassin plagued by paranoia.\nHe used to visit me at night, but he’d stopped after I asked him to come during the day.\nRight then, two assigned guards rushed in and called out.\n\"What's wrong, Young Master?\"\n\"Are you alright!?\"\nA heartbeat later, Jin Hayeon’s voice followed.\n\"Young Master!\"\nOnly after hearing their voices did I finally gather my wits and respond in the calmest tone I could manage.\n\"Don't worry. Third Brother came to visit, and we were just having a conversation.\"\nI answered while reminding myself that I was essentially a hostage.\nIf I were to call for help here, Third Brother would slice my throat faster than they could burst into the room.\nBut oblivious to my predicament, Kwan Mu-yeol's voice boomed from beyond the door.\n\"Third Young Master, sneaking in at such a late hour shows disrespect to us!\"\nWhy were these supposed guards provoking an assassin who had come in the dead of night?\nAs cold sweat ran down my back, Third Senior replied in a gloomy tone.\n\"I merely came because I suddenly had something to ask our youngest. I'll be more mindful next time.\"\nHearing Third Brother's apology, the guards and Jin Hayeon eventually withdrew.\nBreaking the silence that fell between just the two of us, I cautiously asked.\n\"So, what brings you here at this late hour?\"\n'Why the hell are you here again, you crazy bastard?!' almost slipped out of my mouth, but I managed to hold it back.\nI'd already cursed in my surprise, but since it was in Korean, it would likely go unnoticed.\n\"Because of what happened during the day.\"\n\"During the day?\"\nWhen I asked with a puzzled expression, Third Brother nodded in the darkness and replied.\n\"During the day, I felt awkward. I thought everyone was praising me. But tonight, I keep thinking, I wonder if you were all making fun of me for being so easily flustered. Were you all secretly laughing at me, thinking, ‘Is this all you are proud of?’”\n\"......\"\nThey say people become more emotional at night, but it seems Third Brother became more paranoid instead.\n'Well... Progress… I guess??'\nThe man who had been depressed all day now was only depressed at night, so that was progress of sorts.\nCome to think of it, his stealth skills seemed to have improved compared to when he first started visiting at night.\nBack then, I could at least vaguely discern his shape in the moonlight.\nNow, even bathed in moonlight, only his eyes glinted faintly. And that was only because he’d leaned inches from my face.\nWhile I was lost in these thoughts, Third Brother brought up something out of the blue.\n\"More importantly, are you alright?\"\n\"???\"\n\"Actually, I was going to wait until you woke up since you were sleeping so soundly. But you were whimpering as if you were having a nightmare. So I was debating whether to wake you and then you woke up.\"\n\"Ah...\"\nSo that's why he had his face so close. And here I thought he was contemplating how to kill me.\n\"Ahem. I did have a nightmare, but it's nothing serious.\"\n\"That's truly a relief.\"\n\"Yes. And don't worry. Everyone's congratulations earlier were genuine.\"\n\"Hmm. If it's coming from our youngest who is sharp enough to read even Master's thoughts, it must be true.\"\nSatisfied, he nodded and turned to leave.\nBut just before leaving the room, he turned back as if suddenly remembering something and asked.\n\"By the way, what was that word you shouted when you woke up? Si-pal? Shi-bal? It was my first time hearing it.\"\n\"......\"\nSurvival instincts kicked my brain into overdrive.\n\"Th-that was a local expression from my hometown. It's, it's a kind of dialect. Like 'Oh my!' or 'Good gracious!' That sort of meaning. Y-yes, that's exactly it. Ha, hahaha.\"\n“Oh really? An expression. Fascinating. Ssi-bal. It rolls right off the tongue.\"\nAnd with that, Third Senior kept muttering ssi-bal to himself like a foreigner practicing Korean for the first time.\nFeeling a sense of dread, I quickly started talking again.\n\"Ah! Come to think of it, while Eldest Brother and the others might not be interested, why don't you try talking with Ouyang Mun?\"\n\"You mean that energetic fellow we saw earlier today?\"\n\"Yes. Didn't he say he wanted to see your Shadowless Fourteen Moves firsthand? If you two spar a little, you’d have a better understanding of whether he was mocking you or being sincere. Ha. Hahaha.\"\n“I see. That’s not a bad idea at all.”\nNodding as if pleased, Senior opened the door and left.\n‘…Rest in peace, Ouyang Mun.’\nThere was a chance that a maidenless young man might evolve into a virgin ghost tonight.\nThe next day.\nI couldn't tell if it was good news or bad news, but neither my Third Brother nor Ouyang Mun paid me a visit.\nAnd neither was Sixth Brother.\nThanks to their absence, Windrock Palace was much quieter, but I couldn't shake off an uneasy feeling.\n'Don’t tell me one of them is actually dead.'\nThere was a ninety-nine percent chance it would be Ouyang Mun if someone had died, but that didn't explain why Third Brother hadn't shown up.\n'Is he busy disposing of the body…’\nI wanted to ponder this grim thought, but...\n“Hahaha! And so, what I’m saying is—”\n\"So, that’s what happened. Hahaha.\"\nEldest Brother and Hang Geon's constant chatter prevented any serious contemplation.\nThe topic of their conversation was the school program they were in charge of because of me.\nWhat puzzled me was why they felt the need to come report to me about it almost every day.\nHang Geon was understandable; he’s my subordinate after all. But I am not Eldest Brother’s superior.\nI figured it was part of his weird plan to get my approval so he could become my liege someday, but—\n‘…This whole approach is just wrong.’\nNot only did the approach feel wrong, but I had no intention of serving Eldest Brother as my liege.\nIn fact, once I entered the Hall of the Demonic Way, I planned to slack off and enjoy life. I had no intention of serving anyone as my liege.\n\"Hahaha. That was a brilliant decision, Eldest Brother.\"\nOf course, telling the guy with the anger management issues what I really thought was a terrible idea, so I just played along with some flattery.\nAfter they finally finished their little report—or maybe it was just bragging, I couldn't tell—and left, only the usual resident remained.\nI asked Jin Hayeon. \"By the way, didn't you say Eldest Brother also entered the Hall of the Demonic Way as the top seat?\"\nIf a guy with a complex about being dumb could enter at the top, I had to wonder just how high the bar was set at that academy.\nIt made me wonder if I really needed to study and train this hard.\n\"Despite the First Young Master's inferiority complex concerning his wisdom, he wasn't inherently lacking. He just didn't meet the standards expected of the Supreme One's disciple.\"\nSo he had average intelligence at best.\n\"The Hall of the Demonic Way's entrance exam involves an interview and a duel. The First Young Master barely scraped by the interview, but his martial arts prowess secured him the top rank.\"\nI nodded in response to the explanation, concluding that it made sense.\n'The interview is one thing, but isn’t the duel basically a free pass??'\nIt seemed the stronger you were, the more bonus points you received.\n'Well, Eldest Brother did reach the Extremity in his early twenties and earned the title of Mad Demon for rampaging across the Central Plains like it was his own backyard.'\nNow, in his early forties, he'd mastered the Raging Demon Sword Art. His martial arts talent was indisputably exceptional.\nJust as I was digging into the dirt on my senior brother's college admissions fraud…\n\"The Heavenly Demon Descends! Ten Thousand Demons Obeys!\"\nJang Hwi's shout came from the entrance of the Windrock Palace.\nIt meant Master was coming for his scheduled visit.\nAs soon as she heard the call, Seon-ah, who'd been glued to my side, got up to leave.\n\"I greet the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons.\"\n“Hohoho. Return safely, little one.”\nMaster and Seon-ah exchanged brief greetings. Then, he produced a small box from his sleeve.\n\"Here's the Explosive Demonic Pill I promised.\"\n\"!!!\"\nA legendary elixir. The kind of thing you read about in every martial arts story, but I’d never actually seen one in real life.\nHowever, instead of being overjoyed, I was a little suspicious.\n\"Master, last time you said my skills were still lacking and it was too early for me to consume the Explosive Demonic Pill.\"\n\"Hohoho. Haven't you built up a solid foundation by now? Of course, your dantian is still too small to fully handle the Explosive Demonic Pill properly. But I don’t want to keep delaying your reward, so I'll personally guide your absorption process with True Qi Guidance.\"\nI prostrated myself at Master's explanation.\n\"Your grace is boundless!\"\n\"Hahahaha. Excessive formality is unnecessary. Get up. I’m not doing this solely out of my affection for you. This is part of your reward for your excellent suggestions regarding the school program.\"\nMaster went on and on about his justification for it, but none of that really mattered.\nWhat mattered was that I was about to consume an elixir.\nWhat was an elixir?\nIf you compared martial arts to modern sports, it was like doping.\nPerformance enhancement!\nOf course, elixirs weren't always good.\nCompatibility was key. The wrong elixir for the wrong constitution could be disastrous. Hence the need for specialists to tailor the dosages and ingredients to each individual.\nIn that sense, having Master personally assist with the elixir absorption was an incredible stroke of luck.\nAfter all, he was the leading expert in this field.\n\"Take the Explosive Demonic Pill and sit in lotus position.\"\nI took the small pill from the box Master handed me and assumed the lotus position.\n'Hehehe. Once I absorb this, passing the entrance exam is a sure thing.'\nAccording to what I'd just heard from Jin Hayeon, the duel carried more weight than the interview. With sufficient strength, simply avoiding utter failure in the interview was enough.\n\"Once you swallow the pill, absolutely do not open your mouth. Also, you must not lose consciousness, and maintain focus on the energy flow I will be guiding.”\nFollowing Master's warnings and instructions, I swallowed the Explosive Demonic Pill I'd been holding, and Master placed his palm on my back.\nAs the small pill I'd swallowed began to dissolve and release an enormous energy, an equally powerful force invaded my body through Master's palm on my back.\nI focused my mind, determined not to die a pathetic death from consuming an elixir.\nBut a nagging feeling lingered in the back of my mind.\nThat I had forgotten something really important.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 37 : Intoxication (3)",
    "content": "Chapter 37: Intoxication (3)\nMaster's immense energy surged from his palm through my back and encased the Explosive Demonic Pill's volatile energy raging within my meridians.\nUp to this point, nothing seemed unusual. It was a straightforward process.\nHowever, I didn't realize then that this was just the beginning.\nMaster’s massive energy wrapped around the pill’s wild power. Despite being intertwined, the energies remained distinct, becoming even more immense upon merging.\nThen, that immense energy began burrowing into my frail, underdeveloped meridians that could barely handle five years' worth of internal energy.\n\"!!!\"\nMy eyes flew open at the unexpected, intense pain, and I nearly let out a scream.\nEven while it hurt like hell, one thought managed to cut through the haze.\n'So this is why he warned me not to faint or open my mouth!'\nOf course, Master wasn't simply cramming all that whole giant blob of energy into my meridians like an idiot.\nLike drawing a thread from a spool, he used his own internal energy to carefully guide the pill's potent force.\n'But even that’s too much for my meridians!'\n\"Hng!!!\"\nI clenched my teeth so hard they might break from trying to endure the pain. Even without looking at a mirror, I knew my face was currently contorted in agony.\nMeanwhile, the pill's energy continued to ravage my meridians, following the path carved by Master's internal energy.\n—Don't lose track of the flow of energy guided by this old man.\nClutching to that warning like a lifeline, I forced myself to focus on the energy’s movement with every shred of my being.\nIronically, once I concentrated on something else, the pain became somewhat more bearable.\nFurthermore—\nThump!\nI began to grasp what was happening within me.\n'So my meridians weren’t narrow to begin with.'\nThe Explosive Demonic Pill's energy wasn't tearing my meridians apart. To be precise, it was surging through while forcefully cleansing out the impurities that had accumulated throughout my body.\nIn other words, the pain I was feeling was from those impurities being forcibly expelled from where they had blocked my meridians.\nPerhaps because they’d been purged, refreshing and soothing sensations gradually replaced the agony in areas the energy had passed through.\nThis, however, was agonizing in its own way.\n'Urgh!!'\nFresh pain erupted at the forefront where the energy drilled forward, while relief washed over the cleared meridians behind. This unsettling blend of agony and ecstasy threatened to push me beyond some indefinable boundary.\nHow long did I endure this torment, locked in battle against myself?\n'It's... it's finally over...'\nAdhering to the circulation method of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, the energy surged through the final meridian and stormed into my dantian.\nOr so I thought.\n'!?'\nFor some reason, instead of settling to the dantian, the Explosive Demonic Pill's energy was heading back toward the meridians as if planning to do another round of its tour.\nThe thought ‘I'm doomed’ flooded my mind, but surprisingly, the second round only caused little pain, perhaps because the initial run had cleared most of the impurities.\nAnd just as it was finally completing the second circuit and returning to my dantian…\n'!?'\nThis crazy old coot started directing the Explosive Demonic Pill's energy back into my meridians again.\n‘Oh come on?!'\nBefore I could even finish that thought, the crazy old man showed me the reason himself.\n'Why there!?'\nUnder Master's guidance, the surging energy splintered into dozens of smaller fragments, diverting from the major meridians into the network of finer vessels throughout my body.\nA realization struck me.\n'You fucking old coot, if you could split it into smaller pieces, why didn’t you just do that from the start?!'\nI get it now. It wasn't that he couldn't break it down smaller. He just didn't.\nAnd I understood why he did that.\nIt was to maintain sufficient energy to forcefully push out the impurities blocking the meridians in one go.\nBut it didn't change the fact that I had suffered terribly because of this crazy old man.\nAnd now, these dozens of fragmented energy streams were delivering a new kind of pain.\nIf the pain of clearing the major meridians felt like being repeatedly jabbed with something blunt all over my body, clearing the minor meridians now felt like having dozens of ants crawling inside my body and biting everywhere.\nIt was horrific torture.\nI couldn't tell if I was absorbing an elixir or being tortured.\nJust as I teetered on the brink of unconsciousness, ready to surrender to oblivion—\n\"Well done. You endured well.\"\nMaster's voice sounded from behind me.\n'Endured my ass.'\nI really almost died.\nTorrents of profanities were already at the tip of my tongue, but—\n\"Hmm?\"\nWhen I finally came to my senses, I experienced a sensation I'd never felt before in my life.\nHow should I describe it?\nIt felt like suddenly being cured of a lifelong illness.\nMy body felt incredibly light, better than ever before.\nThough physically impossible, I felt like I could actually fly through the sky.\n\"Hohoho. Quite amazing, isn't it?\"\n\"Is this the power of the elixir, Master?\"\nI could understand why martial artists would go crazy over elixirs, but for some reason, Master shook his head.\n\"Your internal energy hasn't increased that much. This is less due to the elixir and more the result of Bone Marrow Cleansing.\"\n\"!?\"\nI inspected my dantian and realized my internal energy didn’t increase that much.\nPerhaps only about ten years' worth of internal energy?\nSince my dantian could initially hold only about five years' worth of internal energy, it had now tripled in capacity.\nIt is said that the Explosive Demonic Pill contained about 30 years' worth of energy, so effectively, only about one-third had been added to my dantian.\nBut more important than that was the word Bone Marrow Cleansing.\nBone Marrow Cleansing.\nThe term, common in martial arts novels, referred to a procedure performed on newborns in prestigious families or large sects.\nIt was a crucial procedure in which a master used their internal energy to refine an infant's bones and meridians, making them ideal for martial arts cultivation.\n\"But, isn't Bone Marrow Cleansing only possible for young children?\"\n\"Hohoho. It becomes more difficult with age, but it's not exclusively limited to young children.\" Follow current novels on novel⦿fire.net\n\"I hadn't initially planned to perform Bone Marrow Cleansing. Even for me, attempting it on a fifteen-year-old boy would be a gamble. My intention was to simply remove the impurities from your major meridians and conclude the process.”\n\"Then why...?\"\n\"First, your body harbored far fewer impurities than I anticipated. Likely due to a childhood lacking in proper cooked meals and meat. Furthermore, your remarkable endurance allowed me to preserve more of the Explosive Demonic Pill's energy than expected. However, your dantian was too small to contain such potent energy. Thus, I had no choice but to extend the cleansing to your smaller meridians.\"\nComing from a poor family and later becoming an orphan, I hadn't been able to eat well. Yet, that had turned out to be a blessing in disguise.\n\"Your body now possesses the purity of a newborn who has undergone Bone Marrow Cleansing. While your immediate gains in internal energy are modest, your potential for future growth has greatly increased.\"\nBut as I listened to the explanation, one question came to mind.\n\"But Master, is Bone Marrow Cleansing possible with just twenty years' worth of internal energy?\"\nIf it were feasible with so little energy, wouldn't all martial arts families perform Bone Marrow Cleansing on all their children?\nMaster chuckled.\n\"Hahaha. How could that be possible? To preserve the pill's energy, I relied mostly on my own power.\"\n\"!!!\"\nIt then dawned on me that, throughout the cleansing process, Master's internal energy had been enveloping the pill's energy all along. In other words, the energy directly confronting the impurities was mostly the Master's internal energy, not the Explosive Demonic Pill's.\nThe fact that the pill still retained one-third of its total accumulated energy meant that Master had expended at least thirty years of his own energy.\n\"Thank you, Master!\"\nGratitude washed over me, erasing the lingering resentment.\n\"Think nothing of it. Your late entry into the martial arts was my only regret, but now that disadvantageous condition has been eliminated.\"\nDespite losing decades of energy—something more precious than life to a martial artist—he wore a satisfied smile, happier than I, the recipient of this fortune.\nFollowing the elixir absorption and Bone Marrow Cleansing procedure, I changed into fresh training clothes provided by Jin Hayeon.\nMy previous clothes reeked from the expelled impurities.\nAfter swinging my sword several times under Master's watchful eye.\n'This is insane.'\nI couldn't help but be amazed at the effects of Bone Marrow Cleansing.\nBefore, it was just a vague feeling of being lighter. But now that I was actually trying to move and use my power, the difference was night and day.\nMy internal energy flowed unimpeded through my widened meridians. It was like going from a single-lane country road to a four-lane freeway.\nMoreover, since even the smaller meridians had been cleansed, there was no such thing as energy blockage.\nIf there was one problem, it was that the meridians had become too large compared to my internal energy.\nThey were now so spacious that they could comfortably handle fifteen years’ worth of cultivation all at once. As a result, the power and speed I could generate in an instant were far greater and faster, but I could not maintain it for long.\nBut that was a tiny, insignificant issue.\n'Since my meridians have widened, the amount of energy I can absorb through meditation has greatly increased too.'\nAnd sure enough, once I ran out of energy and done another breathing exercise, my internal energy replenished at an astonishing rate.\nI wonder… is this how all those pampered brats who got the treatment as babies have been training all their lives?\nThe disparity between them and those like me would only widen with age.\nBy adulthood, they’d flaunt titles like Five Dragons and Two Phoenixes while spouting arrogant drivel such as,\n—I earned this through hard work! Your mediocrity is due to your laziness!\nI could just picture some smug, blue-blooded young master saying shit like that.\n'So even in the martial arts world, you need to be born with a golden spoon.'\nOr win the lottery like me.\n\"Hehehe.\"\nHaving the Heavenly Demon as my master was a jackpot in itself.\nHow long had I been training the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword while being intoxicated by the elixir and Bone Marrow Cleansing effects?\nMovements that once felt awkward now flowed seamlessly.\nThe power and speed were incomparable to before, making wielding the sword incredibly enjoyable.\nWhen my internal energy ran out, I would meditate, and when my dantian filled up, I would swing the sword again.\n'No. I need to swing faster here.'\n‘Not good enough! The pacing is all wrong! Slow down at the very end so it flows into the next move!’\nWith each sword swing, I would identify even the smallest imperfection, and after recovering my energy, I would work on fixing those flaws.\n“Hahaha. Well, this old man will be heading out.”\n“Take care, Master! And thank you again for everything!”\nMaster departed Windrock Palace as the sun dipped below the horizon.\nEven after the sun had hidden behind the mountains and darkness had fallen.\nWhoosh!\nWhoosh!\n'Still not enough!'\nLost in my pursuit of perfect swordsmanship, I continued to practice tirelessly.\nHow long had I been lost in this sword-drunk state?\n\"Huff. Huff.\"\nWhen a coppery tang filled my mouth, my muscles screamed in protest, and my sword-gripping palm finally felt a searing ache.\nOnly then did I come to my senses and realize an important fact I had forgotten.\nWhen you take an elixir, your skill in martial arts is obviously going to level up. And with Bone Marrow Cleansing on top of that, my mastery of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword had skyrocketed.\nAnd my increased mastery of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword meant its side effect had also worsened.\nI realized that all this time, I had been swinging my sword like a madman, intoxicated by the side effect.\nThanks to that, I had made incredible progress in just one day, but that wasn’t the important thing here.\nMemories of last night’s nightmare resurfaced.\nMaybe that nightmare wasn’t a nightmare, but in fact, a premonition.",

    "novel_title": "So, Did Someone Force You to Become the Heavenly Demon",
    "chapter_number": "Chapter 38 : Obsessive Compulsion",
    "content": "Chapter 38: Obsessive Compulsion\nWhen I really thought about it, this was way more serious than the nightmare had suggested.\nThe fact that my obsessive-compulsive symptoms targeted martial arts, not just handwriting, was especially concerning.\nPerfecting one's handwriting?\nWhile standards of 'perfection' vary from person to person, most people have an ideal writing style in their minds.\nFrom my modern perspective, it's like aiming for the precision of standard computer fonts—like Gulim, Batang, or Gungsuh.\nAchieving that level of precision would require considerable effort, but—\n'Compared to martial arts, that's nothing more than child's play.'\nThe Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, in particular, had an impossibly high ceiling.\nThe Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword consisted of twenty-two forms and I’d only mastered fourteen of them. Yet its simplicity was deceptive.\nEach form of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword was closer to concepts rather than clearly defined movements.\nLet’s take a look at the first form of the Demonic Art, the Soul-Departing Sword. It was a simultaneous offensive and defensive maneuver, executed when drawing the sword to strike or block a surprise attack.\nThe concept itself was the Soul-Departing Sword.\nIt doesn’t matter if I step back and swing horizontally as I draw my sword, or thrust forward as I advance. Both were the Soul-Departing Sword. The sword departed from the sheath to sever the enemy’s neck, hence soul-departing.\nThe same principle applied to Soul-Cutting Flash and Soul-Guiding Sword.\nSoul-Cutting Flash was a concise and rapid thrust, but thrusting itself could be aimed at the opponent’s head, their feet, or their heart.\nAlthough classified as the same thrust, the detailed movements were fundamentally different. A thrust aimed high at the head differed fundamentally from one aimed low at the feet. Thus, a single Soul-Cutting Flash could manifest in dozens, even hundreds of variations, depending on its application.\nThen there was the Soul-Guiding Sword which started from the same stance as the Soul-Cutting Flash but was slower in movement. It was a technique aimed at creating openings by changing the sword's path mid-thrust and exploiting that very opening.\nThe Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword wasn't about fixed movements but rather taught concepts about thrusting, cutting, and defense, allowing each form to be applied in dozens of different variations.\nThe real issue lay in the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's true essence, its ultimate goal.\nThe Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword was a sword style where all forms flowed continuously, gradually cornering the opponent and draining their spirit.\nFourteen stances, each with countless variations, had to flow seamlessly into one another, regardless of order.\nTaking all that into account, the number of possible combinations exceeded tens of thousands.\nAnd I was to make all of that perfect.\n'This is a perfect recipe for madness.'\nIt made me wonder if the side effect was actually a feature, not a bug. By forcing an obsessive pursuit of perfection, it drove practitioners to master this unreasonable Demonic Art through sheer, compulsive, madness-fueled dedication.\nBut the philosophy behind the art wasn't the big issue right now.\nThe problem was my growing mastery of it.\n\"Ha.\"\nHours bled into one another in a blur of motion. By the time I stopped, my limbs trembled with exhaustion.\n\"Are you alright, Young Master?\"\nJin Hayeon, who had been observing, spoke as I finally ceased my practice. Fresh chapters posted on novel※fire.net\n\"I should rest for today.\"\n\"That's a wise decision. It's already past the Hour of the Pig (9-11 PM). You should rest for tomorrow.\"\nAfter saying this, Jin Hayeon prepared warm water for my bath.\nAfter a refreshing shower and a soothing soak, a wave of exhaustion washed over my body which had been swinging the sword for hours under obsessive compulsion. My whole body screamed at me to collapse onto the bed and pass out immediately.\n\"...\"\nBut as I entered my room, I froze.\nI can’t think of what I’m supposed to do in my current situation.\nMy body craved the bed, but my gaze remained fixed on a certain spot.\n—I need to write in my diary before sleeping.\n—It's part of my daily routine\n—I need to perfect my handwriting.\nIt was like a little voice was whispering that stuff in the back of my head.\nEarly the next morning.\nJin Hayeonz asked with her usual stoic expression as she brought me my breakfast.\n\"Are you alright, Young Master? You look exhausted.”\nAs she said, I felt like I was dying from exhaustion. It must have been visible on my face.\n\"I didn't get enough sleep last night.\"\nI had tried to ignore the diary and sleep. I even managed to drag myself to bed. However—\n‘Thoughts of unfinished tasks kept appearing in my mind, making it impossible to fall asleep.’\nIn the end, I gave up and could only fall asleep after writing in my diary.\nIt was a torturous experience.\n—This motherfucker Demonic Art!\n—I’m dying of exhaustion, yet why the fuck am I writing in this damned diary at this hour?\n—My hands kept shaking, my writing looked dog shit! Motherfucker, I need to fix this!\n—Sleep, you bastard! SLEEEEP!\nI was using my diary to complain about the Demonic Art's side effect, but the only reason I was writing in the first place was the side effect.\nThe irony was maddening. I barely managed to sleep after furiously writing like a madman for hours.\nAnd now I had woken up after barely four hours of sleep.\nJin Hayeon listened to my whole story, then she furrowed her delicate brow for a second and came up with something completely out of left field.\n\"Why don't you ask Warrior Kwan about this?\"\n\"Warrior Kwan?\"\nShe was referring to Kwan Mu-yeol, one of my two recently assigned bodyguards.\nHowever, I couldn't understand why he was being brought up here.\nResponding to my confusion, Jin Hayeon answered in her characteristically blunt manner.\n“From what I know, Warrior Kwan also practices Demonic Art with side effect similar to yours.”\n\"!!!\"\n\"His level is also higher than yours, so he probably knows some ways to control the side effect.\"\n\"That's a brilliant idea!\"\nIt felt like a lifeline had been thrown down while the sky was falling.\nI quickly summoned Kwan Mu-yeol to my room.\n\"Is there a problem?\" Kwan Mu-yeol asked in a tone as stoic as Jin Hayeon's, and I briefly explained what had happened last night and about the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword before asking.\n\"I heard from Miss Jin that you also experience similar side effect. Is that true?\"\n\"Though slightly different, I do suffer from an obsessive compulsion.\"\n\"How do you cope with them?\"\nIn response to my question, Kwan Mu-yeol frowned and countered.\n\"Since the side effect helps you improve with the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, is there really a need to think about it so negatively?\"\nThis was typical thinking for those obsessed with martial arts.\nActually, he had a point.\nBeing a perfectionist isn't always a bad thing. The compulsion was stressful, yes, but the sense of accomplishment from a perfectly completed task was immense.\n'It was the same when I was practicing the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword yesterday.'\nWhenever I felt something was off, I'd obsessively practice to fix it, but it wasn't pure torture.\nThat's why I became more deeply immersed in the sword, and why the obsessive symptoms worsened.\nBut I didn't want to live like that. My dream was to laze and feast, not grind myself into madness.\nBut since I couldn't reveal my dream here, I decided to subtly push my justification.\n“Look, martial arts is a long road, correct? Overdoing it for fast gains just leaves you useless the next day. There's a need to know when to start and when to stop.”\nSeemingly convinced by my logic, Kwan Mu-yeol pondered for a moment before saying, \"The simplest method is to create a conflicting compulsion.\"\n\"???\"\nSeeing my confusion, he elaborated. \"Miss Jin told me you were already very strict with your daily schedule, even before the side effect appeared.\"\n\"...\"\nIt hit me then that what felt totally normal for a student cramming for exams must look like a full-blown obsession to everyone else.\n\"If you develop a true compulsion with that schedule, it will prevent you from excessive training. The satisfaction of adhering to the schedule will conflict with the guilt of interrupting training, allowing you to stop, albeit with some unease.\"\nHe spoke as if recounting a personal experience.\n‘Fight poison with poison, huh?’\nUsing compulsion to block compulsion—it sounded absurd, but also somewhat plausible.\nEspecially since the person saying this was speaking from experience.\nThough I had gained some useful information, I still had questions, so I asked Kwan Mu-yeol further.\n\"What if that fails? What if external circumstances prevent you from fulfilling your compulsion?\"\nAs I asked, a specific example came to mind.\n\"Like our trip to Kuqa and Hejing Counties. My injury prevented me from training, as Master instructed.”\nKwan Mu-yeol's expression soured at the memory.\nHis previous fussiness now made sense. It wasn't because he was a hardass, but a manifestation of his deeper obsession.\nMore precisely, it was the self-loathing that came from not being able to perfectly follow Master's instructions. And the fact that I was the cause of that self-loathing.\n'This isn't just his problem anymore.'\nWhat if I were in the middle of one of my sword-swinging fits, and someone came in, tied me up, and took my sword away?\n'While I might be fine now, once my level increases, I might foam at the mouth and have a seizure.'\nWhen this thought occurred to me, my impression of Kwan Mu-yeol changed.\n‘He actually endured that.’\nIf it were me, I'd have likely dragged him out to train or rampaged like Eldest Brother.\nI never would have gotten it before, but now that I had a taste of this obsession, I could finally understand him a little.\nIt reminded me of stories I'd heard in modern times, tales of CEOs from major foreign companies known for their perfectionism who acted like psychopaths toward their colleagues and subordinates.\nI used to just think those guys were assholes, but now that I'm dealing with this compulsion, I see it differently. They probably acted that way because if they didn't, the pressure would have made them snap.\nHowever, that didn't mean I wanted to become like them. That's why Kwan Mu-yeol's coping mechanism intrigued me. How did he deal with the crushing guilt of failing to satisfy his compulsions?\nHe met my hopeful gaze, grimaced, and thought about it for a good long while before he finally answered.\n\"When the guilt becomes unbearable... I punish myself.\"\nFor some reason, Kwan Mu-yeol's face flushed red and a dreamy expression showed on his face.\n\"!?\"\nThat creepy sight conjured a disturbing scene in my mind.\nThe image of Kwan Mu-yeol crying out, 'I'm a bad boy! Please punish me!' while a woman holding a whip stood over him.\n'Damn. The Demonic Cult is truly demonic after all.'\nDespite his seemingly normal facade, he was a demonic cultivator through and through.\n\"And recently... Ah. Never mind.\"\nKwan Mu-yeol started to say something else, then hesitated and dodged the question.\n\"There's a new method I've been trying, but it's not yet reliable. I'll share it later.\"\n\"...I understand.\"\nFor some reason, it felt like I was about to see something that would scar my pure mind, so I wisely gave up on pressing the issue.\nWhile the last part wasn't very helpful, I still gained something from the conversation with Kwan Mu-yeol.\n'Endure with conflicting obsessions.'\nBy obsessing over my daily schedule, I could prevent myself from training to the point of collapse.\nIt seemed like a viable strategy, albeit a temporary one.\nA more fundamental solution was needed, as there might be situations where adhering to the schedule was impossible.\n'As for Kwan Mu-yeol's other solution...let's keep that as a last resort.'\nIt felt like crossing a line I shouldn't cross.\nI don’t want to become a pervert.\nEven with a potential dominatrix right beside me—and believe me, she looked the part—it was a hard no.\nAnyway, after enduring my morning lessons and martial arts training with the aforementioned expert, visitors arrived at Windrock Palace during my break as usual.\nSeon-ah, Third Brother, and Hang Geon—the usual trio. But it was the person behind them that shocked me.\n\"You're alive?\" The question slipped out before I could stop myself.\n“Pardon? What do you mean by that, Young Master?” Ouyang Mun replied with a baffled expression.\n\"Ahem. It's nothing. Rather, how did you end up coming together?\"\nMy conscience was pricking me a little, so I quickly changed the subject. My Third Brother answered with a grim little smile.\n\"Haha. After hearing your story, I sought out Young Warrior Ouyang for a conversation about martial arts and I found him to be a very interesting young man.”\n\"I-Is that so?\"\n“No matter what I say, he always spins it positively. He didn't offer brilliant solutions like you, youngest, but listening to him somehow eased my mind a little.”\nOuyang Mun let out a hearty laugh. “Hahaha! How could I ever match Young Master Il-mok? I’m the one seeking his advice!”\n\"Huhu. Now that you mention it, we did have such a conversation.\"\nThird Brother nudged Ouyang Mun with his elbow, causing the latter's expression to shift uncomfortably, and he hesitantly pulled something out from his sleeve.\n\"Ahem. Hayeon! I couldn't give this to you last time because the other Young Masters were present yesterday, but during my recent mission...\"\n\"From what I hear, Young Warrior Ouyang obtained this item with great difficulty. Take a good look at it.\"\nSo there was Ouyang Mun, awkwardly trying to make a move on ice-cold Jin Hayeon, with Third Brother providing backup from the sidelines.\nIt was truly a bizarre sight.\n'What is this? A combination of Mr. Positive and Mr. Negative?'\nIf you mashed those two into one person, you’d have a textbook case of bipolar disorder.\n“If it’s something you acquired with such difficulty, it rightfully belongs with Young Warrior Ouyang.\"\nTheir combined effort, however, stopped dead before it could even sway Jin Hayeon.\nAs expected of an aspiring psychopath.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 39 : Assassination (1)",
    "content": "Chapter 39: Assassination (1)\nOnce the boisterous break ended and Windrock Palace emptied, Master arrived.\n\"I noticed your rapid progress with the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword last evening.\"\n\"All thanks to Master's guidance.\"\nMy response was a mix of conflicting emotions. I feigned respect and gratitude outwardly, but inwardly, I cursed.\n‘Damned Demonic Art!’\nThe escalating OCD was driving me nuts.\n\"Were you immersed in sword practice today as well?\"\n\"About that...\"\nAfter contemplating Master's question briefly, I answered with some honesty.\n\"Since my level rose so quickly, the side effect have worsened too, so I'm restraining myself for now.\"\nThat was putting it mildly, minus the cursing.\n\"Oh?\"\nI expected some disappointment, even a reprimand, but Master simply stroked his beard with a curious look.\nWhy?\n\"I was about to address that myself. It's commendable that you're exercising caution.\"\n\"???\"\n\"Demonic Arts, unlike those practiced by unbelievers, are known for rapid progress. The level is incomparable. Do you know how long it takes for unbelievers to become Peak Realm masters who can freely manipulate Sword Qi or Fist Qi by opening the Governing and Conception Vessels?\"\nCaught off guard by the sudden topic change, I thought for a second.\n\"I'm not sure.\"\n\"It varies a lot depending on talent and luck, but generally, people with some talent can reach Peak Realm around middle age. Even among the elite geniuses of the vast Central Plains, only those who consumed copious amounts of elixirs reached Peak Realm in their twenties. What about Demonic Arts, then?\"\n\"Hmm... If ordinary martial arts take that long, wouldn't Demonic Arts take about ten years or so?\"\n\"Hahahaha. Not a bad guess. Depending on your talent, it usually takes between five and ten years to reach what they call the Peak Realm.”\n\"F-five years?\"\n\"Hehehe. This is just an average timeframe. Your Eldest Brother only took three years. When he joined the Hall of the Demonic Way, he was already tossing Sword Qi around like it was nothing.\"\nPride tinged Master’s voice, but his laughter faded as his expression hardened.\n\"However, there is a critical flaw in Demonic Arts. You’ve felt it yourself, haven’t you?”\n“The chances of losing one’s sanity are too high.”\n\"Exactly. Therefore, being drunk on gaining power itself is very dangerous. While progressing your Demonic Art is important, being able to control yourself and refrain from progressing further until your mind stabilizes is undeniably more important than that.”\nAfter hearing the explanation, I could roughly paint how cultists trained their Demonic Arts.\nThey use the fast leveling of Demonic Arts to boost their skills quickly, but when the crazy side effects start hitting too hard, they stop. Only after they are sure that their sanity is intact and safe do they push further until the next mental breakdown. They repeat this cycle until they hit a limit and settle at that level.\nBasically, those branch members and Branch Leaders I saw on that business trip were people who halted their progress at a certain level. This explains why, even with the fast growth of Demonic Arts and their age, their levels were far lower than the much younger Jin Hayeon.\nThis constant tightrope walk fueled their growth; failure meant Qi Deviation or a total meltdown. And in case of a meltdown, nearby demonic cultivators would intervene, like the case with Eldest Brother back then.\nIt struck me then.\nPerhaps Demonic Arts were meant for those with weak talent but strong willpower.\nYou have zero talent and you are broke? No problem.\nTen years of sheer stubbornness could still get you to the Peak Realm. Everyone could become a master with enough grit. Follow current novels on novel{f}ire.net\nWhat martial art could be more ideal than this for those stubborn enough to grind even knowing they are talentless?\nThen, what happens if someone overflowing with talent but with the mental fortitude of a goldfish learns Demonic Arts?\nFrom this perspective—\n‘Damn. My compatibility with this shit is absolute garbage.’\nThis body was blessed with an absurd amount of martial talent that even Master covets. Additionally, it had undergone Bone Marrow Cleansing and is now essentially a perfect vessel for cultivation. Combined with the rapid growth of Demonic Arts, my realm might skyrocket with each cultivation session.\nThe problem was my mental fortitude.\n‘Do I have what it takes to progress further?’\nMe, whose life goal was a cushy work-life balance?\nAs the word doomed endlessly floated through my mind, Master's voice cut through.\n\"However, there's no need to fear the side effect too much. Once you surpass Extremity and achieve Transcendence, everything will be resolved. Besides, avoiding training out of fear defeats the purpose of learning Demonic Arts.\"\n‘I never wanted to learn this garbage in the first place!’\nThe words itched in my throat, but I managed to hold them back with my last ounce of patience.\n\"Understood.\"\nHow much crazier would I get with the next level?\nWhile I was stressing about that, Master continued speaking instead of immediately resuming training.\n\"And today, I have one more thing to tell you, Il-mok.\"\n\"Yes, Master.\"\n“We’ve identified those who ordered the assassination at the inn, the ones who hunted me when we first met.”\n\"!!!\"\nShock painted my face as Master listed the culprits.\n\"First, the one who tracked me and reported to the Murim Alliance, the Sober Beggar, the Eight-Knotted Beggar of the Beggar’s Gang. Second, the one who dispatched the Alliance's warriors and requested support from surrounding sects, the Chief Strategist of the Murim Alliance, Gongsun Hyeon. Finally, the one who ordered the innkeeper's death and the poisoning of my food and tea, the Murim Alliance's Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord, Jeong Yeong.\"\nJust from hearing their positions, I could tell they were all major figures. The only title that seemed even remotely manageable was the Pavilion Lord mentioned last.\nBut the truly shocking part was the Demonic Cult's intelligence network.\n\"Such detailed information. The Divine Cult's intelligence network is astounding, Master.\"\n\"Hahaha. While our Divine Cult's intelligence is indeed impressive, we learned this through the Murim Alliance itself.”\n\"???\"\n\"Remember when I said the Murim Alliance would pin the blame on me? Well, they did exactly that. They claimed that the Beggar’s Gang caught this old one's trail, and the Chief Strategist ordered the capture.\"\n\"......\"\nI almost facepalmed at their idiocy.\nWhat kind of idiots would announce their crime out loud?\nBut after hearing Master's subsequent explanation, I roughly understood why they had done so.\n\"They spread rumors that this old one escaped by taking the innkeeper and waiter hostage. They're saying they had to let me go to save the hostages, but sadly, the hostages were brutally murdered by me after I broke through the encirclement.\"\nIn short, they’d framed Master for the massacre at the inn.\n\"Using their own lies as clues, the Divine Cult tracked down the masterminds. Who ratted me out from the Beggar’s Gang and who led the Alliance's operation that day. Identifying the Sober Beggar and the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord wasn't difficult.\"\nAfter finishing the explanation, Master's expression turned solemn.\n\"Now, you decide. Will you take revenge with your own hands? Or will you entrust it to me?\"\n\"......\"\nI fell into contemplation for a moment.\nTruthfully, I wanted to dump all three on him.\nBut—\n'Something feels off.'\nHow should I put it... I was suspicious about why he was even asking me. It felt like some kind of test.\nMaybe it's just the side effect of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword messing with my head and making me overthink, but this just felt wrong.\nBesides—\n'I should avenge Uncle Taehyun myself.'\nHe was the one who looked after me when I suddenly woke up in this fourteen-year-old orphan body. Since I couldn't repay his kindness, I should at least avenge him.\n\"I will take my revenge with my own hands.\"\n\"Oh? You mean to deal with all three yourself?\"\nI shook my head at Master's question.\n“Just the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord, the one directly involved in Uncle Taehyun's death. While the Sober Beggar and the Chief Strategist played a role, I believe only Jeong Yeong was directly involved in the murder.\"\nBeyond those directly involved, there was also a practical issue.\nHow am I supposed to kill the Chief Strategist of the Murim Alliance?\nKilling him would probably require an all-out war to wipe out the entire Alliance.\nHowever, simply admitting that killing all three would be difficult wasn’t an option. That’s why I opted to target the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord.\n\"Hmm. So, you’re limiting your vengeance to those directly involved in the murder. A wise decision.\"\nSatisfied with my answer, Master stroked his beard and nodded.\n\"Then, I'll leave the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord to you. But remember, you're not even close to his level right now. They said it’s not too late for a gentleman to take revenge ten years later; dedicate yourself to your training for the sake of vengeance.\"\n\"I will do so.\"\nI gave him a fist-clasp salute, but at the same time, I was thinking…\n'Somehow, it feels like my workload has increased again.'\nI had planned to laze around after joining the Hall of the Demonic Way, but now I had another target, the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord.\n'This really is the last one.'\nOnce I kill him and avenge Uncle Taehyun, I'll truly just retire and enjoy life.\nThat night.\nThe Heavenly Demon was in his office in the main palace, doing some paperwork. He put down a letter he was reading and glanced out at the moon hanging high in the night sky.\nHe was looking east, toward the territory of the Martial Alliance.\n‘Hmm. So he wants to kill the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord himself.'\nHe recalled his youngest disciple's vow.\nIndeed, his youngest disciple's talent was outstanding.\nSo outstanding that despite a considerable amount of time being taken up by their conversation today, his youngest disciple still made progress after only an hour of training.\n‘He didn't look too happy about it. Perhaps grief for the innkeeper still weighs on him.’\nThe Heavenly Demon knew nothing of Il-mok’s true thoughts.\n'I wonder if he'll succeed in his revenge during this old one's lifetime.'\nThe Heavenly Demon was acutely aware of his dwindling lifespan. Though he couldn't put a number on it, he knew he had less than ten years left.\nJeong Yeong, while inferior to Wi Jin-hak, had surpassed Seo Wan-pyeong in skill.\nIn other words, to kill Jeong Yeong, Il-mok would need to surpass Extremity and advance several levels further at the very least. And that assuming Jeong Yeong wouldn't grow stronger in the interim, otherwise Il-mok would need to raise his level even higher.\nBut an even greater problem existed.\nThe Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord was the right-hand man of Gongsun Hyeon, the Murim Alliance's Chief Strategist.\nIn terms of rank within the Murim Alliance, he's somewhere between fourth and fifth in command.\nNot only was his level high, but he also never travels alone. Except for extremely important missions, he was always holed up in the Murim Alliance.\nIn truth, among the three, the one most vulnerable to assassination was the Eight-Knotted Beggar of the Beggar’s Gang.\nIn any case, to kill him, Il-mok had to meet one of two conditions.\nReach a level strong enough to just plow through any defense and instantly kill the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord, which means achieving Extremity with the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword at a minimum.\nOr, achieve Transcendence and set an unbreakable trap—one that even the Chief Strategist couldn't overcome—to isolate and eliminate Jeong Yeong.\nSince he knew all this, the Heavenly Demon wasn’t actually planning on letting Il-mok do the job at all.\nHe had simply informed Il-mok—as the person directly affected—of the masterminds' identities and asked for his thoughts as a minimal courtesy.\nIn other words, Il-mok's paranoia had led him to misinterpret the situation.\nBut oblivious to this, the Heavenly Demon smiled softly at the moon.\n'Hahaha. If he gets it done after I’m gone, that's fine too. Revenge takes time, after all.’\nHe was simply proud of his youngest disciple for daring to challenge such a formidable foe.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 40 : Assassination (2)",
    "content": "Chapter 40: Assassination (2)\nDespite having a new goal of assassinating the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord, there weren't any significant changes to my daily life.\nWhich was truly fortunate.\nI was trying to turn my daily schedule into a new obsession, so if my routine got messed up now, it would have been a real headache.\nBut just because my life was the same as always didn't mean things weren't changing for the people who hung around Windrock Palace.\nJin Hayeon, who lived with me in Windrock Palace, the two guardian warriors, and Seon-ah and Master, who appeared at the same time every day, were the constants in my life.\nExcept for these five, everyone else varied from day to day.\n\"Hahaha. A mission has been assigned to the White Tortoise Corps, so I won't be able to visit for a while, Young Master.\"\n\"I see.\"\nOuyang Mun occasionally dropped by like this to inform me of his absence.\nWell, he was only reporting to me for appearance's sake as his eyes kept darting toward Jin Hayeon while speaking.\n\"Hoho. Travel safely, Young Warrior Ouyang.\"\nAnd then there was my Third Senior Brother, who was apparently his new bestie, seeing him off with a smile. He was often gone too, on business for the Dark Shadow Pavilion.\n‘I couldn’t bring myself to ask what his missions were about.’\nConsidering Third Brother’s Demonic Art and the Dark Shadow Pavilion’s reputation, the word 'assassination' kept flashing in my mind.\nClad in black, swords coated in charcoal to prevent reflection, moving like shadows in the dead of night, or holing up somewhere for ages.\nThen, after all that tension and suspense, the moment their target walks past, he'd drop dead—just like in the movies.\nIt was jarring to imagine the gloomy but kind Third Brother doing jobs like that.\nOnce Ouyang Mun left, I turned to Seon-ah beside me.\n\"Seon-ah, where would you like to go after you graduate from the Hall of the Demonic Way?\"\nThis curiosity arose because I’d recently finished historical texts and started learning law books, which taught me about all the organizations within the Demonic Cult.\nThe issue was the limited career options within the cult.\nAs if intrigued by our conversation, Eldest Brother suddenly boomed with laughter.\n\"Huahahaha! How about the Red Tiger Corps that I lead? If it's the young lady from the Hyeokryeon Family, with your outstanding talent, you'd be most welcome! Hahahaha!\"\n(TL Note: Yes, it's a tiger. I guess the author was having a second thought about which unit he was leading. I even double-checked the previous chapters to be sure. It was Red Dragon Corps 적룡단 (赤龍團) in chapter 23, but tiger here.)\nThe armed forces of the Demonic Cult were organized into sixteen units, combining the colors red, blue, black, and white with the Four Divine Beasts—Dragon (龍), Tiger (虎), Tortoise (龜), and Bird (雀).\nLike Eldest Brother's Red Tiger Corps, or Ouyang Mun's White Tortoise Corps.\nEach corps typically consisted of about forty members, and each corps had different roles.\nSome units, like the White Tortoise Corps, were always heading out on missions, while others patrolled a wide area around the main headquarters.\nNestled in the Tianshan Mountain Range, on the edge of the Central Plains' Outer Regions, the cult's forces functioned much like a border patrol.\nBeyond the peak where the main headquarters was located, there were various other areas within the Tianshan Mountain Range.\nThe Hall of the Demonic Way, which I was supposed to enter, was also located on another peak in the Tianshan Mountain Range, along with a very dangerous peak called Oblivion Ridge (忘我嶺).\nTheir duties extended beyond the headquarters to include sites like the Hall of the Demonic Way and Oblivion Ridge.\n'For Oblivion Ridge, it feels more like monitoring than protecting.'\nRecalling what Jin Hayeon had told me about Oblivion Ridge, I couldn't help but shiver.\nSeon-ah clung to my sleeve and shook her head vigorously.\n\"I-I don't want to join the Red Tiger Corps because I'd have to leave the cult often.\"\n\"!!!\"\nEldest Brother’s eyes went wide at Seon-ah's rejection, but then he just laughed it off.\n“Hahaha! Nonsense! To grow as a martial artist, you need diverse experiences! No matter how cozy the cult is, holing up here won’t get you anywhere!”\nA forty-something man giving advice to a pre-teen looked exactly like the epitome of a condescending old fogey.\nAnd to top it off, Third Brother who'd suddenly gotten all gloomy, chimed in.\n\"If you don't like going outside, you probably wouldn't like our Dark Shadow Pavilion either...\"\nHis pavilion was essentially an intelligence agency, with a side of assassination. Naturally, they traveled frequently.\nBut more importantly.\n‘You can't recommend a career in spying and assassination to a twelve-year-old!’\nWorried that those men would negatively influence Seon-ah, I quickly stepped in.\n\"Hahaha. Eldest Brother, you'll be transferred soon anyway, right? And Third Brother, Dark Shadow Pavilion work seems too dangerous for young Seon-ah.\"\nHonestly, the title of Red Tiger Corps Leader felt a bit low for someone like Eldest Brother.\nRumor had it that his unit was sidelined while he was dealing with the school program at headquarters.\nSo I concluded that there might be a personnel transfer soon.\n\"And Seon-ah, if you don't want to leave the cult, how about joining the Sacred Order or the Law Enforcement Hall?\"\nThe former were bodyguards for key figures and facilities, while the latter dealt with apostates and managed the prison.\nBeyond those two, there were other options within the Demonic Cult, such as the Hyeokryeon Family she belonged to, the Logistics Office that managed food in the Demonic Cult, the Hidden Guard Pavilion (隱衛閣) that Jin Hayeon belonged to, and the Council of Elders. However, Seon-ah wouldn't be joining the last.\nThe Council of Elders of the Demonic Cult was a unique entity. From my modern perspective, it was like a gathering of honorary retirees who couldn't make it to the executive level.\nIt was a place for those who had risen through politics and such but lacked the Transcendence-level skills to lead. So, they stepped down for the younger generation and gathered there.\nBefore Seon-ah could answer, Eldest Brother interjected.\n\"Hmm. The Sacred Order and Law Enforcement Hall also leave the cult from time to time.\"\nIt was an unusually sharp observation from Eldest Brother.\n'Guess he's not completely clueless.'\nEldest Brother was right.\nIf the person they were guarding had to leave the cult, the guards would naturally accompany them, just as Jang Hwi and Kwan Mu-yeol had traveled around Xinjiang with me.\nAnd the Law Enforcement Hall often pursued fugitives beyond the headquarters.\nWell, Eldest Brother probably had another reason for pointing that out.\n'Kids these days! They just try to avoid hard work! Back in my day~' Newest update provıded by novęlfire.net\nThat kind of vibe was radiating off Eldest Brother as he looked at Seon-ah.\nI had thought only Master was old-fashioned, but Eldest Brother was quite the old fogey too.\nWell, generational disdain was a time-honored tradition.\nComplaints about the younger generation were as old as time itself.\nTo everyone's surprise, Seon-ah reacted to Eldest Brother’s comment with bright, sparkling eyes.\n\"I want to join the Sacred Order!\"\n\"The Sacred Order also has to go outside a lot!\"\n\"That's okay! If I can go with Big Brother.\"\nShe said this while looking at me with bright, sparkling eyes.\n\"Ehahahaha! So, she doesn't hate leaving the cult; she hates being away from our youngest! Khahahaha!\"\nEldest Brother laughed heartily, having finally realized Seon-ah's true feelings.\nEmbarrassed by his blunt statement, Seon-ah clung to me tighter.\nAs I stroked the cute little one's head, I glanced to the side.\nKwan Mu-yeol was there, staring blankly into space, as if our commotion had nothing to do with him. Then, I pictured Jang Hwi, the other pair of our human doorbell at Windrock Palace's entrance.\nIt hit me then.\n'Maybe it would be better to have Seon-ah as my guard rather than being stuck with these gloomy men.'\nAbove all, Seon-ah gave me the definite feeling of being on my side, so I thought I could truly relax with her around.\nDays blurred into weeks, then months.\nOver half a year had passed since Il-mok was dragged to this house of madmen called the Demonic Cult, and Il-mok finally managed to complete not only the scriptures and historical texts but also the law books.\nOf course, it's impossible for anyone but a genius to memorize everything perfectly after reading it once. Consistent review is necessary until the entrance examination.\nAnyway, Il-mok felt the need to tweak his daily routine a bit.\nHe reduced his morning study time a bit and increased his training time.\nWhile still concerned about the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's side effect, Il-mok had realized something simple yet crucial—the severity of the side effects was directly proportional to the level of his mastery.\nIn other words.\n'As long as my level doesn't increase rapidly, the possibility of the side effect running wild is low.'\nIl-mok had strongly experienced side effects twice: when he first used his internal energy and when he absorbed the Explosive Demonic Pill and received the Bone Marrow Cleansing.\nBoth times, his skill level rose explosively.\nAs long as his skill level wasn't increasing too drastically, the risk of going crazy from side effects or Qi Deviation was low.\nOn the other hand, slow growth meant the side effect would creep in without him noticing.\nBut despite knowing this fact, Il-mok chose to raise his level slowly for now.\nEntering the Hall of the Demonic Way and getting revenge on Uncle Taehyun. To succeed at least at those two things, it was something he had to do.\nAnd so, after finishing his daily routine as usual, Il-mok went to bed.\nHow much time had passed?\nOnce a month, the moon would hide itself in the darkness, signifying the new cycle of the moon.\nTaking advantage of the particularly dark sky, a shadowy figure cautiously slipped into Windrock Palace.\nThat presence, devoid of any human presence, moved silently towards Il-mok's quarters like a shadow.\nWhish.\nUnder the cover of the night breeze, that presence stealthily opened the door and slipped inside.\nAnd what greeted the intruder was the sight of Il-mok calmly rising from bed.\n\"Yaaaawn. Third Brother. You're here?\"\nIl-mok stretched languidly as he greeted him.\nThird Brother, who had left for a Dark Shadow Pavilion mission a few days ago, was returning today.\nSo, just in case, Il-mok had tied a thin thread to the door and looped it around his wrist.\nThat way, if the door opened even a crack, he'd feel the vibration on his arm.\nThanks to his experience of being startled by Third Brother’s nocturnal visits several times before, he'd devised this plan to wake up calmly.\nWaking up in a panic disrupted his sleep, which then disrupted his daily routine the next day. In a way, it was a desperate measure born of necessity due to his obsessive-compulsive tendencies.\nBut for some reason, despite Il-mok's greeting, the shadow showed no response.\nIt just stood there, looking down at Il-mok for a moment as if contemplating something.\nThe shadow that had seemed to be pondering finally moved.\nPop!\n\"!!!\"\nThe shadow closed the distance in a flash, pulling a blackened sword that didn’t reflect any light from its hip.\nIl-mok instinctively rolled his body, narrowly avoiding the first strike.\nSlash!\nOr not. He thought he’d dodged, but he felt a sting on his forearm.\n'Motherfucker. Has he finally gone mad?'\nThe thought barely registered before he drew his own sword.\nRolling away just now wasn't just to dodge the surprise attack, but more so to grab the sword by his bedside.\nAnd faster than Il-mok could draw his sword, the crazed senior brother swung a second killing blow at him.\nDespite the charcoal coating making its trajectory barely visible, Il-mok's eyes were faintly able to read the sword's path.\nClang!!\nWith a sword he hadn't fully drawn, he managed to block that killing sword just in time.\nCreak.\nSlash.\nHowever, even while circulating his internal energy to the maximum, his sword snapped in two after just a brief clash.\nAnd as the crazed assassin who had cut Il-mok's sword lunged forward.\nIl-mok realized something crucial.\n'This guy. He's not Third Brother.'",

    "content": "Chapter 41: Assassination (3)\nDuring the first attack, I was too disoriented to get a good look. But as I fended off the second attack, I recognized the subtle differences from Third Brother's Demonic Art.\nI could tell because I had engaged in dozens of sparring matches with Third Brother, and he'd even shown me the Shadowless Fourteen Moves a few times for demonstration.\nSo, this isn’t Third Brother going berserk. This was a real assassin who had come to kill me.\n'Why me?'\nSuch a question did cross my mind, but this wasn't the time to dwell on it.\nSurvival was the priority now.\nSlash!\nI retreated as the assailant lunged, but I was a step too slow again, receiving a shallow cut across my chest. And now I had nowhere left to retreat.\n'Damn it.'\nThe second my back hit the wall, the assassin was on me, swinging for the kill. I abandoned my broken sword and flung it at him with my right hand.\nAs he sidestepped the projectile, I swung my left hand, channeling my internal energy into it and—\nSwish!\nThe remaining half of the blade that I hadn't drawn, still in its scabbard, flew toward the assassin like a hidden weapon.\nClang!\nCaught off guard, the assassin deflected it with his sword.\nWhoosh!\nSeizing that moment, I used my lightness technique to its fullest and launched myself sideways by using the wall.\nSlash!\nRight after I jumped away, the wall behind me exploded into debris. Capitalizing on that brief moment, I retaliated by thrusting my right hand toward the assassin’s back in a stabbing motion.\nScabbard in hand, I unleashed the Soul-Cutting Flash.\nThe lack of a proper grip made it awkward, but survival instinct fueled a perfect strike.\nSurprised by the unorthodox attack—or perhaps by the degree of my skill—the assassin abandoned his technique for a desperate Lazy Donkey Roll.\nAs expected from an assassin, he didn’t hesitate to abandon his pride and prioritize his survival.\nBut making him roll on the floor wouldn't be enough for me.\nShrieeeek!\nI swung the scabbard again and again at the guy rolling on the ground. However, as soon as he finished rolling and got back on his feet, he swung his sword right back at my scabbard.\nSlash! Slash!\nWith each clash of his sword and my scabbard, bits of the scabbard were sliced away.\nIt was a dire sight as by the time the assassin had fully regained his stance, the scabbard had been reduced to half its length.\nAnticipating his next movement, I threw the remaining fragment of scabbard at him.\nSlash!\nAnd even that last-ditch effort was cut down effortlessly.\n\"Phew.\"\nBut I breathed a sigh of relief.\n\"Young Master!!\"\n\"Did Third Young Master sneak in again!?\"\nJin Hayeon and the two guards stationed nearby had reached my quarters. Though the fight felt like an eternity due to my life being at stake, it all actually happened within the span of just a few seconds.\n\"It's not Third Brother!\"\n\"!!!\"\nKwan Mu-yeol immediately crashed into the room.\nCrash!\nThe assassin immediately bolted to the window, abandoning his mission.\nCrunch!\n\"I'll chase him!\"\nSimultaneously, I heard a sickening thud, like something being pierced, followed by Jang Hwi’s shout. Looks like Jang Hwi had anticipated the escape and was already at the window.\nRight after the assassin escaped.\n\"Whew.\"\nI gulped air, trying to calm my racing heart. It was just a few seconds of dodging and swinging a scabbard—nothing compared to my usual training regimen—yet my heart pounded and sweat drenched my body.\n\"Are you alright, Young Master?\"\nJin Hayeon immediately tore pieces of her clothes and started tending my wounds. She applied ointment to the wounded areas and then wrapped them with pieces of her clothes.\nOnly then did I snap back to reality, and my face instantly crumpled.\nIt wasn’t because the pain finally registered in my brain.\n'Damn it.'\nThe room had become a complete mess. Not only am I now sleep-deprived, but my schedule for tomorrow was bound to be messed up.\nIt’s funny that just a moment ago I nearly died, yet these trivial matters kept buzzing around my brain.\nBut the real reason why my face crumpled wasn’t because of the messed-up schedule or the ruined room.\n“Jin Hayeon.”\n\"Yes, Young Master.\"\n“Get me a sword.”\n\"A sword?\" She asked, confusion painted her usually stoic face.\nHer uncharacteristic confusion drew a deeper sigh from me.\n“I need to train.”\nThe flawless sword movements from that life-or-death fight with the assassin kept replaying in my head.\nI felt like I would go mad if I didn't make them mine right now.\n'So much for being so cautious.'\nThe damned bastard had inadvertently pushed my Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword to new depths.\nBy the time dawn tinged the sky with a golden hue, the entire cult was in an uproar.\nJang Hwi reported that he had successfully pursued the wounded assassin, but unfortunately, the assassin committed suicide.\nOf course, suicide doesn’t erase all traces. A full-scale investigation was launched, starting with the assassin's body.\nAround noon—much earlier than usual—Master arrived at Windrock Palace.\n\"How are you feeling?\"\n\"The injuries weren't that serious, Master.\"\nMaster nodded at my answer but maintained a grave expression.\n\"I came to check on you and to share what we've learned so far.\"\nHe began explaining the findings.\n\"The assassin was a Dark Shadow Pavilion operative named Chugak. Based on our investigation of his activities and background, there's a high probability that he was a spy planted by the Murim Alliance.\"\n\"The Murim Alliance?\"\n\"That's right. We're currently investigating anyone who had even the slightest connection to him, trying to uncover if there are any other spies.\"\nAlliance’s spies within the Demonic Cult were nothing new. The reverse is also true that the Demonic Cult also planted spies within the Alliance, that’s how we identify those who are responsible for Uncle Tae-hyun’s death.\nBut there is one thing that baffled me.\n\"Why would the Murim Alliance target me of all people?\"\nI might be the disciple of the Heavenly Demon, but I was just a novice who had joined the cult barely half a year ago. If they were targeting people just because they were Master's disciples, it would make more sense to go after my senior brothers, not me.\n\"There are two main reasons I can think of.\"\n\"Not just one, but two?\"\n\"Indeed. First, it's about the school program. The schools you proposed are already operating throughout Xinjiang, and it's widely known within the cult that you were the one who conceived the idea. You’re shaping the Cult’s future. To those fearing our growth, eliminating a weak visionary now would be a wise move.”\nNipping the bud before it could bloom.\nI had not considered the school program as something special, but perhaps others saw it as a revolutionary change.\nWhile I pondered this, Master explained the second reason.\n\"The other reason is that your existence is an obstacle to the Murim Alliance's propaganda.\"\n\"Because of what you mentioned before?\"\nMaster nodded.\nHe meant the inn incident—the Murim Alliance had killed Uncle Taehyun and framed Master, even spreading tales of my death. Yet here I am, not only alive but also a disciple of the Heavenly Demon.\nOf course, they could spin the narrative to cover their mistake, but my survival was undeniably inconvenient for them.\n'So since I'm already a nuisance, they thought they might as well kill me.'\nWhat a fucked up situation.\nI thought I was the one who marked them as prey, but it turned out the Murim Alliance was doing the same to me.\nShortly after Master left, Windrock Palace's doors burst open. For origınal chapters go to novel fire.net\n\"Big Brother!!\"\nSeon-ah, her face pale with fear, rushed in and fell flat on the floor. But as if that didn't matter, she quickly scrambled up, ignoring her scraped knees and elbows, and clung to me.\nI was the one who had almost died, yet she was the one who looked like a drowning cat.\nIt was a strange feeling to have someone who cherished me this much, even though it was partly due to the influence of her Demonic Art..\n\"W-who did this to you? How dare they target Big Brother! I-I'll kill them all!\"\n\"...\"\nHer way of showing concern was a bit concerning.\nCome to think of it, her eyes and hair seemed redder than before.\nFeeling a little worried about the kid's condition, I stroked Seon-ah's hair and said.\n\"It's okay. He's already dead. You don't need to kill anyone. You did well rushing to help as soon as you could.”\nI meant it as praise, but Seon-ah's eyes grew even redder.\n\"Everyone was hiding from me that Oppa was in danger. When I get back, I'm not gonna let them off the hook.\"\n\"...\"\nWas the Hyeokryeon Family about to get blown to bits?\nWell, none of my business, so I just decided to keep my mouth shut.\nMeanwhile, more visitors arrived.\n\"Youngest! Are you alright?\"\nLike Seon-ah, Eldest Brother barged in with a distressed face. But he, lacking the cuteness factor that Seon-ah had made him look like a raging boar rather than a concerned brother.\n\"I'll submit a formal complaint to Master and the Sacred Order! How dare a mere Alliance spy try to kill my precious brother?! This is outrageous!”\n\"That's right!!\"\nAs Seon-ah chimed in agreement with Eldest Brother, the two were suddenly on the same page.\n\"Our youngest is a talent who will lead the cult to greatness alongside this Wi Jin-hak! For such a talent to nearly die so easily! This won't do. I will make sure to increase your guards!”\n\"I'll protect Big Brother too!\"\nIn contrast, Third Brother, who had come with Eldest Brother, had a completely dejected look.\n\"I'm sorry I couldn't help. This useless brother was too busy controlling his Qi deviation to realize you were in danger.\"\n\"Don't say that Third Brother. If it weren't for you, I would have been as good as dead.\"\nThird Brother's frequent night raids had served as practice drills. If I hadn't been preparing for them, I probably would've gone straight to the afterlife without even waking up from dreamland.\nHonestly, I was annoyed every time he showed up in the middle of the night and scared the crap out of me, but it had actually turned out to be a blessing in disguise.\nBut seeing his continued gloom, I asked, \"You experienced Qi deviation?\"\nThird Brother nodded slightly at my question.\nIt felt weirdly coincidental.\n‘I wondered if seeing the assassin triggered his episode… but he was already unstable.’\nIf he'd attacked alongside the assassin, things would have gotten truly messy.\n\"Hmm?\"\nAs my thoughts reached that point, a question spontaneously left my lips.\nThe people around me looked at me with puzzled expressions, but I was too focused on the thought that had suddenly occurred to me to pay attention to them.\nIt was something I'd normally dismiss, but for some reason, I couldn't let it go. After considering various possibilities, I reached one conclusion.\n‘Maybe, just maybe, that assassin wasn’t sent by the Murim Alliance.’",

    "content": "Chapter 42: Assassination (4)\nDespite the hasty cleaning effort since the morning, the sword marks from the assassination attempt still decorated the walls in my room.\nOnly Eldest Brother, Third Brother, and I remained. Everyone else had been dismissed.\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\"Is there a problem?\" Eldest Brother asked gravely, likely noting my solemn expression.\n\"What I'm about to tell you is just a possibility, not a certainty,\" I began.\nWith that, I shared the theory I had just formulated.\n\"Currently, the man called Chu-gak is known to be a spy from the Murim Alliance, but he might actually be an assassin sent to target me from within the Divine Cult.\"\n\"!!\"\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\"First, let me recount the assassination attempt. I survived it thanks to Third Brother. His frequent late-night visits had led me to prepare a way to detect intrusions into my quarters.\"\n\"So that's why you said it was thanks to me.\"\nThird Brother nodded grimly, finally connecting the dots.\n\"Yes, this was a secret I kept to myself. Since both the two guards and Miss Jin disapproved of Third Brother's late-night visits, it was a measure I quietly prepared to avoid startling them.”\n“I… hadn’t realized you went to such lengths.”\n\"Anyway, the point is, I survived because I had taken those precautions. Otherwise, I would have died without even realizing an assassin was there.\" ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ novel_fіre.net\n\"Hahaha! Indeed, Third Brother practically saved your life!\"\nEldest Brother's praise brightened Third Brother's gloomy mood, but I pressed on.\n\"The important thing here is what if I hadn't been prepared? What if I had just died without making a sound?\"\n\"If you'd died?\"\n\"Yes. If that happened, who would be the first person to come under suspicion?\"\nEldest Brother and I both turned to Third Brother, whose face instantly paled at the implication.\n“Had I died silently, my body would’ve been discovered by Miss Jin or the guards in the morning. Considering they are aware of Third Brother’s occasional night visits, what do you think would happen?”\n\"But I was in my quarters at that time, wrestling with Qi Deviation.\"\nThird Brother weakly objected, feeling wronged.\n\"That's precisely the problem. Consider this, Brother. If I had lost my life that night, and at the moment of my death, you were experiencing Qi Deviation. If, amidst these circumstances, a bloodstained sword or something of that nature were discovered in your room, what would they conclude?\"\n“They’d assume I killed you unknowingly under the influence of Qi Deviation.”\nA shared gloom settled over them. After a moment, as if just remembering something, Eldest Brother asked in puzzlement.\n\"But why would a blood-stained sword suddenly appear in Third Brother's room?\"\n\"For my theory to work, those targeting me would need to know where and when Third Brother fell into Qi Deviation last night. Meaning, someone close to Third Brother leaked that information.\"\n\"!!!\"\n\"If such a person exists, receiving the sword after my assassination and secretly placing it in Third Brother's room during his Qi Deviation would be a simple matter.\"\nOf course, there was a logical leap here, one they hadn't noticed in their shock.\nWould the assassins really stake their plan on Third Brother's unpredictable Qi Deviation? Even if they intended to portray him as the culprit using his Qi Deviation, how could they possibly know exactly when to strike, assassinate me, and plant evidence before his episode concluded?\nEven if they were to convict him solely on circumstantial evidence, the level of preparation, timing, and precision required for this act seems improbable.\nUnless...\n'They had a way to induce or control the timing of Qi Deviation.’\nI didn't know if such a thing existed, but...\n“If this theory is correct, it means a mole exists among those aware of Third Brother's nighttime activities—likely someone close to him.\"\nJin Hayeon, Kwan Mu-yeol, and Jang Hwi.\nAt least one of these three was the assassin’s accomplice.\n\"We must report this to Master immediately!\"\nEldest Brother sprang to his feet, murderous intent radiating from him like a heat haze.\nI quickly stopped him.\n\"Didn't I tell you this is just a possibility? And with the evidence pointing towards the Murim Alliance, the odds of this theory being correct are slim. Besides, we have no direct proof.\"\n\"Proof? We'll get proof if we interrogate those three!\"\n\"......\"\nHonestly, even I, who came up with this theory, wasn't entirely convinced. It was just a compulsive thought that my obsessive mind couldn't let go of.\nFurthermore, the idea of torturing people with whom I had been close was not something I was comfortable with.\n\"The odds are this theory is wrong,\" I said carefully.\n\"Furthermore, if we report to Master without identifying the mastermind, they might go into hiding. We need to proceed cautiously. This concerns not just me, but you as well, Eldest Brother.\"\n\"???\"\nSeeing his bewildered expression, I explained.\n\"Assuming this incident isn't actually the Murim Alliance's work, but a deliberate scheme to frame Third Brother, then why would they target me with such an elaborate scheme?\"\n“Because I saw you as an ally?”\nI nodded.\nTry as I might, that was the only reason I could find.\nTo be precise,\n\"They likely see us as obstacles to becoming the next Heavenly Demon.\"\nSomeone was trying to eliminate the Heavenly Demon’s disciples to secure the position for themselves.\nAs understanding hit him, Eldest Brother's face darkened with fury he could barely contain.\n\"For people calling themselves members of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult to resort to such underhanded tactics!!\"\nHis anger stemmed from the fact that they had chosen vile methods rather than fair competition.\nHowever, even as his eyes glinted red from suppressed anger, he didn’t erupt like the last time and maintained his sanity.\nHe truly had achieved Transcendence in his Demonic Art.\nAnd then he turned that murderous face towards me, asking through gritted teeth.\n“Do you have a plan, youngest?”\nMeeting his terrifying aura head-on, I replied calmly.\n\"Again, this is just a theory based on a slim possibility. But I do have a plan, just in case.\"\nThat night, somewhere within the Demonic Cult.\nThe Divine Guardian and three men met in secret.\n\"Tch. For someone from the Dark Shadow Pavilion, to not even be able to handle a newbie who's only been in the Cult for half a year. Trash.\"\nIn response to the man on the right, the Divine Guardian reassured.\n\"At least we successfully diverted suspicion to the Murim Alliance. Our preparations paid off.\"\nThe plan to frame the Third Young Master had been devised long ago, using intelligence gathered by moles planted near Il-mok. However, its execution had been delayed for some time due to the need to prepare for the worst-case scenario. In the event of the assassin's failure, they needed time to create fake evidence to shift the blame to the Murim Alliance.\nYet the man on the right remained uneasy, eyeing the central figure.\n\"But is it truly safe? What if they find out about what we used on Third Young Master?\"\nThe central figure clicked his tongue dismissively.\n\"Don't worry. It leaves absolutely no trace after use.\"\nIrritated by the whining, the central figure turned to the Divine Guardian.\n\"This incident means the guards will be replaced, and we will lose our operative.\"\n\"We simply need to prepare another operative, so do not concern yourself. More importantly, what are your plans now?\"\nThe central figure stroked his beard briefly before answering.\n\"Using what you mentioned back then might not be a bad idea. Didn't you say the Eighth Young Master has been suffering from side effects of his Demonic Art recently?\"\nThe fact that Il-mok had consulted his bodyguard about how to deal with the side effects had also already reached these guys.\n“By making his death look like a Qi Deviation, just like we did with the Fifth Young Master?”\nThe central figure nodded.\nWhile this technique was limited to certain Demonic Art side effects, they possessed the ability to induce Qi Deviation by exploiting those very side effects, just as they had with the Third Young Master.\nThe next morning, Master visited Windrock Palace again.\n\"The Heavenly Demon Descends! Ten Thousand Demons Obeys!\"\n\"We greet the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons!\"\nMaster accepted their greeting and commanded them.\n\"I have something to discuss with Il-mok, so leave us.\"\n\"As you command!\"\nOnce alone, he eyed the sword in my hand.\n\"You might reopen your wounds if you push yourself too hard.\"\n\"It's just a shallow cut, nothing serious. Perhaps because I'm still young, I seem to heal quickly. Hahaha.\"\n\"You speak as if you've experienced getting old.\"\n\"Ahem. It's something I often heard from Uncle Taehyun. He complained about waking up sore even after a full night's sleep.\"\nAlmost let slip that I'd transmigrated there for a second.\nLuckily, Master didn't seem to find my words suspicious and moved on to the main point.\n\"We investigated Chu-gak's connections. The Dark Shadow Pavilion Leader was scrutinized first, but nothing suspicious was found. We are now looking into his associates, but the evidence suggests he acted alone.\"\nHis tone mirrored the Eldest Brother’s simmering rage.\nIt seemed he was quite furious that a Murim Alliance spy had infiltrated and even targeted his youngest disciple.\n\"Also, I plan to replace your guards and attendant. Now that your studies are complete, Miss Jin's lessons are no longer required. I'll assign more experienced guards.\"\nHe was concerned for my safety. Dismissing them was likely to discuss this.\nAnd this was the conversation I had been waiting for.\n\"If my safety is the concern, wouldn't it be enough to just increase the number of guards? Is there a need to dismiss them?\"\n\"I understand you've become attached to them during your time together. But their failure cannot be ignored.\"\n\"But I'm perfectly fine, aren't I?\"\n\"The fact that an assassin reached your room is a failure in itself.\"\n\"I'm alive. It wasn't a complete failure. Please just assign additional personnel.\"\n\"Why are you going so far to defend them?\"\nI adopted the most cringe-worthy sorrowful expression that I could muster without dying.\n\"If they're punished because of this incident, won't their future lives in the cult be difficult? How could they rise higher while branded as failures?\"\nMaster observed my near-tearful performance while stroking his beard.\n\"How noble. Your concern for your fellow believers is commendable.”\n\"Thank you, Master!\"\n\"But only this once. You are my disciple, the future of the cult. Your life is no longer your own. Protecting those who failed their duty out of sentimentality could lead to greater problems.\"\n\"I understand! I'll keep that in mind!\"\nI prostrated myself on the floor, showing Master the utmost respect.\nThis was how cultists normally behaved toward the Heavenly Demon.\nAnd, it wasn't like I was really begging Master because I felt sorry for those three.\n'First step complete.'\nAlthough the possibility was low, if my theory was correct, at least one of those three was a suspected enemy mole.\nAnd as a famous movie quote said, keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.\nThe first step to my plan was to set myself as bait.\nThe fish seemed in no hurry to take the bait, as nothing noteworthy happened that day.\nAnd that night.\nShortly after Il-mok retired to his room.\nKnock, knock.\n\"Young Master, are you asleep?\"\nJin Hayeon's voice came from beyond the door.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"May I come in?\"\nAt this hour? Why?\nThough suspicion arose in his mind, Il-mok told her to enter.\nThe moment Jin Hayeon stepped into the room, Il-mok’s mind short-circuited.\n\"Wh-why did you bring all that stuff with you?\"\nShe was wearing what seemed to be her nightwear with a blanket and pillow clutched in her arms.\nThe problem was, why did she bring all that?\n\"I heard from the Heavenly Demon that you forgave my lapse in duty.\"\nCould it be that she's trying to repay the favor in that way?\n\"I, I didn't tell Master that with that intention in mind.\"\nHer response, however, defied expectations.\n\"Since you granted me mercy, I must prove my renewed dedication. I believe my tardiness stemmed from being too far from you. Therefore, from now on, I will stay in your quarters and be by your side constantly.\"\n\"So, you're saying you'll sleep here for protection?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Every day?\"\n\"Protecting you allows for no rest days.\"\n\"......\"\nJin Hayeon answered with that same cold expression he saw every day.\nAfter considering briefly, Il-mok nodded.\n\"Do as you wish.\"\nDefinitely not because he had any ulterior motives.\n'Right. Jin Hayeon is also a suspect. Since I'm the bait, something might turn up if she's close by.'\nIl-mok told himself.\nBut why was his heart beating faster?",

    "content": "Chapter 43: History is Made at Night (1)\nThey say most of the world's pleasures unfold at night.\nBut on this supposedly serene night—\n'I can't sleep!'\nI was lying awake, staring into the darkness.\nThe reason was simple.\nBeside me lay a woman whose beauty was breathtaking, almost unsettling.\n'No. It's not because she is beautiful!'\nThough it was well past bedtime, I shook my head, determined to keep myself awake.\n‘Jin Hayeon could be a mole. The moment I fall asleep, she might stab my heart with that emotionless face of hers!'\nYes, it must be anxiety.\nBetween the lingering effects of my Demonic Arts and the ever-present threat of assassination, restful sleep was a distant luxury.\n'That's why my heart is pounding so hard. Yeah, that's it.'\nI tossed and turned, trying to convince myself, but—\nGlance.\nI couldn't resist sneaking a peek at Jin Hayeon's sleeping face.\n'Wow… How can a person be this beautiful?'\nDuring the day, her psychopathic tendencies usually squashed any buds of feeling that might have sprouted. But here at night, I couldn’t help but be mesmerized by her delicate features.\nAnd while I was absentmindedly admiring this doll bathed in moonlight.\nFlinch.\nThe doll suddenly opened its eyes.\n\"Eep!?\"\nA strange and strangled scream escaped my mouth, reminding me of a child caught red-handed while doing something wrong.\nUnfazed by my reaction, Jin Hayeon spoke in her characteristically emotionless tone.\n“Are you unable to sleep, Young Master?”\n“Ahem. I-I’m usually a light sleeper. Being in unfamiliar surroundings makes it a little hard for me to fall asleep.”\nA lie involuntarily escaped my mouth. But Jin Hayeon furrowed her delicate eyebrows.\n\"Yet you slept soundly during your latest trip.\"\nThis is why sharp-witted children are exhausting.\nWas it because fatigue was suddenly washing over me? Or was it because of her characteristically emotionless tone?\nMy heart, which had been racing since bedtime, rapidly calmed down.\n\"Ahem. I'm suddenly feeling sleepy. Rest well, Miss Jin.\"\n\"I'm already quite comfortable.\"\n\"I... I see.\"\nCompletely drained, I fell into a deep sleep.\n\"Yaaawn.\"\nSince I went to bed much later than usual, I wasn’t refreshed at all—instead, fatigue hit me the moment I opened my eyes. Thıs content belongs to Nove1Fire.net\nRubbing my stiff neck, I glanced sideways—only to find Jin Hayeon’s bedding already neatly folded.\n\"I've brought breakfast, Young Master.\"\nShe opened the door and entered, carrying a tray laden with food.\n'This feels exactly like we're married.'\nHorrified by the thought, I shook my head vigorously to dismiss it.\nRight. That face is a trap.\nThe moment I fall for that face, a suffocating future would unfold day by day.\nMunch, munch .\nI shovelled the breakfast she’d prepared into my mouth so mechanically that, in my exhaustion, I barely registered the taste.\nJust as I finished, Jin Hayeon broke the silence.\n\"Since you woke up an hour later than usual, we'll begin morning studies immediately, Young Master.\"\n\"......\"\nIndeed, she truly had a knack for making me breathless.\nMorning studies and lunch passed as usual. Then, visitors began trickling in, but the atmosphere felt empty compared to usual.\n\"Big Brother!\"\nSeon-ah, as usual, stuck close to me, rubbing her chubby cheeks and grinning broadly. But other than her, almost no one else came.\nNeither Eldest Brother nor Hang Geon appeared, nor did Sixth Brother, who suffered from auditory and visual hallucinations.\nAs far as I knew, Third Brother was away on a mission.\nOnly Ouyang Mun, recently returned from his own mission, was present.\n\"Hahahaha! It's rather quiet today, Young Master!\"\nMeaning he was just chattering to himself.\nHow long had I been absentmindedly playing with cute Seon-ah's hair, tuning out Ouyang Mun's endless nonsense?\n'It's peaceful so far.'\nNeither Jin Hayeon nor the bodyguards had made any suspicious moves.\n\"Yawn. Ah, sorry, Young Warrior Gu.”\nYawning while someone was speaking was considered rude, so I quickly apologized.\n\"Haha. It's fine, Young Master! You seem quite tired.\"\n\"I didn't sleep well last night.\"\n\"Well, after what happened recently, it’s no wonder you couldn’t sleep.\"\n\"It wasn’t entirely because of that either.”\nSince there were others involved in that assassination attempt around us, I tried to change the subject subtly.\nOuyang Mun, however, seemed to misunderstand that hint, subtly eyeing Jin Hayeon as he did so.\n\"I heard you spoke to the Heavenly Demon on Hayeon's behalf. As a fellow graduate from the Hall of the Demonic Way, I thank you on her behalf. Hahaha!\"\nI'd said to show kindness, not flaunt their non-existent camaraderie. But he seemed to have misunderstood my advice in a strange way.\n“Why are you thanking the Young Master on my behalf when you are merely a comrade?”\nBoth my ears and Seol-ah’s perked up at the prospect of an impending one-sided love quarrel.\nIt couldn’t be helped—it was the only entertainment available here.\nBut little did I expect this entertainment to return as a bomb.\n\"Ahem. Still, as a comrade, that much is expected, isn't it?\"\n\"Mind your own business. Even without your interference, I have been reflecting on my own. That’s why I’ve been sleeping in the same room as the Young Master.”\n\"!?\"\nThe moment Jin Hayeon dropped the bomb, Ouyang Mun's eyes bulged and his jaw dropped as he looked back and forth between me and her.\nThe little kid by my side also looked back and forth between me and Jin Hayeon, but her reaction was entirely different.\n“Hmph. I want to play with Big Brother at night too.”\nShe pouted enviously.\nAnd that pitiful soul on the other hand—\n\"W-w-what are you saying?\"\nOuyang Mun, who had momentarily short-circuited, was now on the verge of a meltdown.\nUnlike the little one, whose thoughts remained pure, Ouyang Mun’s imagination not only took things a step further but also ran wild.\n\"Now that I think about it, the Young Master mentioned being t-tired earlier... D-don't tell me!?\"\nThe more he spoke, the more Jin Hayeon’s gaze turned into one of utter disgust, as if she were looking at an insect.\nYet, already too far gone, he failed to recognize her disdain.\n\"How could you do this to me, Master!\"\n\"Ahem. Get a hold of yourself, you fool. And why am I your master?\"\n\"Didn’t you say you’d accept me as your disciple back then? Don't tell me all the advice you gave me was a lie!?\"\nIf I left him like this, his already doomed love life would be beyond salvation.\nNo, they already seemed to have crossed the river of the afterlife, but I felt I should at least let them remain as comrade.\n\"Snap out of it. We shared a room purely for security reasons. Nothing happened.\"\n\"Is, is that true?\"\n\"It is.\"\nI met Ouyang Mun’s doubtful gaze with a look that lacked any ounce of shame.\nDid my unwavering gaze do the trick? Ouyang Mun’s shaky gaze slowly became steady.\nThen, after a brief moment of contemplation, Ouyang Mun suddenly spoke in a voice brimming with resolve.\n\"Master.\"\n\"Speak.\"\n\"Please accept me as your guard.\"\n“What kind of dogshi—no, what nonsense are you spouting? You are part of the White Tortoise Corps.”\n\"If you allow it, I’ll submit my resignation immediately. If I become your personal guard, then Hayeon won’t have to sleep in the same room as you anymore, right?\"\nWhile his suspicion had disappeared, what replaced it was a burning madness.\nJust as I thought, this guy was a true lunatic, befitting his status as an elite member of this damned cult.\n‘I thought his side effect was mania, but now I see—it’s obsession.’\nBut his diagnosis was irrelevant now.\n\"Is changing allegiances within the cult so easy that you make light of it? Come to your senses and focus on your own duties.\"\nSharing a room with a stalker-like crazy man? Absolutely not.\nPerhaps because I shut him down so decisively—\nGrab.\nThis lunatic actually dropped to his knees and clung to my leg, refusing to let go.\n\"P-please, Master! You can work me to the bone if you want—just let me be your personal guard!\"\nLooking at that desperate figure, I couldn’t help but think.\n'What a pathetic man.'\nThey say love might conquer pride, but this was just sad.\nAfter belatedly realizing Jin Hayeon’s disgusted glare, Ouyang Mun bolted out of the Windrock Palace in shame.\nTime passed, and once the break ended, Il-mok spent his time as usual—either sparring with Jin Hayeon or training under his Master.\nLater that evening.\n\"Today's training was pretty intense. I'm feeling hungry.\" Il-mok muttered, rubbing his stomach.\n\"I'll bring some late-night snacks from the kitchen.\"\nAs Jin Hayeon was about to leave, Kwan Mu‑yeol—who was standing guard at one corner of Windrock Palace—interjected.\n\"Continue the acupuncture, Miss Jin. I'll go.\"\n\"It’s fine, Warrior Kwan.\"\nWhen Jin Hayeon refused, Kwan Mu-yeol replied with a serious tone.\n\"I insist. Even if I'm away, Jang Hwi will be here, and don't you have many tasks to attend to, Miss Jin?\"\nIn the end, Jin Hayeon relented to Kwan Mu-yeol's insistence.\n\"Then I'll leave it to you.\"\nAs soon as Jin Hayeon finished speaking, Kwan Mu-yeol left Windrock Palace, and she resumed massaging Il-mok's body.\nFeeling the chilliness transmitted through Jin Ha-yeon’s hands, Il-mok thought.\n'What's this? Since when did he care about her?'\nUntil now, neither Kwan Mu-yeol nor Jang Hwi had ever stepped forward to help Jin Hayeon in her various duties.\nYet today—perhaps because of Ouyang Mun’s outrageous antics—Il-mok found it oddly intriguing to see Kwan Mu‑yeol suddenly showing Jin Hayeon some favor.\n'Hmm. This could become an interesting spectacle.'\nThe first image that came to Il-mok's mind was of Kwan Mu-yeol and Ouyang Mun fighting over Jin Hayeon in a love triangle.\nAnd knowing Jin Hayeon, she would undoubtedly look at him as though he were nothing more than an insect.\nMeanwhile.\nKwan Mu-yeol, who had become the unwitting victim of Il-mok's strange imagination, had quickly reached the kitchen.\n\"What can I prepare for you?\"\n“Just some simple snacks to go with the Dragon Well Tea will do.”\nKwan Mu-yeol replied curtly to the woman on duty.\nShe poured hot water from the simmering stove, brewed the tea, and then placed a few of the midnight snack pastries that had been prepared in advance on a plate and served them.\nKwan Mu-yeol placed them on a tray and prepared to leave.\n\"Won't you stay and enjoy it yourself?\"\n\"I'm here on an errand.\"\nThe woman nodded at his explanation and didn’t ask any further questions.\n\"Take care.\"\nKwan Mu-yeol nodded and left the kitchen. But instead of heading straight to Windrock Palace, he slipped into a darkened side path.\nAfter ensuring that no one was tailing him, he breathed a sigh of relief. Then he reached into his garment and pulled out a small leather pouch.\nRustle.\nUpon untying the string that bound the leather pouch, inside lay a vividly patterned mushroom that looked much like a poisonous toadstool.\nKwan Mu-yeol then pinched off the edge of the mushroom with his fingers, channeled his internal energy to turn it into powder, and mixed it into the Dragon Well Tea.",

    "content": "Chapter 44: History is Made at Night (2)\nJust like someone at peak concentration, Kwan Mu-yeol's pupils were constricted, his gaze fixed on the finely ground powder falling from his fingers into the Dragon Well tea.\nAnd just before all the powder is mixed into the tea—\nPat.\nA finger shot out from the darkness, aiming for Kwon Mu-yeol's pressure point.\n\"!?\"\nKwon Mu-yeol noticed the ambush too late and tried to swat away the approaching fingers, but was a beat too late.\nHaving focused on poisoning the Dragon Well Tea, he had noticed the hidden enemy's approach far too late.\nPa-pat!\nWith lightning speed, the black-clothed figure struck two pressure points on Kwan Mu-yeol’s body and instantly immobilized him.\nWith the same speed and grace, the black-clothed figure also caught the pouch containing the poisonous mushroom and the Dragon Well Tea from mid-air.\nSecuring the items, he hoisted the incapacitated Kwan Mu-yeol over his shoulder and melted into the darkness, disappearing somewhere into the night.\n\"Ughhhh.\"\nIl-mok, on the other hand, was still enjoying the relaxing massage from Jin Hayeon. A strange groan had just escaped his mouth when suddenly—\nPat.\nA black-clothed figure had just vaulted over the wall of Windrock Palace.\n\"Who goes there!\"\nStartled, Jang Hwi drew his spear and shouted, while Jin Hayeon, who had been performing a massage on my back, immediately assumed a fighting stance and emitted a cold aura.\nBut upon seeing the intruder's face, their expressions shifted to bewilderment.\n\"Third Young Master. Would you care to explain the situation?\"\nThe unexpected visitor was Third Brother, Seo Wan-pyeong, who was supposedly away from headquarters on a mission.\nBut their surprise wasn't solely due to his appearance.\n\"I wanted to come through the main gate, but my hands were full, so I had no choice.\"\nOddly enough, Third Brother was carrying Kwon Mu-yeol on his left shoulder, holding him with his left hand, while his right hand held a tray with some refreshments and a teacup.\n'Wow... he didn't spill a single drop.'\nDespite jumping over the wall without using his hands, not a single drop of tea had spilled from the teacup on the tray in Third Brother's right hand.\nWhile Jang Hwi and Jin Hayeon were flabbergasted, I alone was leisurely admiring Third Brother's lightness skill.\nI already knew that Third Brother hadn't left headquarters. Though I also hadn't expected this dramatic entrance.\nRising from my prone position, I asked, \"Did he do something suspicious, brother?\"\nThird Brother nodded, dumping Kwan Mu-yeol unceremoniously onto the floor.\n\"After getting refreshments from the kitchen, he slipped into a secluded spot and added this to the tea.\"\nHe took out a leather pouch from his sleeve and tossed it to me.\nPat.\nCatching the pouch, I untied the string sealing the opening and found a colorful-looking mushroom inside.\n'Wow.... Anyone can see it's a poisonous mushroom.'\nBoth Jang Hwi and Jin Hayeon who peered over my shoulder had their expressions harden upon seeing the item inside.\n\"Given the circumstances, isn't it beyond doubt? We should execute him immediately. \"\nI shook my head at Jang Hwi's comment.\n\"There's no way this guy would target me on his own.\"\n\"Ah....\"\nUnlike Jang Hwi, who let out an exclamation as if he had just realized something, Jin Hayeon and Third Brother nodded as if they had expected as much.\nThen, Third Brother cautiously approached Kwon Mu-yeol and released his pressure point.\nHe kept the paralyzing point subdued and positioned his hand right in front of Kwon Mu-yeol's mouth in case he tried to bite his tongue or resort to some other trick.\nHowever, making such precautions meaningless, the man didn't choose suicide. Instead—\n\"It's a misunderstanding!!\"\nHe pleaded his innocence.\n\"You put this in my tea and call it a misunderstanding?\"\nWhen I chuckled sarcastically while shaking the pouch with the mushroom, Kwon Mu-yeol spoke in an uncharacteristically urgent tone.\n\"That tea wasn't meant for you, Young Master! I-I was going to drink it myself!\"\n\"Don't be ridicul—\"\nBefore I could finish, he blurted out another excuse.\n\"Remember our conversation about the Demonic Arts' side effects? I told you I was trying something new!\"\nIndeed, I remembered consulting with Kwon Mu-yeol when he said he was suffering from side effects similar to those of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\nAt that time, Kwon Mu-yeol had blushed as he admitted that when his obsessive compulsion became unbearable, he resorted to self-harm.\nLater, he mentioned trying a different approach, though it sounded so distasteful that I hadn’t pressed him further.\nBut that ‘something new’ was eating poison?\n\"No matter how I look at it, that sounds like a flimsy excuse. Do you really think taking poison would alleviate obsessive-compulsive disorder?\"\nIn response, Kwan Mu-yeol’s face twisted in sheer exasperation as he replied.\n\"Actually, that poisonous mushroom is poison, but not poison!\"\n\"Stop talking nonsense.\"\n\"Then let me drink it!\"\n\"!?\"\nMy expression transformed to that of sheer disbelief when he declared that he would drink the poisoned Dragon Well Tea.\nBut after the initial shock wore off, it seemed like a somewhat logical approach.\nBut Jang Hwi beside me chimed in, eyeing Kwan Mu-yeol with a wary look.\n\"Young Master, he might be trying to commit suicide by poison.\"\n\"Jang Hwi!! What are you saying!! Are you doubting me too!?\"\nWhile Kwon Mu-yeol and Jang Hwi were arguing, I turned my head to look at Third Brother, who was still restraining Kwon Mu-yeol.\nUnderstanding my unspoken question, he nodded.\n\"I'll monitor his vital signs. If he tries to commit suicide, I'll take immediate action.\"\nThe decision was made. We would let him drink the tea.\nIt wasn't just because I believed Kwon Mu-yeol's words.\n'Although the circumstances are suspicious, it's actually too suspicious to be believable.'\nThe previous assassination attempt had been blamed on the Murim Alliance. Would they now resort to such a simple and blatant method?\nDesperation was a possibility, but something felt off.\nWhile I was organizing my thoughts, Third Brother carefully tilted the teacup to Kwon Mu-yeol's mouth.\nFor a brief moment, we observed his reaction as he took a sip of the poisoned Dragon Well Tea.\nBut suddenly, something was off with Kwan Mu-yeol’s condition.\n\"Heek. Heheh.\"\nThe man who always wore a stoic, solemn expression suddenly relaxed, and he even started giggling while his eyes glazed over.\nHe giggled, babbling incoherently, like being possessed by a ghost.\nThen—\n\"......\"\nAs the effect of the poisonous mushroom seemed to wear off, Kwon Mu-yeol returned to his usual stoic face.\nNo, he looked a bit different.\nHis face was flushed red like a young man whose secret stash had been found by his mom.\nHe was trying hard to maintain a solemn expression to hide his embarrassment, but it wasn't working at all.\nEveryone had secrets they wished to hide, and we might have possibly witnessed what Kwon Mu-yeol wanted to hide the most.\n\"Ahem. I apologize.\"\nBut I felt wronged too. Witnessing such a spectacle wasn't pleasant.\n\"Why did you put that in my tea?\"\n\"As I said, it was for me.\"\nKwon Mu-yeol answered pitifully.\n\"Didn't you go to get my late-night snack?\"\n\"I intended to secretly sip the tea, then claim I’d spilled it by accident, and finally return to the kitchen to get another serving.\"\n\"At a time like this?\"\n\"Precisely because it’s a time like this.\"\n\"???\"\nSeeing everyone’s perplexed looks, Kwan Mu-yeol sighed deeply and said.\n\"Haven’t I failed in protecting you, Young Master? Because of that, my obsessive-compulsive symptoms have worsened more than usual. I felt like I was about to go insane from a heart demon. But I couldn't harm myself while on duty, so this was my only option.\"\nHis explanation left me feeling troubled as well.\n'These damn side effects are troublesome.'\nHaving experienced similar effects from my own Demonic Art, I couldn't dismiss his plight.\nI sighed softly and asked.\n\"Does this mushroom help with your compulsions?\"\n“A single large bite is lethal, but if you consume it in a small amount and dilute it with water beforehand, it can temporarily suppress the compulsions. I only use it in the case of emergencies.”\n\"Does anyone else know about this?\"\n“How could I reveal my reliance on such a thing? A Demonic Cult’s warrior succumbing to side effects would be seen as a disgrace.”\nHis shame wasn't merely from his bizarre behavior under the mushrooms’ influence.\nHe was deeply ashamed of his reliance on a poisonous mushroom to cope with his affliction. Having shown that to others must have increased his self-loathing even more.\nOf course, relying on such a thing wasn't ideal.\nThough from his perspective, it was medicine, not poison.\n'A poisonous mushroom can be medicine...'\nIt was a strange feeling.\nIt was something I'd heard often somewhere. Didn't someone say that what's poison to one person can be medicine to another, and what's medicine to one can be poison to another?\nWhile my thoughts about Demonic Arts' side effects, mental illness, poison, and medicine were getting complicated—\n\"Hmm?\"\nA certain memory buried in a corner of my mind resurfaced.\n\"Third Brother, did you have a late-night snack on the night I was attacked?\"\n\"As you might have known, I suffer from insomnia, so I tend to eat late-night snacks almost every day.\"\nHis answer solidified my suspicion.\nThird Brother also seemed to have guessed what I was thinking.\n\"But there was no poison. Do you think I wouldn't notice something like that?\"\nSeeing Third Brother about to succumb to paranoia again, I quickly replied.\n\"It wasn't poison.\"\n\"???\"\n\"It wasn't poison, but for you, it might as well be a deadly toxin.”\nI recalled a memory from my previous life as Seo Ji-hoon.\nSpecifically, a memory related to Lee Ji-yeon, who was arguing with a disgruntled citizen on the day I died.\nShe spent the early days of her job in tears and at some point suffered from depression.\nShe showed signs of avoiding certain foods during the period when her depression was severe, though it was somewhat less after she completely darkened later.\nThe reason was that these foods had a negative impact on depression.\nIn other words—\n\"There are foods and drinks, besides poison, that can make one agitated or depressed, Third Brother.\"\nFoods that are bad for depression patients do exist, and on top of that, Third Brother was a severely depressed patient suffering from extreme paranoia.\n\"Non-poisonous foods can make one depressed?\"\nThird Brother tilted his head with a look of incomprehension, and the others also had strange expressions.\n\"Yes. Just as the poisonous mushroom that Warrior Kwan ate became medicine to him, what's beneficial to one can be harmful to another. Also, aren't there some ordinary drinks or foods that are fine when eaten separately but cause problems when eaten together?\"\nThis much was common knowledge even in this era, as everyone nodded with understanding expressions.\n\"There are also foods and drinks that induce relaxation and drowsiness. Or those reputed to boost virility.\"\n\"Hmm. In folk tales, they say that any food rumored to be good for virility quickly becomes extinct.\"\nAs someone who frequently leaves headquarters on missions, he nodded as if he understood the concept.\nJin Hayeon frowned at the talk about virility, though.\n\"Conversely, some foods, while not poisonous, can heighten irritability. For ordinary people, these are good foods because they sharpen the mind and increase concentration. But for those who are already sensitive and sharp, they're as good as poison.\"\n\"Indeed.\" Get full chapters from novel-fire.ɴet\nThird Brother, aware that he filled those criteria, nodded with an understanding expression.\nHowever, true to his paranoid nature, he didn't let it go.\n\"But how do you know all this?\"",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 45 : History is Made at Night (3)",
    "content": "Chapter 45: History is Made at Night (3)\nA flicker of doubt passed through the eyes of those watching me.\nGood thing I already had a decent excuse ready.\n\"You probably know that before becoming Master's disciple, I worked as a waiter at an inn.\"\n\"You learned this while working as a waiter?\"\n\"Yes. The innkeeper who took me in and raised me was both owner and chef. He had a profound understanding of various drinks and dishes, and occasionally shared his culinary knowledge with me.\"\nSince my supposed teacher was deceased, how could they possibly verify the truth of my words?\nPerhaps misinterpreting my explanation, Third Brother muttered in admiration, \"My, he must have been a truly remarkable chef. To think he was a cook who considered not only the combination of ingredients but also a person's constitution and temperament. Such a pity he died due to those Alliance bastards.\nThird Brother suddenly expressed cold fury toward the Murim Alliance.\nCaught off guard by this unexpected turn, I appeased him by saying,\n\"He was indeed a person of excellent character. I will never forgive those Murim Alliance bastards who assassinated such a person.\"\nWhile my vow of revenge was genuine, I sensed the conversation veering off course, so I swiftly steered it back on track.\n\"Anyway, the important point is that it might be possible to induce Qi Deviation through foods or drinks. Therefore, we need to investigate the late-night snack Third Brother ate that night and those who prepared it.\"\n\"Then, we should capture those who prepared the snack and order them to remake what they gave me that night. I will leave it to you since you seem to know something about this matter.\"\nI flinched involuntarily.\n'I... don't really know much?'\nI just saw Lee Ji-yeon avoid certain foods; I didn't know much about what foods are bad for depression.\nOf course, out of curiosity, I had searched the internet once, but it’s impossible for me to recall all of those details.\nBesides, apart from feeling sorry for Lee Ji-yeon, I wasn’t depressed at that moment.\n\"They might covertly change the ingredients when making it, Senior Brother.\"\n\"Hahaha. Don't worry. Though I'm ignorant about food, my training against poisons has given me an excellent memory for tastes, smells, and textures.\"\nHe boasts all of that as if it’s something to be proud of.\nI could only nod in agreement lest any further excuses would trigger another bout of his paranoia.\n\"Then, I'll leave it to you, Senior Brother.\"\nMeanwhile, I silently prayed that the culprits had used something I might recognize.\n\"As a precaution, I will temporarily seal this man's acupoints.\"\nWith those words, my Senior Brother vanished instantly into the darkness.\n“You’ll be released soon if you are truly innocent, Warrior Kwan. Bear with it for a while.”\n\"Understood, Young Master.\"\nConcerned about the possibility of a suicide attempt, I discreetly moved closer to him.\nWhile I was looking at him with a look of suspicion mixed with pity—\n\"Young Master!!\"\nKwan Mu-yeol suddenly shouted in an alarmed voice. Puzzled, I turned my head following his gaze, and what met my eyes was—\nSwoooosh!\nThe sight of a spear tip flying toward me at tremendous speed.\nThe moment Seo Wan-pyeong appeared while carrying Kwan Mu-yeol on his shoulder, Jang Hwi realized something was going wrong.\n'Damn. He was suspicious of us all along.'\nHe had clearly heard that the Third Young Master had left the headquarters due to a mission directly assigned by the Heavenly Demon.\nYet here he was, suddenly appearing out of nowhere.\nAnd the ensuing conversation between the Third Young Master and the Eighth Young Master about Kwan Mu-yeol confirmed his fear to certainty.\nThat’s why Jang Hwi had subtly tried to steer the direction of the conversation.\n\"Given the circumstances, isn't it beyond doubt? We should execute him immediately.\"\nIf Kwan Mu-yeol took the blame here and died, the suspicion towards himself would lessen. Furthermore, it would make the Eighth Young Master lower his guard, believing he had caught the culprit.\nHowever, the usually flippant and deceitful Eighth Young Master was surprisingly not easy to deal with.\n\"There's no way this guy would target me on his own.\"\nThe Eighth Young Master chose interrogation over execution, and Jang Hwi had no choice but to observe the situation quietly while trying his best to frame Kwan Mu-yeol.\n\"Young Master, he might be trying to commit suicide by poison.\"\nBut, damn it, it didn't work on Eighth Young Master.\nJang Hwi decided to just observe the situation, knowing that pressing further might cast suspicion on himself.\nIf only that topic hadn't come up.\n\"Even among non-poisonous foods or drinks, there are those that make people sensitive or depressed, Third Brother.\"\nThe moment those words left the Eighth Young Master's mouth, Jang Hwi had to use all his effort to maintain his composure.\n'How does he know about that!?'\nWhat they used on Third Young Master this time, and what they had used to kill Fifth Young Master disguised as Qi Deviation, wasn't poison. It was a specific type of food, practically unknown in the Central Plain, let alone within the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nBecause of this, Jang Hwi struggled to control his expression while his mind frantically thought of solutions.\n'Should I just wait?'\nWhile the Eighth Young Master had the correct hypothesis, there was no guarantee he knew about that food, let alone guessed correctly what it was amongst the ingredients.\nThe problem was—\n'If the Eighth Young Master discovers it, there's a risk that the truth of Fifth Young Master's death will also be exposed.'\nIf that happened, not only lowly members like himself but even the Sacred Order might be wiped out.\nAfter much deliberation, Jang Hwi made his decision.\n'It's certain. That man is a hindrance to our plans. And now is the opportunity to kill him.'\nThe Third Young Master had left to capture others, and Kwan Mu-yeol's pressure points were sealed.\nAll that remained was to kill the man and then deal with Jin Hayeon.\nOf course, the aftermath of such a blatant assassination would be disastrous.\n‘But compared to the possibility of ‘that thing’ being exposed by the Eighth Young Master, it is safer for me to take the blame alone and die.'\nHe judged that the possibility of the upper echelons being swept away was much lower this way. ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ Novᴇl_Fire(.)net\nThough his deliberation was lengthy, his action was swift.\nPat!\nAs swift as a bolt of lightning, Jang Hwi instantly closed in on the Eighth Young Master and—\n\"Young Master!\"\nSwoooosh!\nBy the time Kwan Mu-yeol realized what was happening and shouted, Jang Hwi's spear was already barreling toward Il-mok.\n\"!?\"\nEyes filled with surprise and bewilderment looked at the spear.\nJust as Jang Hwi's spear was about to pierce Il-mok's face—\nChang!!!\nWith a jarring screech of metal, the spear's trajectory was subtly altered.\nThanks to that, the spear blade, which should have pierced Il-mok’s face, grazed the surface skin of Il-mok's cheekbone, leaving a shallow cut.\n\"Damn it.\"\nJang Hwi cursed and glared at the owner of the palm that had struck the shaft of his spear.\nJin Hayeon.\n'I almost died.'\nMy heart was pounding violently.\nThat instinctive reaction of stepping back in that final moment and Jin Hayeon’s timely strike to the spear’s shaft had narrowly saved me from a fatal blow.\n'How did she know?'\nI couldn't understand how Jin Hayeon had reacted so quickly to Jang Hwi's sneak attack.\nPerhaps her speech about being constantly vigilant from that night is not empty talk.\nBut now wasn’t the time for such reflections.\n\"Get out of the way!\"\nBang!\nThough Jin Hayeon had miraculously managed to save me, the difference in skill was evident.\nContrary to her emotionless façade, making it seem as if she is his equal, I could clearly see her being pushed back with each clash.\nShe was too young and inexperienced to fight someone like Jang Hwi.\n'Since his target is me, I should flee to draw his attention just like with the Eldest Brother last time.’\nI was about to move and execute this plan when—\n\"Release my pressure points, Young Master!\"\nI hurriedly reached out to him and shouted, \"Where and how should I release them!?\"\nKwan Mu-yeol rapidly explained the mechanism and how to undo it. Il-mok, without hesitation, channeled his Qi and jabbed his fingers at the designated points.\n\"Urgh...\"\nIt seemed I had miscalculated my strength control, as Kwan Mu-yeol let out a painful groan. Nevertheless, now freed from his restraints, he sprang to his feet and drew his saber.\nBang!\nOn the other hand, Jin Hayeon, overwhelmed by the strength contained within the spear was pushed back ten steps.\n\"Jang Hwi, you bastard!!\"\nKwan Mu-yeol rushed in to replace Jin Hayeon and swung his saber at Jang Hwi.\nClang! Clang!\nWielding the longer-reaching spear, Jang Hwi parried Kwan Mu-yeol's advances with a series of concise movements. Kwan Mu-yeol, in turn, blocked and evaded while using minimal movements as he closed the distance.\nHowever—\n\"Kuk.\"\nAs he tried to get closer, wounds gradually accumulated on Kwan Mu-yeol's body.\n\"You bastard. You were hiding your skills all along!\"\nKwan Mu-yeol shouted with a vexed expression and Jang Hwi's face wasn't particularly bright either.\nIt was becoming increasingly difficult to kill Il-mok.\nWhat's more—\n\"I'll join you.\"\nJin Hayeon, blood smearing her lips from her internal injuries, stepped forward to aid Kwan Mu-yeol.\nFaced with their combined assault from both sides, Jang Hwi's spear became increasingly unstable.\nChang!\nKwan Mu-yeol, who had been calmly deflecting or blocking Jang Hwi’s spear until now, seized an opportunity and struck Jang-hoe’s spear with force.\nThis was a characteristic of the Breaking Heaven Spiritless Saber Art that Kwan Mu-yeol had mastered. A martial art centered around using minimal movements before unleashing a decisive blow.\nHis powerful strike paid off and Jang Hwi’s spear, struck by the immense force, bounced high upward.\nPat!\nNot missing the opportunity, Jin Hayeon rushed in and thrust her left palm toward the area near Jang Hwi's heart.\nHowever, in that brief moment, Jang Hwi twisted his upper body violently and narrowly dodged that strike.\nBut the crisis wasn’t over.\nPat!\nWith Jang Hwi’s attention diverted, Kwan Mu-yeol managed to close the distance and swung his sword with the intention to bisect Jang Hwi’s body. Simultaneously, Jin Hayeon followed up with a right palm strike targeting Jang Hwi’s leg.\nSlash .\nThwack!\nKwan Mu-yeol’s saber cleanly sliced Jang Hwi’s side and Jin Hayeon’s palm froze his thigh.\nHowever, instead of a victorious face, the one that was etched in Kwan Mu-yeol’s face right now is that of defeat.\nEven as his body was torn to pieces, Jang Hwi had managed to throw his spear at Il-mok.\nIt wasn't a desperate improvisation.\nFrom the moment the fight had dragged on, Jang Hwi had been planning to die together with Il-mok. He hadn't twisted his body to avoid Jin Hayeon's attack; he had done so to position himself for this final throw.\nThe spear Jang Hwi threw tore through the air at incredible speed toward Il-mok, imbued with sharp spear qi.\nJin Hayeon, who always looked so calm, now stared at Il-mok with despair in her eyes.\n\"!?\"\nBut then, a rare surprise crept onto her face.\nFor some reason, despite the spear ripping through the air toward him, Il-mok's face was inexplicably serene.\nIt wasn't that Il-mok had anticipated this.\nHe had simply been immersed in martial arts since a certain moment—specifically, from the instant of Jang Hwi's first sneak attack.\nThe body that had faced a life-threatening crisis triggered explosive concentration for survival.\nEven as his heart pounded violently, the world seemed to flow in slow motion.\nThe fight between Jang Hwi, Kwan Mu-yeol, and Jin Hayeon—all far superior to himself—appeared crystal clear to Il-mok.\nHe saw the flow of their moves, the subtleties of their techniques, and the true intention of their martial arts, sparking a cascade of insights within his mind.\nAnd at this very moment—\nThe ferocious spear flying to take his life became the catalyst that burst open the understanding that had accumulated to saturation.\nHis internal energy, bolstered by the consumption of the Explosive Demonic Pill, instantly surged from his dantian all at once.\nIt was a massive flow of energy that Il-mok had never felt or handled before. But the meridians widened and cleansed by the Bone Marrow Cleansing withstood the tremendous energy flow.\nThe energy raced inside Il-mok’s body circulated according to the cultivation principles of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword. It kept circulating, amplifying, before finally converging to the palm that gripped his sword.\nFlash!!\nThe first form of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword that he had practiced countless times was unfolded perfectly. The sword departed from its sheath, wreathed in a grey aura.\nIt’s been half a year since Il-mok started learning the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\nThat was the time it took for Il-mok to manifest Sword Qi.",

    "content": "Chapter 46: Medical Ward (1)\nBOOM!!!!\nA massive explosion erupted as Il-mok's sword clashed with Jang Hwi's spear.\nThe three onlookers shared similar expressions of shock. They were all astonished because they knew how long Il-mok had been learning martial arts.\nBut after the initial shock, each face revealed a different emotion.\n'Damn it...'\nJang Hwi, who had been aiming for a killing blow, felt frustration. Having witnessed Il-mok's incredible talent, his failure to eliminate him would now haunt him even more.\nMeanwhile, concern shadowed both Jin Hayeon and Kwan Mu-yeol's faces.\n\"Cough...\"\nIl-mok had managed to block the incoming spear, but the difference in skill was undeniable. He was pushed back about ten paces before coughing up blood.\n\"Young Master!\"\n\"Damn it...\"\nAfter spitting blood, Il-mok cursed with an expression of wounded pride.\n'Being able to manifest sword qi in half a year would be enough to call him a genius.'\n'Is his pride hurt because he nearly died?'\nAs Kwan Mu-yeol and Jin Hayeon were each lost in their thoughts...\n\"My realm... has risen again...\"\nIl-mok muttered with a wronged expression, then collapsed to the ground.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nAmidst the strange silence, the trio—engaged in their fierce battle moments ago—stared in bewilderment at the fallen Il-mok.\n'A familiar ceiling.'\nThat was my first thought upon opening my eyes.\nBut it wasn't Windrock Palace where I usually slept.\nIt was a place I had stayed once before—the medical ward's ceiling.\n\"Are you feeling better, Young Master?\"\nRight on timing, Jin Hayeon’s voice reached my ears.\nTurning my head, I saw Jin Hayeon looking down at me with her usual stoic expression, bandages wrapped around various parts of her body.\nMaster was also beside her.\n\"Five attacks in just half a year, three brushes with death, and two stays in the medical ward—what a busy life you have.\"\nI couldn't help but smile bitterly at Master's words.\nFrom Eldest Brother's rampage, to the crazed Branch Leader of Kuqa County, the bandit attack, the recent assassin, and now Jang Hwi—my days had been nothing if not eventful. But my bitter smile wasn't because of that.\n'The old man conveniently left out what he did.'\nThe very first attack I faced, and the most dangerous moment of all, was undoubtedly when Master held a sword to my throat and threatened to make me his disciple.\nIn fact, all these troubles began from that moment, and moreover...\n'Honestly, compared to Master's aura that day, the rest feel like nothing...'\nHe was the main culprit who unnecessarily inflated my courage.\n\"Still, I'm glad your achievements are progressing rapidly because of it. People naturally grow stronger through adversity, so don't worry too much.\"\n\"...Yes, Master.\"\nDid he develop a sixth sense after I cursed him so much?\nBut there was a more important matter at hand.\n'Right. My level has risen...'\nThe thought made my whole body itch for some action.\nTo be honest, I couldn't exactly remember how I had created sword qi. Only a vague sense of that feeling remained.\nWhich meant...\n—I need to recapture that feeling right now!\n—Grab a sword quickly!\n—This is my only chance!\nMy obsessive-compulsive tendencies were flaring up.\nWhile fiercely battling with some voice in my head, Master's voice brought me back to reality.\n\"Though I'd like to order you to rest until you've fully recovered, there's an urgent matter to handle first. Let's take care of that and then you can rest.\"\n\"An urgent matter, Master?\"\n\"I've heard the full situation from Wan-pyeong and Hayeon. Wan-pyeong has completed all preparations; you should finish what you have started.\"\n\"Ah...\"\nOnly then did I recall what had happened before I fainted.\nWith Jin Hayeon's support, I got up and followed Master out of the medical ward.\nOutside, the sky was still dark.\n\"How long was I asleep?\"\n\"Perhaps less than two hours, Young Master.\"\nAfter exchanging a brief conversation with Jin Hayeon, we soon arrived at the kitchen.\nThe place responsible for Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's foods and drinks.\nHowever, the atmosphere was unusual.\n'Wow... It's like a scene from a historical drama.'\nTorches illuminated the center of the facility, and dozens of warriors maintained vigilant guard around the area, exuding a solemn presence.\nIn the center, several men and women knelt like criminals.\nThe scene resembled an interrogation straight out of a historical drama.\nMaster walked through this grim spectacle, sat down in the prepared seat at the head position, and commanded.\n\"Begin.\"\nI expected an interrogation to start, but what followed was unexpected.\nTwo of the kneeling individuals—a man and a woman—stood up and suddenly began brewing tea and preparing refreshments.\n\"Il-mok, watch carefully the ingredients and tea those people are handling.\"\nUnderstanding the situation, I approached them with Jin Hayeon's support and began examining the ingredients they were using.\nAs I observed the process of preparing the refreshments, one thought dominated my mind:\n'Well... I fucked up.'\nI don't know if it's because my head isn't working properly as my injuries haven't healed yet, but honestly, I couldn't discern anything unusual.\nTo my eyes, they were just using ordinary ingredients to make ordinary snacks and brew ordinary tea.\n'Should I just pin the blame on someone? Or should I honestly say I don't know?'\nYes, considering Jang Hwi's sudden attack and everything else, something suspicious was definitely going on.\nMaybe if I just made something up, it would work?\nWhile I was pondering this, the refreshment table was fully prepared.\n\"How is it?\"\nWhen Master's question reached my ears, I felt as if eons were passing.\nAfter countless deliberations, I made my decision.\n\"I didn't notice anything unusual.\"\nI couldn't risk causing trouble with false accusations.\nUpon hearing my answer, Master made a strange expression and looked at Third Brother, who had been waiting beside him.\n\"Taste it.\"\n\"Yes, Master.\"\nThird Brother gave me a glance before approaching the prepared refreshment table.\n\"First, the appearance is similar to what was served that day, Master.\"\nAfter saying this, he took a bite of the refreshment and then lifted a teacup to sip the tea.\n\"...The taste and aroma are different from what we had that day, Master.\"\nI inwardly sighed with relief at Third Brother's words. It seemed I had made the right choice by being honest.\nMaster's face darkened in anger.\n\"How dare you mock me now?\"\nThe two who had prepared the food prostrated themselves, crying out,\n\"We're innocent!\"\n\"We prepared it exactly as we did that day! The taste of food can differ depending on one's mood. Third Young Master perceives it differently because you suspect us!\"\nKilling intent surged from his body upon hearing their defense.\n\"You dare treat me like a fool in front of Master? The refreshments and tea today look and taste similar to those from that day, but something is missing. That day, the sweetness and flavor were much stronger, and the tea was likewise much more bitter and intense.\"\nHis words triggered a memory in me. Thɪs chapter is updatᴇd by NoveI(F)ire.net\n'Come to think of it, even coffee or carbonated drinks can be dangerous for sensitive people if they drink too much. Could it be that they didn't use anything special, but instead made the tea much stronger to enhance its effect?'\nIt was possible, but that alone seemed insufficient.\n'Senior Brother said something was missing from the taste of the snacks too, so there must be more to it.'\nWhile I was contemplating whether to interject, the two accused continued to proclaim their innocence in response to Third Brother's accusations.\nSuddenly, several men emerged from the darkness.\nOne of them had a face familiar to me.\n'Master's personal guard.'\nThe man who had driven the carriage when Master first abducted me. The leader of Master's elite guards and the Pavilion Lord of the Hidden Guard Pavilion.\nThey each presented something they had retrieved.\n\"These are the items we found after thoroughly searching the kitchen and the quarters where they stay.\"\nMaster nodded at the Pavilion Lord’s report and then instructed me,\n\"Come and examine these.\"\nAs I approached Master with Jin Hayeon's support, a thought crossed my mind.\n'Master is meticulous.'\nHe had quickly gathered the suspects to prevent them from destroying evidence, then had his direct subordinates collect evidence.\nAs I reached them, I began examining the various items they presented.\nMost were unfamiliar to me, but there was one thing I recognized among them.\n'Wow. I can't believe this actually exists in this era.'\nDark brown, bean-like objects with a sweet yet bitter aroma—coffee beans.\nLike most Korean office workers drowning in work, government employees also enjoyed coffee during morning commutes or after lunch.\nI often drank coffee with fellow officials in my department, and Lee Ji Yeon was no exception.\nBut from a certain day, she stopped drinking coffee.\n—I'll buy the coffee today.\n—Jihoon, I'd like chamomile tea instead of coffee, please.\n—Hmm? Now that I think about it, you haven't been drinking coffee lately, Ji-yeon?\n—Ah, yes... it doesn't suit my taste anymore.\nIt seemed strange that someone who had been drinking coffee just fine for months would suddenly claim it didn't suit her taste.\nAnd that afternoon, I learned the reason from her colleague, Kim Changwan.\n—I think the stress from dealing with civilians’ complaints was too much. She recently went to a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with depression and panic disorder.\nThe news was quite shocking, and I felt sorry for her, but I was also puzzled.\n—But what does coffee have to do with depression?\n—I'm not entirely sure, but apparently drinking coffee when you have severe depression can cause heart palpitations and increased anxiety. It can also make you feel like you're about to have a panic attack.\n—I see...\nAfter hearing that story, I vaguely remembered searching the internet out of curiosity about the side effects of caffeine and foods that worsen depression.\nOf course, since I didn't have depression at the time, I just looked it up once and moved on. The details were hazy in my memory.\nAlso, there was no guarantee that those people had actually fed coffee to Senior Brother. I didn't even know if coffee existed in this era.\nSo I was worried something I didn't recognize might appear, but as luck would have it, coffee was exactly what they had used.\nIt was absurd in many ways, but now there was a more pressing matter.\n\"Third Brother, was the missing taste and aroma similar to this?\"\nI held out the coffee beans to Third Brother. He sniffed it and then popped a bean into his mouth.\n\"Yes! This is the missing taste and aroma!\"\nAt his exclamation, I turned to Master.\n\"Master, this is originally an ingredient used to make a type of drink by pouring boiling water over it. This drink enhances mental acuity and improves concentration, but it also has side effects such as insomnia, heightened anxiety, and potentially worsening feelings of depression.\"\n\"Is that what you learned from the innkeeper?\"\n\"Yes, Master.\"\nI apologized mentally to the late Uncle Taehyun, since I couldn't reveal my past life memories, so I had to improvise.\nSatisfied with my explanation, Master nodded and issued orders.\n\"Imprison them immediately and interrogate them to find out who's behind this. Also, investigate all their past activities to find anyone involved, and determine the source of those evil beans.\"\n\"As you command!\"\nAs the assembled individuals bowed their heads in obedience, the accused cried out in indignation,\n\"This is slander, Heavenly Demon!\"\n\"Third Young Master! I've served you for over ten years—how could you do this to me? And didn't I also eat the same refreshments that night?! This is unjust!\"\n\"Didn't you hear him? It amplifies depression! It may be medicine for healthy people, but it was revealed to be poison for me! How dare you wag your tongues!\"\nBut the enraged Third Brother wasn't fooled by their act.\nAfter watching them being dragged away for a while...\n'So, is my job done now?'\nI breathed a sigh of relief.\nOf course, further interrogations and investigations would be needed to reveal who was behind this, but that wasn't my responsibility. I didn't particularly have talents for such things anyway.\nAnd above all, I had no time for such things right now.\n\"Master.\"\nRight now, I have something more urgent than anything else.\n\"Speak.\"\nWith Master's permission, I answered in a rather serious tone.\n\"Then, I shall return to Windrock Palace for training.\"\nSince waking up, my mind had been constantly replaying the memory of creating sword qi.\nI wanted to swing a sword right away, and this bizarre interrogation was driving me mad.\nBut Master frowned as if he couldn't understand my words.\n\"Training?\"\n\"Yes. I must immediately internalize the insights I gained...\"\nBefore I could finish my explanation...\nDarkness consumed my vision.\nThud.\n\"Young Master?\"\nJin Hayeon, who had been supporting Il-mok, murmured with a puzzled tone as he suddenly lost consciousness mid-sentence.\nWhat jolted her from her confusion was the voice of the Heavenly Demon, who was like a god to her.\n\"I pressed his pressure point.\"\nNow she understood that the Heavenly Demon had knocked out his youngest disciple.\n\"Having overwhelming talent comes with its own problems. To suffer such side effects...\"\nThe Heavenly Demon examined the unconscious Il-mok with a sympathetic expression, then instructed Jin Hayeon.\n\"Until the injuries he sustained today are fully healed, wake him only for meals, and force him back to sleep after he finishes eating. His body could be damaged by excessive training.\"\nSupporting Il-mok, Jin Hayeon responded to the Heavenly Demon's command.\n\"I will follow your orders.\"\nFor the time being, Il-mok wouldn't be troubled by insomnia.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 47 : Medical Ward (2)",
    "content": "Chapter 47: Medical Ward (2)\nWhile Il-mok was knocked out, courtesy of the Heavenly Demon, various events were unfolding at the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nThe investigations of those connected to the assassination attempts of the Third Young Master continued. They also relentlessly pursued any clue regarding the late-night snack that had affected Seo Wan-pyeong and interrogated Jang Hwi just as relentlessly.\nJang Hwi, despite his side being cleanly sliced by Kwan Mu-yeol’s saber strike and getting his leg amputated due to suffering from frostbite—courtesy of Jin Hayeon’s palm strike—managed to escape from death, albeit barely.\nAs the interrogations and investigations progressed, the evidence began to point to a specific individual as the culprit.\nHowever, the investigation concluded in a rather anticlimactic manner.\nLate at night.\nTwo elderly men met at their usual gathering place.\nThe man on the right, after a moment of observing the empty seat usually occupied by the Divine Guardian, addressed the man in the center.\n\"I didn't expect you to act personally.\"\n\"Since it involved the Divine Guardian, I couldn't entrust it to anyone else.\"\nThe old man on the right hesitated for a moment before asking, “But to stage it as a suicide? Do you think the Heavenly Demon would fall for such a trick?\"\nAmong those who had prepared the assassination attempt for Seo Wan-pyeong, including Jang Hwi, was a member of the Sacred Order.\nFurthermore, during the investigation, they managed to trace back the Black Bean Demon Tea’s origin (黑豆魔茶) to the Divine Guardian.\n(TL Note: Yes, that’s coffee. The Source of All the World’s Evil, lol)\nAnd this thing that they called Black Bean Demon Tea was something the old man in the center had given to the Divine Guardian. Naturally, if things continued as is, the old man in the center would inevitably become implicated.\nThat’s why the old man had decisively eliminated the Divine Guardian.\nHe had personally gone to kill him and staged it as a suicide by poison.\nHe even forged a suicide note imitating the Divine Guardian's handwriting.\nAnd after orchestrating all this, the central elder replied nonchalantly, \"The Heavenly Demon would certainly not be fooled.\"\n\"!?\"\nRegardless of the old man on the right’s shock, the old man in the center continued with an indifferent expression, “But what does it matter? The tail has been cut off, so it will be difficult to trace it back to us now. The dead tell no tales, don’t they?\"\n\"Ah....\"\nThe old man on the right let out a sigh filled with mixed emotions before quickly composing himself.\n'He's more dangerous than I expected.'\nThe prerequisite of staging the Divine Guardian’s death as a suicide by poison is that there must be no trace of resistance in the scene. Conversely, if you think about it, this also means that the Divine Guardian couldn’t even react to the attack.\nSure, the old man in the center’s action must have caught the Divine Guardian off guard. But still, the Divine Guardian himself was one of the top martial artists within the cult.\nTo kill such a person without giving them a chance to resist and then disguise it as suicide...\nAs the old man on the right struggled to suppress his shock and fear, the old man in the center spoke again.\n\"However, this incident has likely sharpened the Heavenly Demon's vigilance, so we should lie low for a while. Moreover, we've lost a valuable chess piece, which will significantly hinder our grand plan.\"\n\"I never expected things would go this far because of that child.\"\nBoth elders simultaneously thought of the Heavenly Demon's youngest disciple.\nDuring the brief silence that followed, the elder on the right realized something strange and asked, \"By the way, can you tell me the source of that Black Bean Demon Tea? You claimed no one would know about it, yet if even a mere inn attendant could identify it, it must not be from a very reliable source.\"\nAt that question, the old man in the center’s expression instantly turned cold. It wasn’t out of anger toward those who had provided the Black Bean Demon Tea.\n'Come to think of it, black bean demon tea isn't something a mere server would know about.'\nIt was a product that had only recently become popular in the distant Western regions and was virtually unknown in the Central Plains or here in Xinjiang.\nEven if one searched the entire Central Plains, only a select few would recognize it, and they are certainly not a mere innkeeper or server.\nThe problem was that pointing this out to the Heavenly Demon would be tantamount to confessing their own guilt.\n'Should I send word to them and request an investigation into the Eight Young Master’s past?'\nHe briefly considered this but then shook his head.\nHe couldn't show weakness to them. Appearing incompetent—being manipulated by a mere fifteen-year-old and unable to gather proper information—could become a vulnerability in the future.\nBesides, there was no need to investigate the past of the Eighth Young Master.\nHaving organized his thoughts, the central elder smiled coldly, lifting only the corners of his mouth.\n\"Rather than the origin of the Black Bean Demon Tea, isn’t it more important to figure out how to deal with that brat?\"\n\"Didn't you say we should lie low for a while?\"\nAt the old man on the right’s question, the coldly smiling old man turned his head toward the west.\n\"We don't necessarily need to act directly. For example, an unfortunate accident could occur during training at the Hall of the Demonic Way, don’t you think?\"\n\"......\"\nThe old man on the right, who hadn’t expected the old man’s influence to extend even to the Hall of the Demonic Way, could only remain silent.\nA few days later.\nAfter waking up in the medical ward, Il-mok ate the meal that Jin Hayeon had brought as usual, then heaved a deep sigh.\nWith the expression of a prisoner awaiting his final fate, Il-mok closed his eyes, only to open them again shortly after with a puzzled look.\n\"What are you doing?\"\nAt Il-mok's question, Jin Hayeon furrowed her brow.\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Knocking me out. Aren’t you going to knock me out again?\"\nFor the past few days, except for meal times and bathroom breaks, Il-mok had been forced into a deep sleep by Jin Hayeon.\n\"According to the Demonic Physician, your body has now fully recovered.\"\n\"Haah.\"\nIl-mok unconsciously let out a sigh of relief.\nAfter watching him for a moment, Jin Hayeon spoke in her usual blunt tone, \"Therefore, you can now return to Windrock Palace. I've prepared everything.\"\nIl-mok got up and left the medical ward with her.\nOn the way back to Windrock Palace, Ilmok learned from Jin Hayeon about what had happened while he was asleep.\nDuring the extensive investigation of the Sacred Order, the Divine Guardian had been found dead by suicide, accompanied by a note.\nAnd surprisingly, the one who welcomed Il-mok upon his arrival at Windrock Palace was the Heavenly Demon himself.\n\"I heard from the Demonic Physician. Now that your body has recovered, isn't it time to begin training again?\"\n\"......\"\nPlanning to work with a patient who had just recovered enough to rise from his sickbed—what a merciless old man.\nAs if reading my thoughts, the Master added, “Aren’t you feeling restless because of the side effects anyway? It’s safer for me to oversee your training rather than you pushing yourself alone.\"\n\"Ahem. I am nothing but grateful for Master's consideration.\"\nPretending to be moved, I bowed respectfully before drawing my sword.\nRuthless training schedule aside, it was true that my body was feeling restless.\n\"Whew.\"\nAfter a deep breath to calm my mind, I recalled the events of that night.\nThe sight of Jang Hwi's hurled spear flying toward me. The sensation of the world moving in slow motion.\nThe powerful flow of internal energy that had surged from my lower abdomen through all the meridians in my body.\nBut.\nWheeeeeing.\nThe sword I drew using the Soul-Departing Sword only emitted a strong resonating sound.\nIt didn’t produce the same clear sword qi as before.\nHow should I put it? My mind roughly remembered, but my body couldn't keep up.\nNo, it didn’t feel like it was properly ingrained in my head either.\nThe overwhelming enlightenment had come and gone in a flash, leaving my mind struggling to process it.\nAnd since I had been unconscious for several days, all those insights had become blurred.\n'Damn it. Should I have trained immediately back then?'\nI tried performing the Soul-Departing Sword technique several more times, but something was still lacking.\nWatching my struggles, Master prescribed an extreme remedy.\n\"Hmm. It seems the passage of time has blurred your insights.\"\n\"...It appears so.\"\n\"Then, if we recreate the same situation as before, perhaps some of that enlightenment will return.\"\n\"The same situation as then...?\"\nWhile I wore a puzzled expression.\nSuddenly, an immense wave of energy swirled around Master, and a terrifying killing intent pressed down on my entire body.\nSimultaneously, Master's drawn sword flashed towards my heart.\n\"Eek!?\" I shrieked involuntarily and swung his sword\nSlash.\nEven worse, my sword, still lacking the sword qi, was cut off in one strike.\nWith his sword now touching my chest, Master spoke, \"It seems you grow stronger faster in life-threatening situations, so we’ll train like this until you regain the enlightenment from that day.\"\n\"Gulp....\"\nI unconsciously swallowed hard.\nWhat the fuck does he think I am? A Saiyan from the Dragon Ball series who grows stronger by screaming and facing death as if eating breakfast?!\n\"Ha, haha. M-Master? E-Even so, isn’t there a difference between real combat and training?\"\nIn response to my comment, Master withdrew the sword from my chest and smiled gently.\n\"Hehehe. The human body is simpler than you think. Even if you think in your head that you won’t die, your body will react on its own. And most importantly.\"\nMaster's smile faded as he once again exuded tremendous killing intent and energy while saying, \"Can you truly guarantee that you won't die?\"\nMy bones chilled, and every hair on my body stood on end.\nEven more intensely than when I was ambushed by Jang Hwi that night.\n\"Huff... Huff...\"\nThough only about two hours had passed, sweat poured like rain from my exhausted body.\nHaving faced Master's tremendous killing intent and energy waves for two hours straight, not only my body but my mental energy had been severely depleted.\n\"Hahaha. See? It works!\"\nBut in exchange, I succeeded in manifesting the sword qi on my blade.\nWheeeeeing.\nThe sword qi, like a mirage, would scatter and disappear the moment my concentration wavered.\nThanks to Master's threats, my forcibly heightened concentration allowed me to occasionally manifest sword qi.\nOf course, maintaining this forcibly elevated state of concentration doubled my mental strain.\nIn addition, there was another subtle benefit.\n'I'm so exhausted that the side effects seem to have subsided a bit.'\nWhether it was because I had somewhat caught up to the enlightenment from that night or simply because I was tired, the other self that had been screaming in a corner of my mind had quieted down a bit.\n\"That's enough training for today, so take some rest.\"\nMaster, who had been driving me to the brink of death for two hours, had returned to his gentle demeanor.\n\"Master. Before you leave, could we speak briefly?\"\nEven in my exhausted state, I forced myself to hold Master from leaving.\nNow that the side effects had somewhat subsided, there were a few things I needed to discuss in advance.\n\"Speak.\"\n\"I've heard the situation briefly from Miss Jin, but I find it rather odd.\"\nAt my comment, Master nodded.\n\"This old man is also aware of that issue. However, with the Divine Guardian's suicide, the trail of evidence has been cut off. And we can't torture and purge everyone at headquarters, can we?\"\nI couldn’t argue with that.\nBased on the atmosphere and Master's character as I had observed it, he wasn't the type to just let things end like this.\nHe was probably continuing the investigation in secret, waiting for the big fish to make a move so he could capture them in one fell swoop. ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ novelFɪre.net\n\"I’ll keep an eye on that issue, so you focus on your training. The entrance exam for the Hall of the Demonic Way is less than half a year away.\"\nAs Master turned to leave after saying this, I hurriedly stopped again.\n\"Master! I have something else to discuss.\"\nIn truth, I had only asked about the Divine Guardian because something felt off after hearing Jin Hayeon's story. My main point was something else.\n\"Do you remember those black beans we found as evidence?\"\n\"How could I forget? To ordinary people, it’s just a drink, but for some, it’s a poison that amplifies depression. It’s no different from poison to our Cult.\"\n\"Exactly. But conversely speaking, just as the poisonous mushroom acted as a medicine for Warrior Kwan, there are undoubtedly things that are poison but can also act as medicine.”\n\"What are you trying to say?\"\nMaster looked at me with expectant eyes, as if he had somewhat guessed my intentions.\nTo fulfill Master's expectations, and above all, for my future safety—\nDuring my time in the medical ward, whenever I wasn't unconscious, I had been diligently formulating a plan.\n\"Just like those black beans or poisonous mushrooms, there are foods or medicinal ingredients in the world that affect people’s minds. Therefore, we must establish an institution that researches such foods and herbs. Additionally, we should train specialized physicians to treat and counsel those suffering from the side effects of Demonic Arts.\"\nIt was, in essence, a proposal to establish a psychiatric ward within the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 48 : Medical Ward (3)",
    "content": "Chapter 48: Medical Ward (3)\n\"Researching food and herbs, and training physicians?\"\nAs Master summarized my words and asked for confirmation, I nodded and replied.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"I can vaguely understand researching food and medicinal ingredients, but is counseling something that requires research as well?\"\n“What about Eldest Senior Brother's enlightenment or the incident with Third Brother?”\n\"Are you referring to the conversations you had with Jin-hak and Wan-pyeong?\"\n\"Yes. And I had completely different conversations with both seniors. Even though it’s the same counseling, it’s better for the counseling to be conducted differently depending on the symptoms of the side effects.\"\n\"Hmm... I think I understand what you mean.\"\nAlthough mental illnesses are often lumped together, the symptoms vary widely. And depending on the person or the symptoms, the counseling approach needs to be different.\nMoreover.\n\"Leaving aside the side effects of our Demonic Arts. Let’s take an example from what the common people have known as ‘fire illness’. It’s a disease that erupts from suppressing and accumulating anger and resentment, right? If the patient of that disease has somewhere to express their hardship and anger, it could help them to manage their emotions.”\nThis was also something I had heard from Lee Ji Yeon, who had helped me recall my memories of coffee.\nAfter being diagnosed with depression due to unreasonable complaints from citizens, she had completely turned into a fighter who would lash out at the slightest provocation from complainants. Just like when she argued with the citizen who stabbed me that day.\nAnd according to her post-transformation self, she had realized the truth thanks to counseling with a psychiatrist.\nSuffering alone in silence only hurts oneself. One must fight back against those who cause pain to prevent resentment from building up.\nWasn't there a folktale about the king having donkey ears? Simply keeping something bottled up can lead to mental illness, and that mental illness can develop to the point of destroying the body.\nOf course, I couldn’t bring up that folktale out loud to avoid unnecessary suspicion.\nIn any case, what mattered here was the act of \"speaking\" itself.\n\"People's minds become much more at ease just by telling someone about the problems that are bothering them. The issue is when the content is something that’s difficult to share with just anyone.\"\nJust like in the folktale about the king with donkey ears.\n\"That's why the newly trained physicians must serve as confidants while being medical practitioners. A safe outlet where one's secrets won't be spread elsewhere.\"\nUnlike the bamboo field in the folk tale, we needed people who would protect secrets.\n\"And based on what the physicians hear and record from counseling sessions and patient stories, we can improve counseling methods and treatment plans. The content should be restricted so that only the physicians of the new medical division and the cult leader can access it.\"\nAfter listening to my explanation silently, Master frowned and replied.\n“You are right, there is such an illness among the common people. Such people might indeed need counseling or a confidential outlet, as you said. However, it doesn’t seem to fit the warriors of our Cult. Above all, I believe relying on medicine might weaken the warriors of our Cult.”\nIt was a conclusion that reeked of old-fashioned stubbornness—that one must overcome everything with mental strength.\nAfter pondering how to respond to Master’s conclusion, I decided to take a bold approach.\n\"What has the cult achieved by adhering to this traditional method, Master? We were driven out of the Central Plains two hundred years ago and remain in hiding to this day.\"\nAs soon as my words ended, a terrifying demonic energy erupted from Master.\nIt was completely different from our earlier sparring match.\n\"What did you just say?\"\nDespite the absence of killing intent, the pressure of the energy was so strong that it was difficult to breathe.\nEven though I was already exhausted from the earlier sparring, and it felt like I might faint at any moment, I couldn’t stop speaking.\n\"If two hundred years of tradition haven't brought change, there's only one solution: to create change, Master.\"\n\"And you believe this change you propose will revive our Cult?\"\n\"I can't guarantee revival, but if we increase the number of medicines and physicians that help with side effects, the number of warriors will increase. Wouldn't that greatly aid our return to the Central Plains?\"\n\"Quality surpasses quantity in martial arts. One exceptional master who overcomes the side effects is more valuable than a hundred weak warriors who succumb to them.\"\n\"Isn’t it obvious that the chance of producing one supreme master is higher among those who had succumbed to their side effects?”\nAfter my final statement, Master didn’t respond but instead continued to press me with his menacing energy.\nEven as my head spun and I felt like I might collapse at any moment, I gritted my teeth and endured Master's energy and gaze.\nAnd just as I was about to faint from the unbearable pressure—\nSuddenly, the pressure bearing down on me vanished like a spring breeze.\n\"I understand your noble intention to develop our Cult. As you said, I think your opinion is correct that there can be no progress by simply following the past.\"\nAs the terrifying demonic energy dissipated, I almost chuckled.\n'Noble intentions my ass.'\nIt wasn’t out of pity for those suffering from side effects or a desire for the Cult’s development.\nThe biggest reason I came up with the idea of a psychiatric ward in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult was simple.\nIt was for my own mental health.\n'Having witnessed what happened to Kwan Mu-yeol, whose side effects were similar to mine, how could I just ignore it?'\nI don’t want to live the life of a crackhead.\nEspecially after my realm skyrocketed again due to Jang Hwi’s ambush, that worry had grown even more.\nThe concern that I might truly become a madman consumed by side effects becomes increasingly real with each passing moment.\nTherefore, the mental ward plan was insurance for my future.\nI realized that I needed to cultivate medicine and train physicians who could treat me if the side effects became unbearably strong.\nUnaware of my true intentions, Master seemed to have made some internal decisions and made an outrageous proposal.\n\"Then, how about you taking charge of this new medical division? You've experience in alleviating Jin-hak and Wan-pyeong's side effects through counseling, and as shown with the Black Bean Demon Tea and other instances, you seem to have some knowledge of food and medicine as well. You’d be perfect for the role.\"\n\"My ability to help my two senior brothers was merely a fluke. Additionally, my knowledge is limited to a few teas and foods, including black beans. I know practically nothing about medicinal herbs.\"\nThis old man was out of his mind. ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ NoveI-Fire.ɴet\nI knew a few common facts because I came from the modern era, but I was a civil servant, not a psychiatrist.\nI was a complete layman in psychiatry, which was precisely why I was advocating for the creation and development of a psychiatric ward.\nAfter all, I lacked the knowledge to cure my future self.\nInstead, having studied public administration, this kind of work was more suited to my aptitude.\nWhile I couldn't become a physician, establishing a system to train physicians was something I could do.\n\"First, we need to select a few people from the current medical division who can research medicinal herbs and counseling techniques, and then establish a system. I'll share with them the conversations I had with Eldest Brother and Third Brother, as well as the information I know about teas and foods. Furthermore, we should collect medical texts and folk remedies from the Central Plains and foreign lands, use them as a basis to find medicinal ingredients and foods that can stabilize the mind and body, and then test them.\"\n\"By test, do you mean feeding someone these herbs and foods?\"\n\"If we start with small amounts and gradually observe the effects, there shouldn't be major issues. Since we're conducting tests based on medical texts and folk knowledge, there should be few cases where consuming small amounts causes significant issues. Besides, there's also the case of Kwan Mu-yeol.\"\nKwan Mu-yeol had been secretly using poisonous mushrooms as a remedy.\nFrom the perspective of someone planning to build a mental ward, it could be considered an excellent success case.\n\"Hmm. It might not be a bad idea to reassign Kwan Mu-yeol from the Sacred Order to this new medical division and have him receive 'various' treatments.\"\n\"That... that seems like a good plan.\"\nKwan Mu-yeol had instantly become a lab rat.\nI felt a bit sorry for him, but I also thought it was for the best.\nIt wasn’t that I was glad he’d be a lab rat for me. I’m not that much of a scumbag.\n'He's already almost consumed by the side effects. Prioritizing treatment over training or duties would be better for Warrior Kwan. Yeah.'\nHaving quickly justified my thoughts, I swiftly changed the subject.\n\"As for additional physician training, how about selecting people currently receiving education in various parts of Xinjiang?\"\n\"Hmm. Weren't we planning to train talented children as warriors? It would be too time-consuming to teach them about medicinal ingredients, food, and counseling on top of martial arts. Moreover, what if they collapse under the side effects of Demonic Arts? Wouldn't that create an even bigger problem?\"\nIf a psychiatrist suffers from mental illness, it could be disastrous for patients. From that perspective, Master's point was valid.\nHowever, the ‘children’ I was referring to weren’t those children.\n\"During the two-year basic education program, there will be children who are smart but lack talent in martial arts.\"\n\"!!!”\n“You mean to raise children talented in martial arts as warriors, and intelligent children as physicians!\"\n\"They don't necessarily have to be raised as physicians. It would be good to divide them broadly into two groups: one learning medicine and the other learning administrative work.\"\nMaster, initially impressed, then frowned.\n\"If we entrust administrative work to them as well, wouldn't that weaken the position of warriors who have learned Demonic Arts? Our Heavenly Demon Divine Cult is a group that values martial arts in accordance with our doctrine. In the end, martial arts are necessary to punish evil.\"\nAt Master’s remark, my mind raced, and I quickly responded.\n\"It should be fine if we put those who have achieved Transcendence as the heads of each hall or department, just like now. Experts can hold leadership positions, while these new recruits can handle the practical work as subordinates.\"\nAfter that, I continued to discuss the draft of the psychiatric ward with Master without pause.\nWhile I had already planned some of it, my mind didn’t falter even under Master’s sharp questions.\nIt wasn't because I was a genius.\n—It’s still lacking!! Think of a more concrete plan!\n—And? What if something goes wrong? What’s your plan?\nIt was because the side effects, which had calmed down a bit thanks to the grueling training, came flooding back like a tide.\n'Talk about irony. Damn it.'\nI had come up with the idea of a psychiatric ward to prepare for the possibility of going insane from the side effects. Still, thanks to the side effect, a more systematic plan for the psychiatric ward was being created.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 49 : Punishment (1)",
    "content": "Chapter 49: Punishment (1)\nAfter nearly two hours of discussing the psychiatric ward, Master left Windrock Palace to attend to other matters.\nThe sky had already darkened by then, and I collapsed right after receiving a bath and massage treatment from Jin Hayeon.\nFrom sparring with Master to his not-so-subtle threats, and then continuously refining the plan for building the psychiatric ward while battling the side effects, I had exhausted my mental energy.\nFor the first time in a while, I fell asleep without being plagued by the side effects.\n'Ah... I've been knocked out and sleeping for the past few days.' The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the novel※fire.net\nThis thought crossed my mind as soon as I opened my eyes.\nI had been continuously knocked unconscious by Jin Hayeon while in the medical ward.\nRemembering that, I turned my head to the side and saw that Jin Hayeon’s bedding had already been tidied up.\n'It feels like I just closed my eyes for a moment, but a whole day has already passed.'\nFeeling a sense of emptiness, I was tidying up the blanket when I heard footsteps outside.\n‘What’s going on?’\nJin Hayeon wouldn’t normally make such loud footsteps.\nAs expected, the owner of the footsteps wasn’t Jin Hayeon.\n\"Big Brother!!\"\nThe door flung open, and a little girl with a face full of mixed emotions appeared.\nA Seon-ah-shaped missile launched herself into my arms.\nI patted the head of the little girl, who looked like a drenched kitten, and said, “I’m sorry for making you worry.\"\nSeon-ah looked up at me with teary eyes, as if she was about to cry.\n\"I'm fine now, so don't worry.\"\n\"I'll kill everyone who bullies Big Brother!\"\n\"Don't... What?\"\nWhat kind of kid says something like that?\n'How do those Hyeokyeon Family bastards raise their children?'\nThen again, I'm the fool for expecting anything from those fanatical psychopaths.\nLetting out a deep sigh, I scolded the little girl.\nNo! You can't just kill everyone. You shouldn't have such dangerous thoughts.\"\n\"But...\"\n\"Seon-ah, you're still young.\"\n\"There are bad people targeting Big Brother! And we learn martial arts to kill bad people, right?\"\nHow shocking! The little one who used to follow me so obediently was now talking back.\nBut the child's words were somewhat correct. I wasn't surprised at her talk of killing people either.\n\"That's why I'm saying you're too young. Many of those targeting me are master martial artists. If you try to kill them now, you might end up getting killed instead. That’s why it’s dangerous.\"\nUnable to counter my argument, Seon-ah hung her head dejectedly.\nFeeling a bit soft-hearted, I decided to offer a carrot instead of a stick.\n\"Still, it's nice to see that our Seon-ah is so diligent.\"\nAt my praise, the little one slightly raised her lowered head to look at me. I smiled and continued, \"You must have been worried when you heard I was hurt, but you diligently continued your training. You held back until today.\"\nDuring my recovery period in the medical ward, I hadn’t seen Seon-ah once. That meant she had been holding back her desire to visit me and focusing on her training.\n'Well, it seems she couldn't hold back anymore today.'\nSeeing her come early in the morning rather than her usual afternoon visits suggested she had reached her limit of patience.\nBut for some reason, the little one turned her head slightly at my praise, avoiding my gaze.\n\"???\"\nWhile I was puzzled, Jin Hayeon entered with breakfast through the door Seon-ah had left open.\nUpon noticing Seon-ah beside me, she spoke in her blunt tone, \"You've come again?\"\n\"...Again?\"\nAs I questioned this, Jin Hayeon set down my breakfast in front of me and said, \"She’s been coming every day while you were in the hospital ward. I simply didn't wake you for the sake of your rest.\"\n\"I don’t think I’ve seen her during meals, though?\"\n\"They chased me away when I came during meal times, saying I'd disturb Big Brother’s rest.\"\nSeon-ah pouted and confessed.\nWhile it was cute, it wasn’t something I could just let slide.\nSpoiling a child just because they’re cute is a surefire way to ruin their future.\n\"Seon-ah, you should keep your promises.\"\n\"I, I am! I finished all the training Auntie told me to do before coming!\"\nBefore I could ask Seon-ah more questions, Jin Hayeon unexpectedly came up in the child's defense.\n\"It’s probably true.\"\nAlthough the premise ‘likely’ was attached.\nIntrigued by Jin Ha-yeon's unexpected support, I glanced at her. She elaborated, \"The fact that the Hyeokyeon Family hasn't said anything to you so far means that the young lady's training has gone smoothly.\"\nI couldn't help but agree with her explanation.\nIndeed, they were the kind of people who would barge in just because I played with the kid a little. The fact that they’ve been quiet so far means there’s no problem.\n\"Since time is running out, perhaps you should have breakfast first, Young Master.\"\nAs expected of Jin Hayeon the Drillmaster, she urged me to eat as if the time I wasted was her lifespan.\nBut the day didn’t go as she hoped.\nJust as I finished breakfast with the little girl who had come early in the morning, two more guests arrived at Windrock Palace.\n\"Hahaha! How’s your body, Young Master?\"\n\"Youngest, how are you feeling?\"\nThis time, it was the positive-negative duo—Ouyang Mun and Third Brother.\n\"Thanks to resting well in the medical ward, my body is fine. By the way, what is that bundle in your hand, Young Warrior Ouyang?”\nDid he have prepared another bundle of gifts for Jin Hayeon?\nUnfortunately, my assumption was wrong. He had something far more troublesome in mind.\n\"Hahaha. Actually, I'll be staying here for a while, Young Master.\"\n\"...Staying here? What do you mean staying here?\"\nThird Brother answered my question on his behalf.\n\"Due to the recent incident, Master was concerned about your safety, so I recommended Young Warrior Ouyang here. He's been expressing his desire to become your guard for days now, and I thought he was someone we could trust.\"\nAs he said this, Third Brother glanced at Ouyang Mun, and the two shared a brief smile before quickly straightening their faces.\nIt seemed they had already become close brothers.\nThird Brother, now the older brother, had gone so far as to involve Master to get his love-struck younger brother assigned as my guard.\nAnd I knew exactly why he was so desperate to become my guard.\n\"...Are you that worried about Miss Jin sharing a room with me?\"\n\"W-w-what are you talking about, Young Master! I was just c-concerned because I heard you were attacked again...\"\n\"That sounds like you don't trust me as his guard.\"\nOuyang Mun floundered under Jin Hayeon's cold stare.\n\"N-no, that's not it...\"\nFeeling sorry for his flustered younger brother, Third Brother stepped forward and said, “It’s a misunderstanding, Miss Jin. I’m the one who recommended Young Warrior Ouyang. Even with Miss Jin present, how could one person handle the guard duty that was previously divided among three?\"\nUnable to direct her anger at Third Brother, Jin Hayeon responded with her characteristically indifferent expression.\n\"I understand, Third Young Master.\"\nAnd I had nothing more to say either.\n'If I say anything more here, Third Brother might fall into his paranoia again.'\nIf he went on a rampage, claiming he was being belittled, I might end up staring at the ceiling in the hospital ward again.\nBesides, I felt a little sorry for him too.\n'The fact that the woman you have a crush on is sharing a room with another man is enough to drive anyone crazy.’\nThough the fact that the other man was me was a bit of a problem.\nAfter some minor bickering, Ouyang Mun ended up unpacking his belongings in my room.\nAround that time, Eldest Brother, Hang Geon, and Sixth Brother who suffered from schizophrenia also visited, making the Windrock Palace quite lively for a while.\n\"Young master has a lot of studying to catch up on today. Please leave now.\"\nThanks to Jin Hayeon's cold dismissal, everyone soon left the Windrock Palace except for Ouyang Mun.\nAfter that, things proceeded much like usual, aside from a change in the order.\nSince I had guests in the morning, I started studying and martial arts training in the afternoon. Then, right on schedule, Master visited, and we conducted our usual sparring matches.\nIn other words, I struggled desperately to survive amid the terrible killing intent and demonic energy.\nAfter Master left, I did some light training on my own, followed by a bath and a massage.\nThis time, it was Ouyang Mun who took care of it instead of Jin Hayeon.\nIt felt strange.\n'He really is good at his job, I must say.'\nAlthough it felt awkward receiving a bath and massage from a man, he was certainly efficient.\nIt made me wonder how someone so competent could lose his mind over Jin Hayeon.\nAnd that night.\nBy chance, I ended up sharing a room with a lovesick patient, and I asked him, “How did you fall so hard for her?\"\nTo be honest, I was asking because I wondered if it was the side effect of his Demonic Arts.\nAt my question, Ouyang Mun quickly looked around to make sure no one was nearby and let out a sigh of relief.\nThen, with a nostalgic expression, he began to speak.\n\"I first met her on the day I entered Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\nAnd so began Ouyang Mun’s long, detailed story of his unrequited love.\nFrom the first time they met at the Hall of the Demonic Way to the various situations they faced together as fellow disciples.\n\"Contrary to her cold and haughty appearance, Hayeon was a passionate person, Young Master. She always trained until late at night and fiercely competed with me for the top seat.\"\n\"But she never wanted to depend on anyone. She always tried to stand on her own two feet. How should I put it? She appeared strong on the outside, but when you look closely, she seems fragile, which makes her seem even more pitiful.\"\n\"So I occasionally offered a helping hand, but each time she refused and chose to stand on her own, and that dignified appearance was as beautiful as a noble crane.\"\nAfter listening to his endless praise of Jin Hayeon for a while, I found myself tuning out the story.\nIt wasn't simply because it was boring. It was because I'd gotten the gist of it.\n'What? So you just fell for her face at first sight?'\nThe story started with him being struck by her beautiful face when they first met.\nWhat followed was even more ridiculous.\nIf Jin Hayeon did something, he found it pretty and liked it. If she did something else, he found it haughty and liked that too. It was as if he had liked her first and then came up with reasons afterward.\n\"Ahem. That's enough. I understand Young Warrior Ouyang's feelings well.\"\n\"There’s still a lot more to the story, Young Master.\"\n\"I have matters to attend to tomorrow, so I'll sleep now.\"\nListening to his rambling would be pointless, so I simply turned my back on him.\nI thought it was the side effect of his Demonic Art, but it turned out to be just the typical first crush of a lifelong bachelor.\nThe next morning.\nUnlike yesterday, after breakfast, I began my morning studies with Jin Hayeon as usual.\nIt was time to review the doctrinal texts, historical records, and law books that I had already studied once before.\nWhile I was focused on reading, I glanced toward the door to make sure it was closed, then turned to Jin Hayeon.\n\"Miss Jin, may I ask you something?\"\n\"Please do.\"\n\"Why do you dislike Young Warrior Ouyang so much?\"\nMaybe it was because of what I heard from Ouyang Mun last night, but I was curious.\nNot that I cared much whether Ouyang Mun’s love succeeded or failed. Just that...\n'Come to think of it, it feels less like Jin Hayeon is uninterested in Ouyang Mun and more like she outright dislikes him.'\nIt wasn’t very noticeable because Jin Hayeon rarely showed any emotional fluctuations.\nI hadn't paid much attention before either. It was something I realized belatedly thanks to yesterday's events.\n\"It’s study time now, Young Master. Please ask questions relevant to your studies.\"\n\"I don’t particularly want to meddle either, but since we’ll be living together for a while, it’s uncomfortable for me if the two of you don’t get along.\"\nPerhaps because the person she was supposed to serve was experiencing discomfort because of her, or perhaps due to her strong sense of responsibility, Jin Hayeon let out a faint sigh and opened her mouth.\n\"I disliked him from the beginning.\"\nAnd so began a story that would likely reduce Ouyang Mun to tears.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 50 : Punishment (2)",
    "content": "Chapter 50: Punishment (2)\nJin Hayeon. She was the eldest daughter of an ordinary family.\nOf course, by the standards of the Demonic Cult, “ordinary” meant her parents were low-level martial artists without much talent in martial arts.\nThey rarely had reason to visit the main headquarters and were low-ranking martial artists working at a branch in a quiet village.\nIf there was anything unusual about them, it might be that although their martial arts skills and understanding were average, they were fairly good-looking parents.\nUnder such parents, Jin Hayeon's birth was nothing short of a miracle.\nSetting aside her striking appearance, her talent in martial arts and her intelligence were both exceptional.\nIn her village, she was known as a \"genius,\" and all the villagers congratulated her parents. She was the pride of her parents, the pride of the branch they belonged to, and the beloved daughter of the entire village.\nAnd fortunately, though her parents were ordinary as individuals, they were excellent as parents. That is to say, they were excellent by the standards of the Demonic Cult.\nFrom a young age, Jin Ha-yeon’s parents raised her according to the teachings of the cult. She could have grown arrogant or spoiled from too much affection, but being raised with the doctrines, she became a devout believer.\n\"When I grow up, I'll definitely become a great person who contributes to the Divine Cult!\"\nThis was what she used to say habitually before falling asleep every night after studying the cult's scriptures with her parents during her childhood.\n—Hohoho. I believe Hayeon will definitely accomplish that.\n— Of course! She's smart and takes such good care of her siblings. Where else could you find a child as good as our Hayeon?\nAs the eldest daughter, she often looked after her younger siblings when her parents were busy with branch duties. And when her siblings took naps, she would clean in place of her parents or follow them to help those in need in the village.\nAfter her parents finished their branch duties, they would teach her martial arts. Of course, as low-level martial artists, their techniques weren’t particularly powerful, so she never suffered severe side effects.\nBy the time she turned fifteen, she had already caught up with her parents' achievements and told them,\n—I want to enter the Hall of the Demonic Way!\nHaving been praised as a genius by everyone in the village, she was confident. But she wasn't arrogant.\n—After completing the Hall of the Demonic Way, I want to help people who are struggling!\nAlthough her statement omitted the phrase \"by killing bad guys with Demonic Arts,\" her parents understood her meaning.\nIt was a natural statement in the Demonic Cult.\nThose with great power punished evildoers who oppressed the weak. This is why the Demonic Cult revered martial arts.\nEven at the risk of developing mental illness.\nThe Demonic Cult even considered this a noble mindset. And her parents, as martial artists of the Cult, supported her decision.\nEventually, at sixteen, she took the entrance exam for the Hall of the Demonic Way and passed with flying colors.\nAs the nineteenth out of twenty.\nIt was the first shock in her life.\nShe, who had been praised as a genius by everyone in her village, was at the bottom of the rankings at the academy.\nThat day, she realized she was a frog in a well.\nBut she didn't give up.\n'Right. Everyone except me is from the main headquarters! They’ve just had access to better martial arts from the start!'\nThe Hall of the Demonic Way, which trained the future of the Cult, openly taught all martial arts except for the Heavenly Demon Divine Technique and the techniques of the Five Great Families.\nSo, she believed that if she could just master the highest-level Demonic Arts, she would be able to catch up to them. The question was which Demonic Art to choose.\nWhile pondering this dilemma, a young man named Ouyang Mun approached her. Just as Ouyang Mun had fallen for her appearance at first sight, Jin Hayeon was also aware of Ouyang Mun's existence.\nThe boy who had ranked first in the entrance exam.\nSo, her impression of Ouyang Mun was: ‘A spoiled brat born with a silver spoon in his mouth.'\nShe didn't like it.\nIn the village where she was born, there were many people who lived difficult lives. That's why the warriors of the branch would help the villagers, and she too would follow her parents to help the village elders.\nWhile she spent her time helping others, he had lived a comfortable life focused solely on training and studying.\n'According to the doctrine, I acted righteously, so why...'\nOblivious to her thoughts— ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ novel⸺fire.net\n—Ahem. Need any help?\nHe casually spoke to Jin Hayeon who was immersed in her lone training.\n—No need. I can do it myself.\nEven at her caustic words, that guy kept talking to her whenever he had a chance.\nFrom then on, she focused on the Hall’s curriculum, debating which martial art to pursue.\n—Ahem. You're supposed to do it like this. See? Easy, right? You try it too.\nOuyang Mun would always approach her casually and give advice as if it were nothing.\nShe was angry. Angry that while she was struggling to keep up with the academy's lessons, that guy was accomplishing them as if they were nothing.\nTrue to her devout nature, she turned to the Cult’s scriptures when her emotions wavered.\nShe believed the truth was there.\nAnd the scriptures didn't betray her faith.\n‘Truly, all humans are inherently evil. And that includes me...'\nShe finally realized what she was feeling.\nEmotions she had never felt while living in the village.\nJealousy and envy.\nShe felt disgusted with herself.\nAnd sure enough, the answer was written in the scriptures.\nAll humans are inherently evil and the one who judged and watched over that evil was the Heavenly Demon.\n'Heavenly Demon, please save me.'\nAs she confessed her wicked thoughts to the Heavenly Demon, she had an epiphany.\n'That's right. Since the human heart is inherently corrupt, I must abandon my emotions.'\nThis was why she chose the White Hand Demonic Art even after knowing that she would slowly lose her compassion and empathy.\n'Even without emotions, acting according to the scriptures will lead me to save others.'\nInstead of clinging to human emotions that are filled with malice, she decided to entrust her judgment entirely to the scriptures.\nAfter she started learning the White Hand Demonic Art, her skills grew rapidly.\nShe, who had been ranked nineteenth out of twenty and belonged to the bottom class, was able to enter the top class shortly after learning the White Hand Demonic Art.\nShe had proven that she was not inferior to those from the headquarters; they had simply had an easier start.\nExcept for one person.\nNo matter how hard she tried, she couldn't take first place.\nFirst place was always Ouyang Mun's.\n—Hmm, this won’t do, I’ll be caught up if I don’t work hard at this rate.\n—If it’s at this level, you definitely can do it right?\nHe acted as if he were a rival in a friendly competition, casually giving her advice even when she didn’t want it. For Jin Hayeon who hadn’t mastered her Demonic Art at that time, she found his attitude to be truly infuriating.\n'I'm giving it my all, yet he's so relaxed, even finding time to patronize me while outperforming me.'\nBut what angered her most wasn't about grades.\n'Why do you keep trying to help me! Why!'\nShe wanted to become a great person who contributed to the Cult. She had entered the academy to help others. But that guy kept treating her like a helpless child.\nThus, she forced herself to endure Ouyang Mun’s needless meddling throughout her year in the academy.\nShe suppressed her anger and jealousy toward him and channeled them into her training.\nShe wanted to surpass him and change his condescending attitude.\nShe wanted to prove that she was a full-fledged martial artist.\nBut in the end, she never managed to take first place from Ouyang Mun.\nTherefore, after completing the academy, she headed to the Dark Shadow Pavilion. To fulfill her childhood goal of being someone who helps others, not someone who receives help. But after two years of struggle, she realized that she lacked the talent to reach the top.\nSo, she decided to dedicate herself to serving the Heavenly Demon.\nWhen Jin Hayeon's finished her explanation, Il-mok momentarily lost his words.\nNot that Jin Hayeon had shared every detail. She hadn’t mentioned her childhood or the jealousy and envy she felt toward Ouyang Mun.\nJust—\n\"At first, I didn't like him because I thought he was a spoiled brat born with a silver spoon in his mouth.”\n\"I hated how he kept trying to help me. It felt like he was looking down on me.\" She only briefly explained why she disliked Ouyang Mun.\nBut Il-mok, with a mental age in his mid-thirties, could grasp the situation roughly.\n'Ouyang Mun... I think you're out of luck.'\nHe had noticed to some extent before, that Jin Hayeon was a woman with a strong sense of independence. She preferred to help others rather than receive help.\nThe modern-era analogy was like a rich boy casually throwing expensive gifts at a woman striving to make it on her own and acting as if the gifts were nothing.\nFrom Jin Hayeon's perspective, that attitude might have felt like he was mocking her.\n'Things might have been different if their circumstances were similar. And to think he's a direct descendant of the Ouyang Clan.'\nIn fact, this was the most surprising part of Jin Hayeon's story.\nThe Ouyang Family—like the Hyeokryeon Family—is one of the Five Great Families of the Demonic Cult, known as the five pillars of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nHaving spent over six months in the cult, Il-mok knew of their existence.\nIt's just that—\n‘Considering how he’s been acting like a fool around Jin Hayeon, I thought he was just a branch family member.'\nHe couldn’t believe one of the Five Great Families would let him act like this.\nWell, after asking Jin Hayeon more, he learned that although he was a direct descendant, he wasn't the eldest son, so he seemed to live quite freely.\nFar from being the eldest son, he was apparently the youngest son of the current family head.\nIt was a classic tale of a chaebol's youngest son pursuing a hardworking, beautiful commoner and getting utterly rejected.\n'This is like a morning drama.'\nFrom a bystander’s perspective, it was truly an entertaining spectacle.\nThat night.\nAs he shared his room with Ouyang Mun again, Il-mok hesitated for a moment before calling out to Ouyang Mun.\n\"Young Warrior Ouyang.\"\n\"Yes, Young Master!\"\n\"Actually, I had a brief conversation with Miss Jin this morning.\"\n\"...What kind of conversation?\"\n\"A conversation about Young Warrior Ouyang.\"\n\"!! D-Did you tell Hayeon about my feelings for her!?\"\nAs Ouyang Mun was about to have a panic attack, Il-mok quickly added, \"I just asked why she dislikes Young Warrior Ouyang so much, so don't worry!\"\n\"...Hayeon dislikes me?\" Ouyang Mun's face turned pale like someone who had suffered a serious internal injury.\n\"...Hasn’t she always been cold to you?\"\n\"I thought she was just shy...\"\n\"......\"\nAt a loss for words, Il-mok sighed once and said, \"There seems to be a bit of a misunderstanding between you two, that's why I'm telling you this.\"\nIl-mok carefully recounted what Jin Ha-yeon had said while omitting some things so that the poor guy wouldn’t cough up blood from internal injury.\n\"Try to not meddle in her affairs too much. She takes pride in doing her share on her own. The more you try to help, the more you’ll upset her, especially since you are the direct descendant of the Ouyang Family.”\n\"Then, how am I supposed to express my feelings without helping her?”\nNo, that's not it, don't convey them at all.\nThe words rose to Il-mok's throat, but he managed to hold them back and said, \"Don't help her, just watch and acknowledge her as a martial artist in her own right.\"\nAfter that, Il-mok continued to offer advice, and Ouyang Mun listened with a serious face. Just as Il-mok was about to sigh in relief that this guy was listening to his words,\nOuyang Mun suddenly got up and left the room.\n\"...Young Warrior Ouyang?\"\nFeeling an inexplicable sense of foreboding, only to stop and facepalm in the hallway.\n\"Hayeon!!\"\nWhy do you ask?\nBecause this fucking madman had run to Jin Hayeon's quarters in the middle of the night and was calling out to her.\nSwoosh.\n\"What do you want?\"\nFacing Jin Hayeon, who had opened the door with a cold expression, Ouyang Mun shouted, \"I heard from Young Master Ilmok. About why you dislike me.\"\nIl-mok, who had been facepalming his face, unwittingly groaned, \"Please. Gods above. Just kill me.\"\nHe wanted to knock Ouyang Mun unconscious and drag him away, but Jin Hayeon’s icy gaze made him quickly lower his head.\nUndeterred, Guyang Mun declared with uncharacteristic seriousness, \"It was all your misunderstanding. I didn't try to help you because I thought you were pitiful or inferior to me!\"\n\"Then why did you?\"\nJin Hayeon’s face grew even colder than usual, yet, Ouyang Mun declared boldly, \"Because I love you!\"\nIl-mok, who had been trying to find a hole to bury his head from embarrassment, looked up and widened his eyes.\n“Crazy bastard.” The words escaped his mouth before his brain could catch up.\nConfessing his love was one thing, but this was the worst possible time and place.\nUnaware of Il-mok’s embarrassment, Ouyang Mun continued his attack. He told her how he had fallen for her at first sight, how he had approached her to help because of his love.\nHe went on and on, trying to clear up her misunderstanding.\nYet, for some reason, the more Ouyang mun spoke, the more flushed Jin Hayeon’s face became.\n\"So, you’ve been doing that because you like me?\"\nMistaking her blush for reciprocation, Ouyang Mun delivered his final blow.\n\"Yes. It was all a misunderstanding! I'll do anything for you. I'd even leave my family if it's for you.”\nAnd as soon as he finished.\n\"Cough.\"\nJin Hayeon coughed up blood.\nHer flushed face wasn't from embarrassment or affection. It was a prelude to Qi Deviation.",

    "content": "Chapter 51: Foundation (1)\n\"!?\"\nIgnoring their shock, Jin Hayeon immediately sat in a lotus position and began to regulate her breathing.\nShe needed to control the demonic energy of the White Hand Demonic Art that went berserk due to the sudden change in her emotions.\nThe catalyst for her near descent into Qi Deviation was rage.\nTo think he had been acting that way toward her because of something as trivial as love. It felt as if all her hard work had been reduced to nothing because of her appearance. She felt utterly humiliated.\nAnd he even has the audacity to say that he will forsake his family for her?\nAs a member of one of the Five Great Families that led the Demonic Cult, his lack of concern for saving the suffering masses was utterly pathetic.\nThat's why the fragments of emotions she had frozen deep inside had risen.\nSince her White Hand Demonic Art hadn’t yet reached the end of Extremity stage, she couldn’t completely eliminate her emotions. She had merely buried them deep and frozen them with the cold energy of her art.\nThose emotions had risen violently, making it difficult to bury and freeze them again.\nJin Hayeon, who had been trying to control the demonic energy and her emotions, came to this realization and made a decision.\nInstead of burying and freezing them, she would pull them out.\nShe gathered all the scattered fragments of her emotions.\nThe envy and jealousy she had felt toward Ouyang Mun since their days at the Hall of the Demonic Way. Even the small fragments of camaraderie that had formed over the past two years.\nTo that, she added the contempt and disgust toward Ouyang Mun that were boiling at this moment.\nShe contained all these emotions together with the cold energy of the White Hand Demonic Art. However, the mass was too large to be expelled through her meridians.\nSo, she pushed it out in a different direction.\n\"Cough.\"\nAfter spitting out a mouthful of rotten blood, she observed her internal state again.\nWith the intense emotions directed at Ouyang Mun gone, a semblance of calm returned.\nAmong what remained of them, what particularly caught her attention were her emotions toward Il-mok.\n'When did it become like this...?'\nCompared to her faith in the Heavenly Demon and the Cult—which were her greatest pillars—or the emotions she had just expelled regarding Ouyang Mun, these feelings were minuscule. Yet, they were now second only to her feelings for her parents.\nConsidering they had only been together for half a year, it was quite significant.\nShe wanted to examine exactly what these emotions were, but she had to quickly stabilize her internal energy first.\nHer Qi Deviation wasn’t over yet.\nThe moment Jin Hayeon, who had barely managed to control her rampaging internal energy, opened her eyes, pure white cold energy raged in her eyes before quickly receding.\nBy expelling the huge lump of emotions along with the rotten blood, she had overcome the Qi Deviation and broken through a barrier in her White Hand Demonic Art.\nThe first thing she saw with her newly elevated perception was the garden, now a mess of water and ice. It was a mess created by her rampaging demonic energy.\nStanding guard amidst that chaos were Ouyang Mun and Il-mok.\n\"Hayeon!\"\n\"Miss Jin. Are you alright?!\"\nThere wasn't any emotion left in her gaze as she looked at Ouyang Mun, who was looking at her with concern.\nRising to her feet, she said to Ouyang Mun.\n\"Thank you. Thanks to you, I no longer feel anything for you.\"\nWith that, she turned and walked into her quarters, closing the door behind her.\nFaced with her icy attitude, Ouyang Mun stood awkwardly, then turned around and asked.\n\"…What should I do now? Young Master.\"\n“…She said thank you, didn’t she? That’s enough for now, isn’t it?\"\n\"Is, is that so?\"\nOf course, it wasn't, but Il-mok couldn't bring himself to tell the truth.\nHe didn’t want to witness Qi Deviation twice in one day.\nThe next morning, Jin Hayeon conducted the lesson as usual, her demeanor as impassive as ever, as if nothing had happened the previous night. The source of this content ɪs novel⟡fire.net\nBecause of that, I felt like I was dying of discomfort.\nFinally, I couldn't stand it and spoke first.\n\"Ahem. I'm sorry about last night.\"\n\"I'm not bothered by it at all, so it's fine.\"\nHer emotionless answer somehow sounded scarier than a reprimand.\n\"Ahem. Since we're living together, I thought I'd try to ease the tension between the two of you a bit. I told Ouyang Mun to give you space and not to bother you.\"\nI tried my best to explain and clear up her misunderstanding.\nHonestly, I felt a bit wronged.\nI clearly told Ouyang Mun to keep his distance from her since she was in a bad mood. Who knows that this crazy bastard would misinterpret my advice and launch a confession attack?\n\"I'm truly fine, Young Master.\"\nStill maintaining her cold demeanor, Jin Hayeon added.\n“I no longer feel anything toward Ouyang Mun. Thanks to him, I’ve even advanced in my cultivation. Why would I be angry?”\n\"I, I see.\"\nI couldn’t tell if her coldness was due to her advancement or her suppressed anger.\nOnly one thing became clear:\n‘His love life is doomed.’\nIn love, nothing is more frightening than apathy.\nBut I couldn’t muster up any sympathy for Ouyang Mun.\nWhile the start was a misunderstanding, it was Ouyang Mun himself who had hammered the final nail in the coffin.\nThat afternoon.\nMaster who came as usual to give lessons glanced at Jin Hayeon and said, \"Oh. You've grown so much overnight that the phrase remarkable progress doesn’t do you justice.”\nAs expected of someone of his caliber, he immediately recognized Jin Hayeon’s achievement.\nIn response to Master’s praise, Jin Hayeon bowed deeply and humbly replied, “It’s all thanks to Young Master Il-mok and Ouyang Mun, Heavenly Demon.”\nWhen her lips mentioned my name, I couldn't help but flinch.\n‘She’s definitely angry....'\nThe words she said this morning seemed like lies.\nOuyang Mun, who had been unusually subdued today, also flinched.\nUnaware of the details, Master looked at me and muttered, “Hoh.”\n\"Hohoho. After Jin-hak and Wanpyeong, it's now Hayeon's turn. It seems everyone who spends time with you makes rapid progress.\"\n\"Ha. Hahaha. It's, it's just a coincidence.\"\nIt wasn't modesty.\nJin Hayeon's gaze was so scary that I didn't dare to boast.\nFortunately, the celebration for Jin Hayeon didn't last long.\n\"Since time is short, let's start training now.\"\nSaying so, heavy pressure emanated from Master the moment he drew his sword. And as usual, I was trashed like a dog throughout the entire training session.\n\"Huff. Huff.\"\nMaster’s vast and suffocating demonic energy paired with his killing intent made my hair stand on end. A single thought crossed my mind as I faced him.\n‘…Is he taking out the stress of being the Cult Leader on me?'\n“What are you thinking so deeply about?\"\n“Nothing, Master!\"\nWhat a sharp old fogey.\nAfter an hour of trashing disguised as combat training, I collapsed on the floor, gasping for breath.\n\"Huff. Huff.\"\nUnlike my dogshit appearance, Master hadn’t even broken a sweat and was still immaculate as usual. He looked down at me and said, “Clean yourself and come to the Heavenly Demon Palace. We have something to discuss.”\n\"T-This disciple understands. Huff.\"\nAfter Master left, I immediately received a bath and massage from Jin Hayeon.\n“Miss Jin? You seem… colder than usual...?\"\n“My apologies. My sudden advancement has made it difficult to control my strength.\"\n\"I, I see.\"\nIt didn’t seem like that was the reason, but I couldn't bring myself to question her.\nAfter cleaning myself, I headed to the Heavenly Demon Palace, with Jin Hayeon and Ouyang Mun by my sides.\n\"......\"\n\"......\"\nThe walk was excruciatingly silent.\nJin Hayeon coldly scanned our surroundings, while the usually talkative Ouyang Mun kept glancing at her, his mouth opening and closing without a word.\nHe looked like a puppy abandoned by its owner on a rainy day.\n'Come to think of it, if Ouyang Mun could be likened to a hyperactive but somewhat dumb puppy, then what of Jin Hayeon? An aloof and prickly cat?”\nWhile entertaining such trivial thoughts, we soon arrived at the Heavenly Demon Palace.\nAfter being escorted inside by the guards, we arrived at Master's residence.\n\"Come in. I figured you hadn’t eaten dinner yet, so I had a meal prepared for you. Let’s talk while we eat.\"\nI sighed inwardly at Master’s welcoming words.\n‘He’s going to talk work over food again.'\nThe thought made my stomach churn. I had a feeling I'd need to visit the kitchen for a late-night snack later.\n\"Sit.\"\n\"Yes, Master.\"\nAs soon as I sat down, Master got straight to the point.\n“I called you here to discuss the new medical ward you mentioned a few days ago. You’ll be in charge of setting up its system until you enter the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\nThis crazy old man was trying to dump the entire job on me.\n\"...The entrance exam for the Hall is less than six months away, Master. I’m worried it might interfere with my preparation.\"\nBut Master easily deflects my excuse.\n\"You don't need to worry about that.\"\nWas he going to use his authority as the Cult Leader to just put me in the Hall of the Demonic Way?\nBut that hope was quickly dashed.\n\"Your realm had skyrocketed after the recent attacks. Although your enlightenment has become blurry since you fainted after that, if you properly consolidate that enlightenment in the remaining time, your entry is as good as guaranteed.”\n\"B-But what if preparing the new infirmary hinders my training and prevents me from consolidating my enlightenment?\"\n“Hahaha, what’s to worry when this old man is your master? Until you fully consolidate your enlightenment, I’ll do my best to teach you.”\nIt meant he would thrash me like a dog, as he did today, or even worse.\nIf my skills didn’t grow?\nThen he would pressure me with more intense demonic energy and killing intent, and if that didn't work, he'd probably thrash me and start stabbing me with his sword for real.\nWhat’s worse, in this damned cult that reveres martial arts above all else, being stabbed by the Heavenly Demon would be considered a great favor.\n'Damned cult!'\nAlthough I was cursing out storms inside, outside, I had no choice but to show a face full of gratitude.\n“I don't know how to repay your grace, Master.\"\n“Hahaha. It’s only natural as your teacher, so don’t worry about it. Ah, I’ve been talking too long. Eat comfortably.\"\nAs Master kindly offered the food with a gentle smile, I moved my chopsticks to pick up a piece of meat and stuffed it into my mouth.\nBut just as I started eating, Master said, \"First, I've instructed the Cult’s members to collect and investigate medical texts and folk remedies, but it will inevitably take a long time. So, it’s best to start preparing for counseling first.\"\nLet me eat in peace!!!\nI quickly chewed and swallowed the meat in my mouth and replied, \"Then, as I mentioned before, should I inform the physicians about the conversations I had with Eldest Brother and Third Brother?\"\n\"In addition to that, tell the physicians about Hayeon as well. I've completed the selection of physicians who will work in the new medical ward, so I'll introduce them to you tomorrow.\"\nAnd so, I was forced to endure another hour of discussing the mental health ward while barely touching my food. At this rate, what I needed wasn’t a late-night snack, but digestive medicine instead.\nAfter the hour-long dinner meeting, Il-mok departed.\n“The First Squad Leader of the Hidden Guard Pavilion greets the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons.\"\nA woman in black stealth clothes appeared from the darkness.\n“Any unusual signs?\"\n\"There have been no suspicious movements so far.\"\nIl-mok, Ouyang Mun, and Jin Hayeon hadn't noticed at all, but she had been following them from Windrock Palace to here.\nIl-mok’s current situation was somewhat strange.\nDespite being an assassination target twice, he currently only has Jin Hayeon and Ouyang Mun as his official guards.\nBut those two are just a ruse to hide the true situation. In reality, the Heavenly Demon had assigned hidden guards from the Hidden Guard Pavilion to guard Il-mok.\nIn other words, the Heavenly Demon was using Il-mok as bait.\nHe wasn't the type to let his guard down just because a rat had committed suicide.\nNot after his disciple was targeted twice.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 52 : Foundation (2)",
    "content": "Chapter 52: Foundation (2)\nAfter listening to the First Squad Leader of the Shadowless Pavilion brief him on Il-mok’s situation, the Heavenly Demon stroked his beard.\n\"Hmm.\"\nSeemingly lost in thought, the Heavenly Demon asked.\n\"So, do you know why Jin Hayeon's cultivation has advanced so rapidly?\"\nIn response to that question, the First Squad Leader recounted what she had witnessed that night.\nAfter listening to her story, the Heavenly Demon smiled gently.\n\"Hehe. Youth.\"\nWhat was a traumatic experience for Ouyang Mun and Jin Hayeon was merely an amusing anecdote for the centuries-old Heavenly Demon. He viewed it with the same fondness one might have for the antics of young grandchildren.\n\"Hayeon's achievements are rising quickly, so you must have high expectations for her.\"\nThe previously rigid demeanor of the First Squad Leader softened at his words.\n\"It seems that child might become a person who serves the Lord well in the future.”\nHidden Guard Pavilion (隱衛閣).\nIt was an institution established to train Heavenly Demon's personal guards.\nTo train the Heavenly Demon’s personal guards, new recruits mostly learned menial tasks typically done by servants or maids before being assigned to serve the Heavenly Demon’s disciples or key figures in the Cult to gain experience.\nIt was through this process that Jin Hayeon had become Il-mok’s maid. As the second-ranked graduate of the Hall of the Demonic Way, she was a highly regarded talent within the Hidden Guard Pavilion. This stemmed from the unique nature of the pavilion itself.\nWhile serving the Heavenly Demon up close was a great honor, the fact that one had to handle all the menial tasks of a servant or maid was a problem.\nA big problem, in fact.\nHall of the Demonic Way serves as the collective pool of talented individuals within the cult. The main problem is that these talented individuals would not voluntarily humble themselves to handle mundane tasks that attendants and servants would normally handle, unless they have special reasons or circumstances. They generally prefer to work within the martial units, the Sacred Order, or the Law Enforcement Hall.\nEvery year, one or two graduates from the Hall of the Demonic Way were assigned to the Hidden Guard Pavilion, but more often than not, they were those who ranked at the bottom of the class of twenty graduates.\nIn other words, this is good news for the pavilion. However unintentionally, it doesn’t change the fact that Il-mok helped an already talented child further develop her talent.\nHowever, Heavenly Demon somehow shook his head at the Squad Leader’s words.\n\"Hahaha. I'm over a century old. By the time that child reaches your level, she will likely be serving the next generation's Heavenly Demon, not me.\"\n\"That is absolutely unthinkable. We will serve you with all our hearts.\"\n\"How can human effort defy the will of Heaven?\"\n\"Please punish us for our inadequacy.\"\nSeeing the Squad Leader prostrate herself in apology, the Heavenly Demon spoke with a pitying expression.\n“Enough. Go back to Il-mok now. Something might happen while you’re away.\"\nAs soon as the Heavenly Demon gave his solemn command, the woman hesitated momentarily before bowing deeply and disappearing into the shadows.\n“Long live the Heavenly Demon. Long live the Heavenly Demon. Long live the Heavenly Demon.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon gazed at the empty space where the First Squad Leader had been, then turned his gaze to open the window and look at the brightly shining moon.\n“Thanks to that child, I now look forward to my remaining days.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon had experienced almost everything a person could experience.\nSo much so that his current days had been merely a repetition of the same things.\nBut the presence of Il-mok had introduced small changes to his dull days.\nThinking of the child’s rapid growth and the gradual changes he brought to the cult made the Heavenly Demon look forward to the next day.\n\"How long has it been since I felt this kind of emotion?\"\nIt was just a pity that the day of departure was slowly approaching.\nThe next day, after breakfast, Il-mok set out with Jin Hayeon and Ouyang Mun.\nIt was a route Il-mok was well-acquainted with—the path from Windrock Palace to the medical hall.\nBut they weren't heading to the medical ward.\nThey were going to a manor located near the medical ward.\nAt the entrance of this estate, which had originally served a different purpose, hung a newly inscribed plaque.\nPure Mind Hall (正心院)\nA medical institute for purifying the mind.\nIl-mok referred to this place as the psychiatric ward, but he couldn’t officially use that name.\nThe person who welcomed Il-mok upon arriving at the ward was an elderly man whom Il-mok had met several times before.\n\"I greet the Demonic Physician.\"\nHe was the head of the medical ward at the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult’s headquarters and the old man who had examined and treated Il-mok several times when he was taken to the medical ward.\nThe elder replied to Il-mok’s greeting with a playful smile and exaggerated courtesy.\n\"On the contrary, it’s me who should pay my respects to the Master of the Pure Mind Hall.”\nAt the Demonic Physician's greeting, Il-mok smiled awkwardly.\n\"Master of the Pure Mind Hall? Please don’t be too excessive, I’ll only be here for a few months before I enter the Hall of the Demonic Way.”\n\"Hohoho. Then, Interim Master it is.\"\nIl-mok smiled wryly at the old man's persistent jokes. He was an unusually playful old man for a physician.\nFeeling that it would be tiresome to be swept along by the old man's jokes, Il-mok changed the subject.\n\"By the way, have you also been transferred to the Pure Mind Hall, elder?\"\n\"Hohoho. How could a physician not be interested in researching new treatments? So, please call me the Deputy Master from now on, Interim Master.\"\n\"Ah. I'll be leaving in a few months, so Elder Demonic Physician should take the Master position. I'll be satisfied as the Interim Deputy Master.\"\n“Hahaha. Is that so?\"\nThe Demonic Physician laughed playfully, then pointed to a pavilion and said.\n\"Oh my, look at me. I’ve kept you standing too long. When you get old, you tend to forget things, so please understand.\"\nAs soon as they entered the room, Il-mok took out a booklet he had prepared and placed it on the table.\n\"These are the details I organized last night regarding the operation of Pure Mind Hall.\"\nSince he couldn’t fall asleep thanks to his Master and the damned side effects of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, he focused his obsession on something else.\nIt was only after staying up all night drafting the plan for the psychiatric ward that he managed to sleep.\nFortunately, he had already worked out most of the framework during his two conversations with Heavenly Demon. If he’d had to start from scratch, he probably wouldn’t have finished even after staying up all night.\n\"Hohoho. I hear you're quite meticulous, Interim Deputy Master. To be honest, I was a bit worried since you were often brought here.\"\n\"Well, it wasn't my fault that I was brought in, was it?\"\n\"That's true. Hohoho.\"\nAfter exchanging light-hearted banter, the old man began reading the booklet Il-mok had handed, and before long, the mischievous glint within the old man’s eyes disappeared.\n'...This is beyond expectations.'\nIt wasn’t just a haphazard list of ideas but a truly systematic and well-organized plan.\nIt outlined strategies for acquiring medical texts from across the land, methods for research and experimentation, a framework for training new physicians, and, most importantly, a detailed system for conducting and documenting patient consultations.\nIt was a level of systematization that was hard to believe had been created by a fifteen-year-old youngster.\nAll thanks to the damn side effects of Demonic Arts.\nAs the Demonic Physician turned the final page and closed the booklet, Il-mok broke the silence.\n\"Obtaining medical texts and training physicians will require help from other institutes and will take a long time. Therefore, we should focus on organizing the consultation sessions first.\"\n“Heavenly Demon has already instructed the various departments and halls to prepare the necessary resources for the first two tasks. It seems appropriate to proceed with the consultations as Deputy Master suggested.\"\nThe Demonic Physician agreed with Il-mok and asked.\n\"Then, shall we proceed by gathering case studies first, as the Deputy Master suggested?\"\n\"To treat new patients, we need to develop treatment methods, which requires collecting and classifying case studies, correct?\"\n\"That's correct.\"\nEven from a physician's perspective, it was an entirely reasonable proposition.\n'Divide them according to the side effects of each Demonic Art, conduct counseling with those who have learned Demonic Arts, and meticulously document their experiences...'\nRecalling the contents of the booklet Il-mok had handed over, the Demonic Physician fell into deep thought.\nIn fact, there were many existing records detailing the side effects of Demonic Arts.\nIf there were no such records in the first place, it would not have been known what side effects each Demonic Art had.\nThe problem begins with the fact that although recorded, the records themselves were also disorganized. Moreover, these records primarily documented only the side effects. There were almost no records of how martial artists coped with these side effects, how they overcame them, or when they failed to overcome them and fell into madness.\nThe primary cause of this situation was that most practitioners passed down their experiences verbally to their disciples or family members rather than leaving written records.\nAnd the reason for that is even simpler.\nThey deemed their suffering from the side effects of their Demonic Arts as the shame of their life.\nIt’s not something they could easily share with others.\n\"While we can gather and organize the disorganized records, I don't know if the cult's martial artists will actively participate in counseling.\"\nBeing forced to dredge up such painful and humiliating memories could lead the patients to distort or conceal something out of embarrassment—creating opportunities for future, even greater, dangers.\nAt the Demonic Physician's concern, Il-mok responded as if it were no big deal.\n\"We can borrow Master's influence. How could anyone defy the stern command of the Heavenly Demon? Moreover, if Master and his disciples set an example, it will be difficult for others to refuse counseling.\"\nHe shamelessly tossed his Master’s prestige in the fray like it was nothing.\nSince his Master had dumped all this work onto him, he should at least let him borrow his name.\n\"Also, the more participants we have, the easier it will be to identify those who provide false information.\"\n“Hmm. You’re implying we shouldn’t unconditionally believe what those participating in the consultations tell us.\"\n“Most of these martial artists are suffering under the miseries brought about by the side effects of their Demonic Arts. Shame aside, there will also be those who speak falsehoods while believing them to be true.\"\n\"That's also a valid point.\"\n\"The final thing is the attitude of the physicians.\"\n\"...?\"\nA confused expression swept over the Demonic Physician's face.\n“These consultations demand that participants share their most vulnerable aspects. We must absolutely avoid creating an atmosphere that feels like an interrogation or giving the impression of looking down on them. We must absolutely avoid creating an atmosphere that feels like an 'interrogation' or giving off a sense of looking down on them. It's best to just listen to the other person's words in a soft atmosphere and draw out their inner feelings.\"\n\"...Easy to say, harder to do.”\n“That’s right. And, above all else, the most important thing is confidentiality. Who in their right mind would come here for counseling if they heard that we couldn’t keep their shameful secrets?”\nThe Demonic Physician was about to argue about this point, but looking at Il-mok’s somber expression, he swallowed back his argument. Check latest chapters at novel fire.net\n\"...I will make sure to emphasize this to everyone.\"\n\"I'm counting on you, elder.\"\nSnapping out of his momentary awe of the young man, the Demonic Physician said.\n“With that in mind, I suppose consulting with the Deputy Master should be next on our agenda. I’ve heard from the Heavenly Demon that you helped the First and Third Young Master, and recently Jin Hayeon, your maid, in improving their cultivation.”\nIl-mok recounted his conversations with the three in detail, and the Demonic Physician carefully recorded Il-mok's account with a serious attitude.\n\"Then, what about the Deputy Master? I heard your achievement has risen significantly recently. Are there any problems?\"\n\"......\"\nAfter pondering for a moment, Il-mok composed himself and spoke candidly about the side effects he had been suffering from lately.\n'I never thought I'd be receiving psychiatric counseling here, something I never did even in modern times.'\nOf course, he couldn't reveal everything.\nDoing so would expose his resentment towards the Heavenly Demon for forcing him to learn the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword and his anger towards the brainwashed cultists.\nEven though this was a psychiatric ward, it was a psychiatric ward belonging to the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nInsulting the Heavenly Demon or the Cult would be a death sentence.",

    "content": "Chapter 53: Foundation (3)\nAfter finishing the consultation, I rose and said, \"I'll call Miss Jin. Comparing her experiences with mine should improve accuracy.\"\n\"That's a good approach.\"\nAfter saying goodbye to the Demonic Physician, he instructed Jin Hayeon to enter.\n\"Haa.\"\nI let out a light sigh, thinking that I would be coming and going here often in the future, and began to look around the Pure Mind Hall.\nAs I did so, a familiar figure approached and greeted me.\n“Greetings, Eighth Young Master.”\n\"Have you been well, Warrior Gwan?\"\nIt was Kwan Mu-yeol, who had transferred from the Sacred Order to the Pure Mind Hall.\n“Not bad.”\nThough he said this, Kwan Mu-yeol's expression wasn't particularly bright.\nIn addition to his near-failure in protecting me, the fact that he relied on poisonous mushrooms had been revealed, leading to his transfer here. It was no different than a demotion in his eyes.\nFeeling a pang of sympathy, I spoke to console him.\n\"Don't think too negatively, Warrior Kwan.\"\nWhile unintentional, Kwan Mu-yeol had become something of a lab rat here.\nMoreover, since he was suffering from side effects similar to mine, the more progress he made, the safer I would likely be.\nDue to a bit of guilt and the need to secure my safety, it was necessary to actively appease him in a way that would resonate with a cult fanatic.\n“Perhaps serving the Cult here might be a greater contribution than serving as a martial artist in the Sacred Order.”\n\"You mean I can be of greater help to the Divine Cult here?\"\n\"Think about it. If the research at Pure Mind Hall is successful, we could reduce and manage the side effects that warriors experience. Then, many more masters would emerge in the Divine Cult. Wouldn't that be much more helpful than just one warrior like yourself becoming a master?\"\n“But that’s the work of the physicians. I’m just an experimental subject.”\n\"But that's just the work of the Demonic Physicians. I'm merely an experimental subject.\"\nWow. ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ ɴovelfire.net\nDid this guy learn the Shadowless Fourteen Moves from Third Brother? Why is he so gloomy today?\nSince my current approach wasn’t working, I decided to change tactics—from consoling to scolding.\n\"I'm disappointed, Warrior Kwan. Have you been serving the Cult with that mindset all this time? How can a martial artist of the Cult be so narrow-minded? Is that truly the behavior of someone who has followed the Cult’s doctrines for decades?”\n\"!!!\"\n\"Did you act with that thought when you were in the Sacred Order, and when you were in charge of my escort?\"\n\"No, Young Master!\" Kwan Mu-yeol exclaimed with a pale face.\n“Then, were you giving your best because you could achieve merit? Were you serving the Cult, or were you just seeking to gain a high position through merit?”\n\"Absolutely not!\"\n“Then why are you acting like this now?”\n\"That's....\"\nAs Kwan Mu-yeol belatedly realized the contradiction between his words and actions, his face turned pale, and he was unable to continue speaking.\nHe looked like he might fall into Qi Deviation, so it seemed time to offer a carrot instead of a stick.\n\"From my perspective, Warrior Kwan seems afraid.\"\n\"Afraid? What do you mean? I'm not afraid of death for the sake of the cult. Young Master!\"\n“I’m not talking about death. I’m saying you seem to be afraid of failure.”\n\"!!!\"\nSeeing Kwan Mu-yeol's startled face, I moved closer and patted his shoulder as I spoke.\n\"Warrior Kwan, everyone fails. I've failed many times, and I'll probably continue to fail in the future.\"\nKwan Mu-yeol looked at me with a strange expression.\nI wondered why he was making that face, then I saw my reflection in his eyes.\n\"...Ah, right. I'm fifteen now.\"\nHe probably found it absurd to hear a young boy talking about failure.\nBut panicking or changing my words here would only make things worse. I had to push through.\n\"You're suffering from side effects similar to mine, right? In a way, that makes you my senior. There's a saying that failure is the mother of success. Your experiences will serve as a foundation for the future generations of the Cult, including myself.”\n\"Failure is the mother of success...\"\nAs if hearing this for the first time, Kwan Mu-yeol repeated the phrase to himself.\nSeeing him in a daze, I continued pushing.\n“So please treat this as your mission and do your best. Your efforts will brighten the future of the successors, and those successors will brighten the future of the cult.\"\n\"...Are you saying that my task is that important?\"\n\"Yes. And this isn't merely for the sake of future generations.\"\n\"???\"\nSeeing Kwan Mu-yeol's puzzled expression, I moved closer and whispered in his ear.\n\"Haven't your side effects worsened recently?\"\n\"...Yes.\"\nKwan Mu-yeol's expression darkened noticeably.\nThis was understandable. His side effect was an obsession with perfection, and he had been experiencing failure after failure recently.\nHe was probably on the verge of breaking down.\n\"Think about it, Warrior Kwan. This place is a medical institution established to treat the side effects of Demonic Arts. If you actively participate in treatment here, you might be able to control those side effects and succeed in making a comeback.\"\n\"!!!\"\nI drove the final nail as Kwan Mu-yeol looked at me with surprise.\n\"For the sake of future generations. And above all, for your own future, please give your all to the treatment here.\"\n\"I will do so, Young Master.\"\nA hint of color had returned to Kwan Mu-yeol's previously gloomy face.\nAs if to reassure him, I patted his shoulder twice and turned around.\n\"......\"\nI saw Ouyang Mun's stupid-looking face with his mouth agape.\nHe really did look like a dog. I couldn't help but imagine a dog sticking out its tongue while wagging its tail.\nKwan Mu-yeol, having regained some motivation, saluted me and entered the hall.\nOnly then did Ouyang Mun come to his senses and speak with an admiring tone.\n\"The Young Master seems to have a truly mysterious power.\"\n\"Mysterious power? What are you talking about?\"\n“Well, whenever people talk to you, their faith deepens and they feel at peace, don’t they? You seem to have a talent for preaching and convincing the masses.”\n\"......\"\nBeing talented in cult recruitment—was that a compliment or an insult?\n\"And I too was deeply moved by Young Master's words.\"\nI wondered why this guy was impressed by words meant for Kwan Mu-yeol.\nAs an inexplicable sense of foreboding crept up my skin, Ouyang Mun said, \"The saying that failure is the mother of success. I'll engrave it deeply in my heart and never give up, Young Master.\"\nAs expected, my ominous feeling was never wrong.\nI sighed and said, \"Please just give up.\"\n\"Pardon? But Young Master just said...\"\n\"Just... please stop when I tell you to stop.\"\n\"But...\"\nSeeing Ouyang Mun's pitiful and desperate appearance, I sighed again and changed my words a little. \"Now is not the time. There is a saying that it’s not too late for a gentleman to take revenge even ten years later, and there is also the idiom rising from the ashes. Not giving up doesn't mean charging in right this moment.\"\nOuyang Mun’s eyes brightened as if he had an epiphany. I turned my sight from those sparkling eyes,\n‘Yeah, something will work out in ten years or so.’\nWhether this guy falls for another woman or Jin Hayeon marries someone else, something will work out.\nBut whatever happens ten years from now is not my business.\nWhile Il-mok was giving Kwan Mu-yeol and Ouyang Mun a profound sermon, Jin Hayeon, who was in the middle of the consultation with the Demonic Physician, suddenly shuddered.\nThe old man asked with a puzzled tone, \"Are you feeling unwell somewhere?\"\n\"I suddenly felt a chill. I think it might be the influence of the White Hand Demonic Art.”\n\"Well, your level has risen rapidly recently, so your body might not have adapted yet. If the coldness persists, come see me. I'll brew some medicine for you.\"\n\"How could I trouble the esteemed Demonic Physician?\"\nThe Demonic Physician burst into hearty laughter at Jin Hayeon's unique response, which was polite but completely devoid of emotion.\n“Heh, there aren’t many patients at the ward right now, so I have plenty of time. Additionally, you are now my patient, and the consultation is not yet over. When you come with the Deputy Master in the future, let's continue our conversations.\"\nThe Demonic Physician was emphasizing the title of 'Deputy Master' instead of calling Il-mok 'Eighth Young Master'.\nDue to the booklet Il-mok had handed to him and their subsequent conversation, the Demonic Physician had come to acknowledge the young Il-mok as the Deputy Master of the Pure Mind Hall.\nAnd through his consultation with Jin Hayeon following Il-mok's, the Demonic Physician realized one important fact.\n'Consultation is not something that can be completed in just one or two sessions.'\nHe couldn't fully understand Jin Hayeon's inner thoughts in a single session.\nShe did speak somewhat more in detail than when she talked to Il-mok.\nShe talked about the feelings of jealousy she had felt toward Ouyang Mun during their time at the Hall of the Demonic Way and the reason she chose the White Hand Demonic Art.\nBut that wasn’t enough. However, trying to force more information seemed to make her more guarded, so the Demonic Physician drew the line and stopped.\nYet, he didn't feel inconvenienced or annoyed by the fact that the process was being drawn out.\n'I thought only physical illnesses were complex, but the illnesses of the mind are equally profound.'\nOddly enough, the Demonic Physician's enthusiasm had grown even more.\nFrom that day forward, the Demonic Physician frequently held consultation sessions with Il-mok and Jin Hayeon.\nThis was possible because Il-mok, who had become the temporary Deputy Master of Pure Mind Hall, visited every day.\nAdditionally, Il-mok kept his promise to the Demonic Physician.\n\"Ahem. I'll be in your care.\"\n\"Make yourself comfortable. For now, we're in a patient-doctor relationship, aren't we?\"\nHe really sends the Heavenly Demon to the Pure Mind Hall as a mental patient.\n\"T-That's preposterous! T-The Heavenly Demon has already overcome all side effects! He's not a p-patient, but merely sharing his experiences!\"\nEven the best physician in the Demonic Cult could only cower in front of the Heavenly Demon.\nIn addition, Il-mok sent the Heavenly Demon's disciples to the Pure Mind Hall one by one.\nThe First Young Master Wi Jin-hak had now achieved Transcendence. The Third Young Master Seo Wan-pyeong, who suffers from paranoia, and even Jong-ri Chu, who suffers from schizophrenia.\nAfter continuing consultations with them for some time...\n“This should be enough.\"\nThe consultations with the Heavenly Demon and the First Young Master ended after only a few sessions.\nThis was natural. Both of them had already transcended the side effects of their Demonic Arts.\nUnlike others who were discussing their current ‘feelings,’ the Heavenly Demon and the First Young Master were only discussing their past ‘memories.’\nFurthermore...\n‘This won’t be of much use.’\nThe Demonic Physician, with his honed intuition, realized that their cases were almost useless.\n'The Heavenly Demon is too perfect to be of help.'\nHe had felt it before, but through these consultations, he came to fully understand the situation.\nThe current Heavenly Demon was truly a superhuman sent by heaven for the Divine Cult.\nA figure who dedicated his entire life solely to martial arts and the affairs of the Divine Cult.\nIn his youth, he devoted all his time to martial arts, and with a talent that could be called a genius and a phenomenal mental power, he overcame the side effects of all Demonic Arts.\nAfter overcoming the side effects of the most terrifying Demonic Art, the Heavenly Demon Divine Arts, he had been working solely for the cult as the Heavenly Demon.\nBecause of this, he never married and had no heirs, and he only took his first disciple after turning seventy.\nAs a cult member, he was a perfect example for others.\nBut from a physician’s perspective, he was too perfect—a case impossible to apply to others.\nAnd as for First Young Master Wi Jin-hak...\n'Aside from his final conversation with the Deputy Master, his case isn't about treatment, but about borrowing a knife to kill.'\nIn fact, the Demonic Physician knew this even before the consultation.\nHow Wi Jin-hak had overcome the side effects of his Demonic Art before he achieved Transcendence through his conversation with Il-mok.\nWhenever his anger surged, he would go to the Central Plains and slaughter corrupt officials and martial artists.\nAnd that method was a method that, if a thousand people tried, nine hundred and ninety-nine would go to the underworld.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 54 : Foundation (4)",
    "content": "Chapter 54: Foundation (4)\nAs consultations with the Heavenly Demon and his disciples concluded, with the Heavenly Demon and First Young Master finishing first, the Demonic Physician began counseling sessions with new individuals.\nThese included the Right and Left Guardian, the Elder Council, the Law Enforcement Division Master, the Pavilion Lord of the Hidden Guard Pavilion, and the heads of the Five Great Families—all counted among the top martial artists in the Heavenly Demon Divine Sect.\nThe reason these sessions began right after Heavenly Demon and his disciples was due to Il-mok's influence.\n\"We should start with those who have already achieved Transcendence with high-level Demonic Arts.\"\nHearing his suggestion, the Demonic Physician couldn’t help but express doubt.\n\"Do you really think they will participate earnestly in counseling?\"\n\"We have already obtained justification. If even Master decided to participate in counseling, why won’t they?”\n\"As the Deputy Master said, since the Heavenly Demon participated in counseling, they won't be able to refuse. But, whether they respond honestly or not is another matter, isn't it?\"\n\"There's no need to worry about that. You mentioned it yourself, regarding Master and Eldest Senior Brother.\"\nThe Demonic Physician, understanding Il-mok's intention, asked, \"You mean they can speak more freely because they viewed them as past memories, not current side effects they're suffering from?\"\n“Isn’t that common? People hide their problems when they're actively struggling, but once everything has passed, they feel much lighter about discussing them.\"\n\"That's true to some extent. But, even so, aren't there memories one would rather keep hidden?\"\n\"That won't be a major issue. It doesn't matter much if they don't participate actively.\"\nThe Demonic Physician could barely hide his bewilderment, so Il-mok added an explanation to resolve his confusion.\n\"Didn't you say it yourself, Hall Master? That the experiences of those who've achieved Transcendence with high-level Demonic Arts aren't very helpful to those currently struggling because they're simply too exceptional.\"\n\"...Then why exactly should we prioritize counseling with them?\"\n\"While they may not be of great help, there's still a possibility they could be of some assistance. And the most important thing is that we can gain justification.\"\n\"Ah!\"\nOnly then did the Demonic Physician fully understand Il-mok's intention.\n\"If we start counseling with the higher-ups, those currently suffering from side effects won't easily refuse either.\"\n\"Additionally, they'll think that even their superiors honestly discussed their problems, so they are more likely to respond to counseling a little more honestly.\"\nThe Demonic Doctor, who accepted Il-mok's logic, went to the Heavenly Demon and told him about the conversation they had, and the Heavenly Demon accepted the suggestion.\nIl-mok’s Master issued an order as the Heavenly Demon, instructing the key figures of the cult to receive counseling from the Pure Mind Hall.\nSoon, these consultations concluded, even before those of Jin Hayeon and the other disciples.\nAs with the Heavenly Demon and the First Disciple, the sessions with those who had achieved Transcendence were more about listening to their experiences than conducting in-depth counseling.\nWith the consultations of the highest-ranking members completed, Il-mok proposed a new idea.\n\"Now that we have some case studies, shouldn't other physicians begin conducting consultations? You can't handle all the cult members alone, Hall Master.\"\n\"That's true.\"\nThe Demonic Physician couldn't deny it. Regardless of his ability, time was severely limited.\nBut Il-mok's next words were something that even the Demonic Physician hadn't anticipated.\n\"And from now on, please omit the patients' names when documenting the consultations.\"\n\"!? That’s absurd, Deputy Master!\"\n\"!? W-What do you mean, Deputy Master?\"\n\"Exactly what I said. Who would want their mental illnesses and the dark history they committed because of them to be recorded?\"\n\"But if we remove the patients' names, the records will get mixed up and become indistinguishable. You know that counseling doesn't end in just one session.\"\n\"That's why I said 'when documenting.' Each physician can identify patients by name during the sessions, but after the consultation concludes, they should organize the records, omit the names, and categorize them solely by the type of Demonic Art and side effect.\"\nThe Demonic Physician now understood Il-mok's intention but pointed out a flaw.\n\"Your intention is good, but ultimately, the physicians conducting the consultation will still know whose record it is, won't they? Their colleagues could easily deduce it as well. It won't be very effective.\"\n\"That's why, as I said before, the most important thing is to keep the currently active physicians’ mouths shut. As for future generations, without names, it will be much harder to identify individuals.\"\n\"Keeping them silent...\"\n\"That's the most important part. So...\"\nIl-mok shared with the Demonic Physician the measures he had devised over the past few days to ensure the physicians’ silence.\nHe continued to propose solutions and improvements to Pure Mind Hall’s operations almost daily.\nThe Demonic Physician, the Hall Master of the Pure Mind Hall, couldn't hide his astonishment. How could so many different wisdoms come from the head of that young boy?\nTrue to his title of the Demonic Physician, he almost wanted to open up Il-mok's head to study his brain.\nHowever, Il-mok wasn't acting out of pure altruism.\nEven after being appointed as the interim Deputy Master of the Pure Mind Hall by his Master, he still had to endure the relentless onslaught of killing intent and demonic energy from the training with the Heavenly Demon.\nThe daily life-or-death sparring sessions, saturated with killing intent and demonic energy, had reawakened his dormant instinct, accelerating his growth.\n—If we continue like this, there's no way to catch the physicians if they leak information.\n—What if people lie?\nHis obsessive-compulsive tendencies worsened daily. Worst-case scenarios constantly bombarded him, and his mind raced to find solutions.\nOnly after sharing solutions with the Demonic Physician and seeing improvements did he find some peace of mind.\nIn other words, he wasn't doing this because he enjoyed it. He was merely pouring out his opinions as if vomiting out the worms crawling in his brain.\nIf there was a silver lining.\n'That's right. Once the Pure Mind Hall succeeds, it might be able to cure my side effects.'\nIt was the hope that improving this place would secure his future safety.\nIf not for that, he might have succumbed to a combination of obsessive thoughts and depression.\n'Passing the Hall of the Demonic Way entrance examination is practically guaranteed now. So, I'll just establish the framework of the Pure Mind Hall, graduate from the Hall of the Demonic Way, kill that Flying Dragon Unit Leader guy or whatever to avenge Uncle Tae-hyeon, and then rest!!'\nFueled by this thought, Il-mok endured the Heavenly Demon's torment and dedicated himself to Pure Mind Hall’s development.\nIn any case, thanks to the various improvements Il-mok proposed, the Pure Mind Hall quickly took shape.\nAs Il-mok had planned, the martial artists at the headquarters also began to receive counseling at Pure Mind Hall one by one, and records of various Demonic Arts were compiled daily.\nOne day, the Demonic Physician, now focused on organizing and analyzing the records submitted by the physicians, had a profound realization.\n'...Perhaps the Deputy Master has conceived something truly extraordinary.' Newest update provıded by novel⸺fire.net\nIt wasn't a negative assessment.\nHe simply foresaw an outcome beyond the imagination of ordinary individuals.\nIn the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, Demonic Arts were synonymous with side effects. Conversely, experience in cultivating Demonic Arts equated to experience in battling side effects.\nAnd here, in this very place, within the countless records of consultations conducted by the Demonic Physicians and his fellow physicians, lies the history of their struggles\nFor now, records are accumulated mainly by masters, but what if more time passes?\n'From Tainted to Extremity, and even to Transcendence—something that compiles all the growth processes of Demonic Arts and methods to deal with side effects might be created.'\nA perfect textbook and guide for mastering Demonic Arts would be born.\nIf that happened, many more would achieve Transcendence, and the revival of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult would be beyond doubt.\nAfter all, Demonic Arts, despite their drawbacks, offered unparalleled growth.\n'Though it may be foolish to envision such a bright future when we've barely taken the first step, I can't help but dream of such a golden age.'\nWith a sigh of contentment, the Demonic Physician turned his gaze somewhere else, to the direction of the Windrock Palace, where Il-mok resided.\n‘Did the Deputy Master request the Heavenly Demon to create this Pure Mind Hall, thinking of such a future?’\nThe golden future he envisioned would only be possible after decades of accumulating many more records. He thought it would take at least ten years, even at the fastest.\nBy then, the next Heavenly Demon would be leading the Cult, and the Eighth Young Master would likely be a prominent figure, perhaps even vying for the position of Heavenly Demon.\n'...Truly a fearsome young man.'\nHaving thought this far, the Demonic Physician couldn't help but shudder as goosebumps covered his body.\nAfter being appointed as the Deputy Master of Pure Mind Hall, Il-mok's time flew by.\nHe was constantly busy with his studies, training for the entrance examination to the Hall of the Demonic Way, and managing the affairs of the Pure Mind Hall.\n\"Hehehe.\"\nIf there was some solace in his life, it was watching Seon-ah's playful antics when she visited daily and watching Ouyang Mun's embarrassing attempts to woo Jin Hayeon.\nAt least this time, Ouyang-mun seemed to somewhat understand Il-mok's advice, showing a bit more caution instead of his usual reckless approach.\nAnd as he lived busily, various changes were occurring.\nIl-mok's cultivation rose steeply, and the Pure Mind Hall quickly established its system.\nThis didn't mean Il-mok was a genius.\nThere were two main reasons why Il-mok could quickly establish the Pure Mind Hall's system.\nOne was that, as a modern person, he could draw on the hospital practices he had experienced directly or indirectly and by combining that with the common knowledge he possessed, he was able to swiftly create a rough framework of the psychiatric ward that he had envisioned.\nThe other reason was that this place was essentially a cult.\nAdministration was typically a battle against budget constraints.\nHowever, Il-mok didn't need to consider such limitations.\nWhen Il-mok proposed to the Demonic Physician or Heavenly Demon that certain things needed to be done for a purpose, the Heavenly Demon would issue orders.\nFrom that point on, the fanatics would carry out the tasks with their utmost devotion, serving the cult without expecting any material compensation.\nThanks to this, there was no need to worry about labor costs. The only limitation was whether it could be done or not.\nEstablishing the counseling system of the Pure Mind Hall, training new physicians, gathering medical texts and folk remedies, and acquiring various medicinal herbs and ingredients were relatively easy tasks.\nHe could simply exploit the manpower through religious fervor.\nThe real challenge was developing and testing medicines based on the acquired knowledge.\nAs they delved into researching medical texts and folk remedies, the Hall of the Demonic Way entrance examination was only two months away.\nYet, Il-mok still visited the Pure Mind Hall daily.\n\"Greetings to the Deputy Master.\"\n\"Welcome, Deputy Master.\"\nThe physicians and the Demonic Physician there welcomed Il-mok.\nThe playful Demonic Physician who had treated Il-mok like a child was now gone.\nAt some point, the Demonic Physician had begun treating Il-mok as an equal.\nAnd with newfound confidence in the Pure Mind Hall's work, the Demonic Physician and the physicians were now overflowing with enthusiasm.\nEspecially with the influx of new medical texts and folk remedies, their thirst for knowledge was bubbling over.\n\"Deputy Master! According to this medical book that I searched all night yesterday, if you eat this medicinal herb, your mind will be much more relaxed, your body will be lethargic, and you will be freed from all pain.\"\nA young physician, his eyes bloodshot like those of a mad scientist, presented his findings to Il-mok.\nAfter examining the contents of the medical text and the herb the physician presented, Il-mok responded with an incredulous expression:\n\"That... isn't that a drug?\"\nThe crazed physician was trying to turn the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult into a drug den.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 55 : Foundation (5)",
    "content": "Chapter 55: Foundation (5)\nThe crazed physician's eyes sparkled with excitement, clearly misunderstanding Il-mok's point.\n\"A Demonic Drug (魔藥)... If we interpret it as utilizing something evil (惡) to paradoxically mend the mind, it seems a truly fitting name for our Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, Deputy Master!”\nIl-mok felt a headache coming on.\nUpon reflection, he realized that in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, the character evil (Ma, 魔) didn’t carry a negative connotation.\n\"That's not what I meant. It means a drug that is also harmful to the mind. Those who come to the Pure Mind Hall are already mentally unwell—how can we give them something that further damages their minds?\"\nAt Il-mok’s rebuttal, the Demonic Physician himself frowned, siding with the young physician.\n“Deputy Master, there is a saying within the Jianghu to fight poison with poison. Furthermore, didn’t you acknowledge that what is poison to one may be medicine to another? Couldn’t this ‘Demonic Drug’ you speak of be medicine for some?\"\nWith even the Demonic Physician opposing him, Il-mok felt a chill.\n'If I don't nip this in the bud right now, it's going to be a catastrophic disaster.'\nThese individuals were already prone to superstition and fanaticism. What would happen if they started dabbling in drugs?\nIt was impossible even to fathom what kind of disaster might unfold.\nAnd most terrifying was the possibility that he himself could be at risk.\nHe feared that one day, while battling the side effects of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, these fucking lunatics might prescribe him the very narcotics he was trying to forbid.\nAs Il-mok grappled with how to persuade them, a memory from his past life in the modern world surfaced.\n\"Summon Warrior Kwan immediately!\"\nAt Il-mok's command, a physician hurried off and swiftly returned with Kwan Mu-yeol.\n\"I greet the Deputy Master,” Kwan Mu-yeol greeted with clasped hands.\nIl-mok acknowledged the greeting briefly before cutting straight to the point.\n\"Warrior Kwan, I have questions about those poisonous mushrooms you used previously.\"\nA visible flinch betrayed Kwan Mu-yeol's discomfort at the mention of this sensitive topic. But he steadied himself.\n\"Please ask, I am at your service.\"\n“You mentioned that after consuming a small amount of those poisonous mushrooms, you experienced hallucinations and a sense of peace. Is that correct?\"\n\"Yes, that's right.\"\n\"And afterward? What happened then?\"\n\"...I'm not quite sure what you're asking.\"\n\"After returning to your normal life, did you constantly think about those mushrooms?\"\n\"...Yes, I did.\"\nIl-mok nodded at Kwan Mu-yeol's answer, then turned to address the physicians.\n\"This is precisely the greatest danger of drugs. It's a monstrous entity that, once indulged in, becomes impossible to resist. That's why they're called Demonic Drugs (魔藥).\"\nThis wasn't just about chemical addiction. During his time as Seo Jihoon, he had accidentally stumbled upon an online testimony from a drug addict.\nThe testimony described how the pleasure from drugs was an extraordinary ecstasy impossible to experience in ordinary life. Yet, that very pleasure was the devil's trap.\nA brain steeped even once in unprecedented pleasure becomes unable to return to normal life.\nIl-mok directed his question to the physician who had discovered the narcotic.\n\"Physician Seo, when was the happiest moment of your life?\"\nThe physician glanced briefly at the Demon Physician before returning his gaze to Il-mok.\n\"…It was the day Elder Demonic Physician first acknowledged me as a true physician.”\n\"Now imagine finding a single coin on the ground. Could you compare that to the happiness of that day?\"\n\"Absolutely not. The joy of that day would render a coin meaningless.\"\n\"That's exactly why drugs are demonic. The moment you consume drugs, even your happiest memory will become less meaningful than finding a mere coin.\"\n\"!?\"\nSeeing the physicians' disbelief, Il-mok turned to Kwan Mu-yeol.\n\"The peace you found through those mushrooms—could you ever find greater peace in your everyday life after that?\"\n\"...No. That's why they kept coming to mind.\"\nNodding at Kwan Mu-yeol's answer, Il-mok addressed the physicians again.\n\"The countless joys of everyday life—achieving dreams through hard work, attaining success, sharing love with a partner, bonding with children, discovering truth in doctrine—a brain that’s tasted drugs can no longer feel these everyday joys. Why? Because it’s already tasted something incomparably greater, rendering all else insignificant by comparison.\"\nA mind with its threshold for happiness and pleasure drastically elevated can no longer find satisfaction in anything but narcotics.\nThe final lines of the online confession Seo Ji-hoon had read echoed in his mind.\nWatching drug users in movies or dramas might spark curiosity. Some people might think, 'If I try it just once and quit, I won't get addicted.'\nBut the author of the confession had a stark reply.\n—That single instance would extinguish all the joys of everyday life, plunging the user into a hell from which there is no escape.\nThat's why it was necessary to absolutely prohibit it from the start.\nHowever, the Demonic Physician objected.\n“But this is the Pure Mind Hall. For those who come here plagued by depression or despair, there might be no better medicine than this. Didn’t Warrior Kwan consume those mushrooms for that very reason?\"\nThough it sounded reasonable at first glance, Il-mok shook his head.\n\"Consider it from the opposite perspective. The moment ordinary individuals succumb to drugs, their daily lives become tedious, dull, and depressing. Then what happens to our patients when the drugs wear off?\"\n\"!!!\" ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ novel·fıre·net\n\"Everyday life would feel like living hell. They would see only two options: death or taking the drug again. Yes, this is the Pure Mind Hall, and that’s exactly why these substances must be absolutely forbidden.\"\nAmidst the silence, the young physician, perhaps still reluctant to abandon the idea, asked, \"Then what if we prescribe it only until side effects fade—\"\n\"Nonsense! We're talking about substances that forcibly induce euphoria, hallucinations, and delusions. Do you truly believe they won't have side effects on the human brain and body?\"\nThus, thanks to Il-mok's vehement opposition, the discussion about drugs in the Pure Mind Hall was more or less concluded.\nIt was agreed that any medicinal herbs or ingredients discovered through research or folk remedies that forcibly induced pleasure, hallucinations, or delusions would be strictly prohibited.\n\"Thank you for sharing your experience, Warrior Kwan.\"\n\"It's nothing, Deputy Master.\"\nIl-mok patted the seemingly despondent Kwan Mu-yeol on the shoulder, offering words of comfort.\n\"It's fortunate that your willpower is so strong, Warrior Kwan. You endured precisely because you only consumed small amounts and avoided its use whenever possible, did you not? I have faith that you will overcome this and rise again.\"\n\"I will strive to live up to your expectations, Deputy Master.\"\nAfter Kwan Mu-yeol departed with a respectful bow, Il-mok requested a private meeting with the Demonic Physician.\nThere was still an unfinished conversation.\n\"I couldn't speak freely with the other physicians present, but there is exactly one case where drugs could be utilized.\"\n\"!?\"\nFacing the Medical Master's dumbfounded expression, Il-mok continued.\n\"However, it should be employed in the Medical Hall, not here.”\n\"In Medical Hall, you say?\"\n\"Yes. For patients in excruciating pain, on the verge of death, or undergoing procedures that involve unbearable agony, this substance can be used as a type of painkiller.”\nEven in the modern world, this was the sole legitimate use of narcotics: as analgesics in hospitals or on battlefields for those suffering from horrific illnesses or injuries.\n\"But as I mentioned earlier, drugs are extremely dangerous. In my opinion, even in the Medical Hall, only the Head Physician should have the authority to prescribe it, and their use must be strictly prohibited unless a life is truly hanging in the balance.\"\n\"That explains why you waited until the other physicians were gone to tell me this.\"\nThe Medical Master nodded in understanding, then muttered almost to himself, \"Pain-relieving effects...\"\nSuddenly, as if struck by a realization, he looked at Il-mok and exclaimed, \"Perhaps when Hua Tuo removed the arrow from Guan Yu's shoulder, he used what we're calling drugs!\"\n(TL Note: Guan Yu, surnamed Guan, courtesy name Yunchang. One of the famous generals of the Three Kingdoms Era. Hua Tuo, a renowned physician from the same era as Guan Yu. He is famous for his advanced medical knowledge that surpasses his era and for his entanglement with Cao Cao, another warlord of that era, which resulted in his execution.)\nTrue to his nature as a physician consumed by his craft, the old man's mind raced with possibilities.\n\"Hahaha! This could potentially pave the way for various treatments that were previously deemed too agonizing to attempt!\"\nSeeing the Demonic Physician’s excitement, Il-mok sighed and reminded him, “I trust I made it clear that utmost caution must be exercised in its use.”\n\"Worry not. I’ll only use it for those already at death’s door. No need for risky treatments otherwise!\"\nStill feeling uneasy, Il-mok visited the Heavenly Demon that night.\nHe relayed everything about the drug debate and his own opinions.\nThe next morning, a solemn edict from the Heavenly Demon was issued throughout the Divine Cult:\n—The use, research, and prescription of ma-yak, or any suspected ma-yak substances or ingredients, is permitted solely for the Master of the Pure Mind Hall and the Head Physician of the Medical Hall.\n—Should either the Head of the Pure Mind Hall or the Head of the Medical Hall show any inclination towards excessive prescription, use, or research of said substances, they shall face extreme punishment.\nTime continued its relentless march even after the commotion surrounding narcotics had settled.\nAt the Pure Mind Hall, they began researching medicinal herbs and ingredients—excluding prohibited substances—to identify those that affect mental conditions.\nThey made some discoveries.\nThe young physician who had initially proposed using drugs to Il-mok achieved a small breakthrough in his research.\nDrawing from the idea that people become more depressed after coming down from drug effects, he experimented with substances that enhanced mood.\nThe results revealed that foods high in sugar, including candy, actually tend to amplify feelings of depression and anxiety.\nWhile consuming sweet foods provided an immediate mood boost, it was followed by a deeper sense of depression and unease.\nAlthough limited by the lack of advanced scientific knowledge, this discovery—despite a limited understanding of the biological and chemical mechanisms involved—was a significant step forward.\nAdditionally, as an aftereffect of the incident with the Black Bean Demon Tea, numerous experiments were conducted on various teas and fruit preserves.\nThis led to the disposal of a considerable portion of the teas stocked in the tea room and the identification of several unique blends that calmed the mind and improved mental well-being.\nIl-mok himself became a regular consumer of these teas.\n'This smells similar to the tea Lee Ji-yeon used to drink.'\nWith this thought, whether it was psychological or not, he felt his compulsive symptoms had somewhat eased since avoiding sugary foods and drinking these teas.\nMeanwhile, the remaining two months passed quickly.\n\"Ha ha ha! Excellent, truly excellent.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon stroked his beard and laughed heartily as he watched Il-mok perform the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\nAlthough Il-mok had managed to touch upon the realm of manifesting sword qi thanks to Jang Hwi’s attack, his mastery was initially incomplete. He couldn't manifest it freely at will, only managing to generate sword qi when executing the Soul-Departing Sword, the First Form of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, and the one most familiar to him.\nBut now, half a year later, he could now generate and maintain sword qi throughout all fourteen stances of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\nProvided he had sufficient internal energy, that is.\nIronically, despite consuming the Explosive Demonic Pill, his internal energy cultivation lagged behind his swordsmanship. Consequently, while he could now wield sword qi freely, his insufficient internal energy made it difficult for Il-mok to sustain it for extended periods.\nSeeing this potential, the Heavenly Demon, driven by a desire to accelerate his progress, even made a suggestion to Il-mok.\n\"How about consuming another Explosive Demonic Pill?\"\nIl-mok vehemently rejected the suggestion, practically convulsing at the thought.\n\"That would be unfair, Master. As the revered Lord of Ten Thousand Demons, you must be a paragon of virtue. I, too, as your disciple must set an example.\"\nToo pleased by his disciple's response, he was completely oblivious to Il-mok’s true thought.\n'I'm already half insane from consuming one pill. If I take another, I might end up enrolling in the Pure Mind Hall instead of the Hall of the Demonic Way.'\n“Haha, your skills are comparable to your Eldest Brother when he enrolled in the Hall of the Demonic Way. To achieve this in just one year is a testament to how talented you are.”\n\"You flatter me, Master.\"\n\"I'm pleased to see your lack of arrogance. Since you've only mastered the first fourteen forms, I shall now impart the latter eight secret techniques. Learn the forms and their principles now, then perfect the latter eight techniques in your time within the Hall of the Demonic Way.”\nIl-mok sighed inwardly.\n'Has the time already come?'\nIn a few days, the entrance exams for the Hall of the Demonic Way will be held.\nThis was a threat that had been looming ever since he was first brought to this damned cult.\nBack then, he had doubted whether he could even pass the exam, but now, everyone seemed to take his success in the assessment as a foregone conclusion.\n'The Hall of the Demonic Way...'\nHaving gained a deeper understanding of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, Il-mok used a different name for the Hall of the Demonic Way in his journal.\n‘Holding Facility for Prospective Mental Patients.’",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 56 : Mental Asylum (1)",
    "content": "Chapter 56: Mental Asylum (1)\nA few days later, early in the morning.\nHaving finished his breakfast, Il-mok began a day different from his usual routine. Instead of attending his morning lesson with Jin Hayeon, he departed directly from Windrock Palace and headed elsewhere.\nHe arrived at a sprawling estate, its grounds encompassing several training areas divided into distinct sections.\n\"Are you the Eighth Young Master?\"\nWhen Il-mok nodded at the guard’s question, the man pointed towards the leftmost area.\n\"Your examination will take place there.\"\n\"Thank you for the guidance,\" Il-mok replied with a nod, trying to shake off his tension as he headed toward the indicated location.\n\"Ah, there you are.\"\nA man in his forties with a playful glint in his eyes greeted him.\n“I need you to know that within the Hall of the Demonic Way, everyone operates solely according to its rules, regardless of family or rank, Eighth Young Master. So don’t feel slighted if someone didn’t show you formal courtesy.”\nHiding his inner tension, Il-mok responded to the man's joking tone, \"I don't mind, Instructor.\"\n\"Hahaha! To be called Instructor by the Heavenly Demon's disciple—I’ve truly made it.\"\nThe instructor's jovial demeanor, however, only served to heighten Il-mok's inner vigilance.\nThe reason was simple.\nHe wasn’t afraid of failing his exam. Rather, it was because this was the Demonic Cult.\n'I don't know what kind of madman he might be. I can't let my guard down.'\nHe could afford to relax since there was no predicting what deranged stunt this lunatic might pull mid-test.\nAfter a year in this damned cult, Il-mok knew one thing well.\nThe only relatively sane people here were either the top-tier masters who had cultivated high-tier Demonic Arts to the point of achieving Transcendence or the low-ranking warriors who practiced only basic techniques.\nIronically, it was these mediocre bastards who were the most unhinged.\nAs an instructor within the Hall of the Demonic Way responsible for training only the finest talents of this damned cult, there is no way the person before him cultivated low-level Demonic Art.\nYet, since he was merely an instructor and not the Hall Master, he likely hadn't achieved Transcendence in his Demonic Art.\nIn other words, the instructors at the Hall of the Demonic Way were martial artists at the peak of their madness, living and time-ticking bombs waiting to explode.\nJust then, the broadly smiling instructor spoke again.\n\"Well then, let's begin.\"\nWithout any preamble or explanation, he abruptly lunged at Il-mok while employing swift footwork.\nThis might have seemed strange elsewhere, but in this damned cult, this was considered normal. It would be nonsensical for someone hoping to enter the Hall of the Demonic Way to come without knowing the examination method.\nMoreover, even if they were unaware, it wouldn't matter.\nAnyone who fell victim to such a simple surprise attack wouldn't qualify for the Hall of the Demonic Way anyway.\nAnd Il-mok didn't disappoint the instructor's expectations.\nClang!\nWith a flash of his Soul-Departing Sword, Il-mok effortlessly deflected the instructor's palm strike that had come diving in suddenly.\n\"Oho~\"\nAs if discovering an interesting toy, the instructor let out a curious hum and continued his offensive.\nThe bare-handed instructor pressed Il-mok, moving both palms with surprising fluidity in his movements.\nSometimes he alternated between left and right palms, unleashing a barrage of unpredictable attacks. Sometimes he launched powerful strikes with both palms simultaneously.\nBut Il-mok calmly blocked or evaded the onslaught.\n'I'm quite familiar with palm techniques.'\nThe fact that the instructor's primary martial art was palm technique could be considered fortunate for Il-mok.\nBesides his Master, the Heavenly Demon, the opponents Il-mok had sparred with most frequently were Jin Hayeon and Seon-ah, both of whom were practitioners of palm techniques and claw techniques, respectively. Though their techniques differed, the countermeasures were somewhat similar.\nAfter steadily weathering the instructor's attacks for a while, Il-mok's movements began to change as he grew accustomed to his opponent's patterns.\nWith concise sword movements, he utilized his sword to limit the instructor’s movement while simultaneously utilizing footwork to create distance.\nThe most fundamental aspect of combat is distance—maintaining or creating a distance that's advantageous to oneself and disadvantageous to the opponent.\nWhether facing fists, palms, hands, claws, or fingers, the simplest strategy for a swordsman like Il-mok against an unarmed opponent remained the same.\nThat is to maintain a distance where his sword could reach, but out of the opponent's reach.\nThis was a basic principle known to every swordsman, yet its simplicity belied its difficulty in execution.\nClang!\nWith a sudden burst of speed, Il-mok created a gap of about a step between himself and the instructor.\nMaintaining this distance, he launched a relentless flurry of sword strikes.\nClang!\nSwish!\nThe sounds of metal clashing against metal filled the air as Il-mok's sword met the instructor's palms.\nAt times, the instructor evaded Il-mok's attacks with uncanny footwork.\nHowever, despite blocking or dodging Il-mok's sword, he couldn't find an opening to counterattack.\n\"Hmm~?\"\nAfter several attempts to break through were thwarted, the instructor's eyes gleamed as he made another curious sound.\n'This one has no sense of nervousness, does he?'\nThe instructor felt something unusual. It was as if he were facing a weathered swordsman who had trained for at least ten years and survived hundreds of life-or-death battles.\nEven amidst the ceaseless flurry of sword strikes, Il-mok showed no signs of faltering posture or exposing any openings.\nWhile swinging his sword continuously, Il-mok’s stances remained stable and left no openings for a counter.\n'It seems the Heavenly Demon didn't choose him without reason.'\nA smile of genuine interest spread across the instructor's face, and his aura shifted.\nPat!\nDrawing internal energy deeper from his dantian, the instructor displayed footwork at a much faster pace than before.\nThe abrupt change in speed created an effect similar to a surprise attack, allowing the instructor to close the distance by a step in an instant.\nHe unleashed a palm strike.\nUnlike before, demonic energy swirled around the instructor's palm.\nSensing a surge of danger, Il-mok immediately channeled his internal energy to manifest his sword qi.\nCLANG!!\nA deafening screech rang out as Il-mok deployed the Soul-Cutting Flash, imbued with the principles of swift swordsmanship to block the instructor’s attack.\nIl-mok couldn't help but frown as they clashed this time.\nIt wasn't because of internal injuries from the collision.\n'Tsk. It's not just demonic energy.'\nA numbing sensation coursed through his hand gripping the sword.\nThat demonic energy was infused with lightning qi.\nBut Il-mok didn't panic.\nThough it was his first time directly experiencing lightning qi, he had faced similar situations before.\nChanneling his own internal energy, he forced the invading current back and simultaneously executed the Soul-Guiding Sword imbued with the principle of redirection to deflect the connected black palm.\nClang!\nAt the same time, he changed positions with his footwork and swung his sword relentlessly, seamlessly blending real and feigned attacks to prevent the instructor from countering,\n'Sparring with Jin Hayeon has been helpful in many ways.'\nThough Jin Hayeon’s White Hand Demonic Art wasn’t lightning-based, the experience of countering invasive energy—where direct clashes risked numbness from creeping cold—proved invaluable.\nHowever, one significant problem remained.\nIl-mok was still about two levels below Jin Hayeon, while the instructor was several levels above her.\nSeeing Il-mok managed to withstand his offensive until now, the instructor decided to up his ante.\nPat!\n\"Hup!\"\nIl-mok was once again forced onto the defensive.\nMaintaining distance or completely dodging the palm strikes became increasingly difficult, and eventually, he had no choice but to block the instructor's black palm with his sword.\n\"Ugh.\"\nA muffled groan escaped Il-mok's lips as the tingling lightning energy coursed through his sword, but he narrowly managed to escape the onslaught and hold his ground.\nBut that didn't last long.\nSwoosh!\nSurprisingly, at some point, Il-mok began to counterattack again.\nIt was because the forms had become familiar to his eyes.\nDespite the escalating speed and power, the forms remained the same. Il-mok had memorized the patterns of the instructor's palm strikes and their trajectories.\nIl-mok, who had seemed completely overwhelmed, started launching occasional counterattacks.\n'Now!' The most update n0vels are published on novel※fire.net\nSeizing a fleeting opportunity, Il-mok's sword traced a perfect arc towards the instructor's head.\nAnd just before the sword could pierce the instructor's head—\nPat!\nMoving at a speed far faster than before, the instructor's hand instantly caught Il-mok's sword.\n\"Whew. That's enough.\"\nAfter exhaling deeply, the instructor returned to his original smiling face and released Il-mok's sword.\n\"Thank you for teaching me a lesson.\"\nAs Il-mok quickly sheathed his sword and cupped his hands in respect, the instructor laughed heartily and pointed to a nearby building.\n“Hahahaha. It was just a spar, hardly worth calling a lesson. There is still the interview portion. Go to that hall over there.\"\nIl-mok bowed once more and headed toward the hall.\n'Hmm? He seems more normal than I expected. Could he be a master who has achieved Transcendence?'\nLost in thought, Il-mok glanced back over his shoulder, his eyes meeting the instructor's, who was waving with a friendly smile.\nA sudden chill ran down Il-mok's spine. He offered a quick nod of farewell and hastened his pace.\n'What was that?'\nIl-mok couldn't understand the reason for his unease.\nChu Il-hwan, the instructor, watched with an amiable smile as the Eighth Young Master—the Heavenly Demons' youngest disciple and recent subject of numerous rumors within the cult—entered the pavilion.\nHis pupils narrowed like a snake's.\nWith a face like a predator eyeing its prey, he moistened his lips with his tongue.\n“That was close. I almost got carried away and killed him.”\nHis Demonic Art, the Black Thunder Demonic Palm contained one side effect.\nAnd that side effect is a homicidal impulse.\nArriving at the pavilion, Il-mok waited briefly for his turn before being ushered into a room for his interview.\nThe instructor waiting inside confirmed Il-mok's identity and posed the first question, \"Excluding the current Heavenly Demon, Hyeokryeon Il-hwi, who do you consider to be the greatest among the past Heavenly Demons, and why?”\nThis wasn’t simply a question about selecting a respected figure.\n'It's a question that combines historical records and doctrinal writings.'\nAs objects of faith, the achievements of the previous Heavenly Demons were extensively recorded in historical records.\nMoreover, each Heavenly Demon’s achievements were diverse and could be interpreted in various ways according to the cult's doctrines.\nIn essence, the question aimed to gauge which doctrines Il-mok valued most, requiring him to articulate his personal views while weaving them into the historical narrative and the cult's teachings.\nThere was no single correct answer, but a clear and well-reasoned explanation grounded in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's doctrines was essential.\n“I believe the achievements of the Seventh Heavenly Demon, the Bloodthirsty Heavenly Demon, were the greatest. The reason being...\"\nIl-mok answered the instructor's question without hesitation.\nHe had already encountered similar questions during the dozens of mock interviews conducted with Jin Hayeon in preparation for the examination.\nFollowing that, the instructor posed various other questions.\nSome had definite correct answers, while others required expressing personal views intertwined with the cult’s doctrine, law, or history.\nThe common thread among these diverse questions was—\n\"That concludes my answer.\"\n—that Il-mok could answer each one flawlessly.\nAfter about fifteen minutes spent exchanging a dozen or so questions and answers, the instructor nodded and said, \"The results will be posted on a notice board in two days. Come back then.\"\nTwo days later.\nIl-mok, accompanied by Jin Hayeon and Ouyang Mun, returned to the sprawling estate where the Hall of the Demonic Way entrance examination had been held.\nNear the entrance, a crowd had gathered, their reactions ranging from jubilation to despair.\nFortunately, the number of people wasn't overwhelming.\n'I heard they only accept the cream of the crop, so the number of candidates taking the assessment isn't that high to begin with.’\nPassing through the not-so-dense crowd to approach the wall, Il-mok looked at the posted notice.\nFortunately, Il-mok didn't need to search hard to find his name.\nIt was written at the very top of the notice.\n\"Congratulations, Young Master.\"\n\"Hahaha! As expected of Young Master Il-mok, I knew you would pass as the top seat!\"\nJin Hayeon offered a simple congratulations while Ouyang Mun seems to be more excited than Il-mok himself.\nIl-mok's expression was a mixture of apprehension and resignation.\n'So now I'm really going in...'\nInto a dreadful facility filled with instructors composed of madmen and fellow students full of potential madmen in the making.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 57 : Mental Asylum (2)",
    "content": "Chapter 57: Mental Asylum (2)\nA few days later.\nIl-mok awoke early in the morning, packed his belongings, and left his room.\nThe Hall of the Demonic Way wasn't located within the main headquarters but on another peak of the Tianshan Mountain Range. Once admitted to the Hall, students were rarely allowed to return to the main headquarters for the duration of their two-year training period.\nSince he'd be living in the dormitory-like facilities, he needed to bring essentials. Though according to Jin Hayeon, basic necessities were provided by the Hall itself.\nSeveral people had gathered at Windrock Palace to see Il-mok off. At the center stood his Master, Hyeokryeon Il-hwi, the Heavenly Demon and the Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\n\"Hahaha. The saying 'After three days apart, view a man with fresh eyes' perfectly describes you. To think I won't see you for two years... I greatly anticipate how you'll be in two years.”\nIl-mok cupped his fists to the Heavenly Demon.\n\"I'll work hard to live up to your expectations, Master.\"\nBut internally, he was thinking something entirely different.\n'No way in hell am I developing any further in the near future.' Thɪs chapter is updatᴇd by NoveIＦire.net\nThanks to the relentless training he had endured under the Heavenly Demon, Il-mok's realm had risen sharply.\nAlthough the teas and counseling sessions from the Pure Mind Hall had helped mitigate the severity of the side effects, he was far from being in a stable condition.\nFor this reason, Il-mok planned to live lazily for a while, at least until the side effects subsided somewhat.\n‘Since I’m currently ranked first, I’ll take it easy for a while.’\nHiding these thoughts completely, Il-mok bid his farewell with a resolute tone. His Eldest Brother approached him, laughing heartily and patting his shoulder.\n\"Hahaha! I'll lay the groundwork while you're gone, youngest! Just trust this senior brother and focus on your training!\"\nOthers like Third Brother Seo Wan-pyeong, Sixth Brother Jong-ri Chu, and the Demonic Physician also took turns bidding Il-mok farewell.\n\"In two years, I will have become a reliable senior brother you can always depend on.\"\n\"Two years at the Hall of the Demonic Way will pass quickly. Let's meet again soon.\"\n\"Hahaha. Thanks to the foundation laid by the Deputy Master, the Pure Mind Hall will continue to flourish. I look forward to working alongside you again upon your return.\"\nAmidst the celebratory atmosphere, Il-mok approached the only one who radiated a gloomy aura.\nSeon-ah.\n“...Can't you not go?”\nShe looked ready to burst into tears at any moment.\nIl-mok rummaged through his bag and pulled out a small object, holding it out to her.\nIt was a handmade doll with black hair and black clothes, bearing an uncanny resemblance to Il-mok himself.\nSeon-ah stared blankly, alternating her gaze between the doll and Il-mok before carefully reaching out her hands to receive it.\nSeeing how preciously she clutched the doll that resembled him, Il-mok smiled gently and patted her head.\n“Whenever you miss me, look at this doll and wait for me. Two years will pass quickly than you think.”\nThe doll was an idea he'd conceived after the argument with Lady Cheonghwa, back when Seon-a first arrived clutching her \"mother doll.\"\nIt was his answer to Lady Cheonghwa’s question about how he would take responsibility after leaving for the hall.\nTo be precise, it was a solution he could conceive of because, during his time as Seo Ji-hoon, he had experience making a doll, albeit just once.\nHaving worked in the social welfare department, he often handled matters related to volunteer activities. On one occasion, a bizarre project had been approved, requiring social workers and volunteers to each create a doll to donate to an orphanage.\nThanks to that project, he had spent many nights stuffing cotton into dolls and gluing on eyes. He had even considered simply buying a doll and pretending he had made it, but ultimately, he had forced himself to complete the task.\nThat seemingly insignificant experience had unexpectedly proven useful.\n‘Though, in reality, I only managed to complete it properly thanks to Ouyang Mun.’\nWhile secretly making the doll at night, Ouyang Mun, who had been sharing his room as a bodyguard for several months, showed an unexpected interest. Surprisingly, Ouyang Wen had a talent for making dolls—or more accurately, he possessed exceptional dexterity.\n'He's really something. If it weren't for his mess with Jin Hayeon, he would be quite a valuable asset.'\nOuyang Mun, unaware of Il-mok’s inner thoughts, grinned smugly, likely assuming he was being praised.\nHe was a friend deserving of sympathy in many ways.\nAfter comforting Seon-ah, Il-mok approached Ouyang Wen and Jin Hayeon.\n\"Thank you both for helping me all this time, Young Warrior Ouyang, Miss Jin.\"\n\"Hahaha! I was simply doing what I should, Young Master.\"\n\"It was an honor to serve you, Young Master.\"\nOuyang Mun replied in an energetic tone, while Jin Hayeon was in her usual stoic manner.\nAfter bidding farewell to everyone, Il-mok left the Windrock Palace.\nSoon, he arrived at the sprawling training grounds where the entrance exam had been held days prior.\nHe exhaled a sigh before marching to the designated pavilion.\nThis place was a temporary gathering point.\nThis served as a temporary gathering point for the new recruits before their departure to the Hall of the Demonic Way, located on a separate peak of the Tianshan Mountain Range.\nStepping inside, Il-mok surveyed the room and made his way towards an empty seat.\n'Yep. Definitely a mental asylum.’\nA guy is sulking in the corner with a gloomy expression.\nAnother chattered incessantly, brimming with inexplicable excitement.\nAnd another glaring at him with bloodshot eyes.\nNot a single fucking one of them seemed normal.\n'Better not get involved with them.'\nHaving formed his initial assessment of the prospective mental patients, Il-mok sat down.\nEach new recruits stared at the newcomer intently.\nSome stared openly, while others stole furtive glances.\nNone could ignore Il-mok's presence.\n'That's the youngest disciple of the Heavenly Demon.'\n'His aura's extraordinary.'\nTheir interest was understandable.\nIt was only natural. He was, after all, a disciple of the Heavenly Demon, the very god they worshipped.\nBut their interest wasn't purely due to that.\nHe was a martial arts prodigy who had claimed the top seat at the Hall entrance exam after just one year of joining the cult. And if that wasn't enough, within the past year, he had established groundbreaking initiatives like the school program and the Pure Mind Hall.\nRumors even spread that the Heavenly Demon was deliberately propping him up by assigning achievements.\nWith such notoriety, how could these youngsters not be curious about him?\nAnd while everyone's attention was focused on him,\n\"Hmm?\"\nThe Il-mok suddenly tilted his head, stood up, and—\nSwish\n\"Hmm.\"\n—slightly adjusted the table he had been sitting at.\n\"Could you please move over a bit?\"\nHe even went so far as to relocate the neighboring tables and move chairs where people were sitting.\n\"Phew.\"\nOnly after he had perfectly spaced all the furniture did he sigh and return to his seat.\n“Good grief.”\nUpon sitting down, he suddenly frowned and stared at his palm.\nHe immediately rummaged through his baggage, pulled out a soap and a water bottle, applied the soap to his hands, and washed them clean with the water.\n\"Haah.\"\nBy the time Il-mok whistled while looking at his clean hands, a bizarre silence had descended over the pavilion.\n'...He seems to suffer from serious side effects.'\n'They say geniuses are often eccentric, and indeed they are.'\nAt some point, everyone was looking at Il-mok as if he were a madman.\nWhile this awkward atmosphere persisted, a young man who had been glaring daggers at Il-mok since he entered approached him.\nNoticing the movement, Il-mok looked up.\nThe newcomer, who was at least half a head taller than Il-mok and boasted a sturdy physique, declared, \"I may have lost the top seat this time, but it won't be so easy next time!\"\n\"...?\"\nThe first thought that crossed Il-mok's mind was simple.\n'What's with this lunatic?'\nIl-mok's baffled stare seemed to incense the youth further. He boldly spoke again.\n\"I am Dokgo Pae, eldest grandson of the Great Dokgo Family. If you dare, let's settle this right here and now!\"\nIn response to Dokgo Pae's robust declaration of war, Il-mok gave a hollow laugh.\n'Is this some kind of schoolyard bully?'\nCome to think of it, the Hall of the Demonic Way, in modern terms, was essentially a gathering place for kids around high school age.\nThe sight of the eldest grandson of the Dokgo Family, one of the Five Great Families of the Demonic Cult, engaging in such juvenile intimidation was somewhat strange and funny.\n'Hmm. But then again, I recall reading that rich kids tend to be the biggest bullies these days.'\nBut Il-mok had no intention of humoring this young bully.\n\"Do your best to take first next time. Good luck.\"\nIl-mok offered words of encouragement with a bland face.\n\"Are you mocking me right now?\"\nHis bland response only further inflamed Dokgo Pae.\nDokgo Pae flared his fighting spirit as if ready to attack at any moment, while Il-mok still maintained his indifferent attitude. The new recruits gathered in the pavilion watched the two with keen interest.\nJust as the tension peaked and was ready to erupt at any moment—\nSwish.\nThud.\nThe sound of the pavilion door opening and closing broke the mounting tension, and all eyes turned towards the entrance.\nThe newcomer was a man familiar to Il-mok.\nIt was the instructor who had conducted Il-mok's combat test during the Hall entrance examination.\nDokgo Pae clicked his tongue and retreated.\nUnconcerned with the atmosphere, the instructor muttered to himself in a leisurely tone.\n\"One, two, three, four, five... Hmm. All twenty are present.\"\nAfter counting the number of new students in the pavilion, the instructor spoke with the same playful smile as that day.\n\"Welcome. I am Chu Il-hwan, the Head Instructor and Primary Instructor who will oversee your training from today onward.\"\nAs if confirming their faces, he swept his gaze all over the room, making eye contact with each initiate one by one.\nNaturally, during this process, his eyes also met Il-mok's.\nFor some reason, the instructor smiled even more broadly than before.\nShudder\nThe moment he faced that smile, Il-mok felt goosebumps all over his body again. That sensation he'd felt after their combat test had returned.\n'Damn it. Of course, an instructor at the Hall of the Demonic Way couldn't be anything but a lunatic.'\nOnce could be a coincidence, but twice was a pattern.\n'This bastard's side effect is definitely homosexuality.’\nIl-mok vowed to avoid Chu Il-hwan at all costs.\nOblivious to Il-mok's inner thoughts, Chu Il-hwan concluded his brief self-introduction and announced, \"We will now depart for the Hall of the Demonic Way. Follow closely behind me. Lightness skill and tracking are also part of your training.

    "content": "Chapter 58: Mental Asylum (3)\nWatching Chu Il-hwan's retreating back as he sprinted ahead, Il-mok thought to himself, 'At least he's running at a reasonable pace.'\nIt was a much slower movement compared to the blinding speed Chu Ilhwan had shown at the end of the martial arts examination.\nIl-mok maintained a comfortable pace, matching the instructor's speed.\nBut just as they left the main compound and entered the forested area—\nWhoosh!\nChu Il-hwan, who had been running at the front, suddenly increased his speed.\n\"Haah!\"\nThe recruits, caught off guard, hastened their pace to keep up. The group, which had been moving as a cohesive unit, began to split into those who were pulling ahead and those who were falling behind.\nIn the midst of this—\n\"Let's see if you can beat me this time!\"\nDokgo Pae suddenly shot past Il-mok, provoking Il-mok as he did that.\nWatching Dokgo Pae’s figure gradually pull ahead, Il-mok shook his head.\n'The folly of youth.'\nIl-mok had no intention of competing with Dokgo Pae. In fact, he had no intention of exerting himself at all.\n'Sweating is disgusting.'\nThis aversion stemmed from the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\nAs his realm rose rapidly, subtle compulsive symptoms had begun to appear one after another. One of these was a heightened awareness of cleanliness.\nThankfully, the symptom is still light. He wasn't at the point of bathing all day or washing his hands constantly after touching anything.\nHowever, prolonged contact with objects or perspiration often triggered an incessant itch of discomfort at the back of his mind.\nThat was why he had washed his hands after rearranging the tables in the pavilion.\nSo Il-mok maintained just enough speed to avoid breaking a sweat as he executed his movement technique.\nIt pushed him to the back of the pack, but he didn’t care.\nAlthough the dense foliage obscured Chu Il-hwan from view, he could still see the students ahead of him.\nHe didn’t know how long he had been running while staring at the back of whoever was ahead of him.\n\"Huff... huff...\"\nThose who had recklessly chased Chu Il-hwan or tried too hard to improve their rank began to slow down one by one as their internal energy or stamina depleted.\nIl-mok, having started near the back, gradually overtook them one by one while still maintaining his moderate pace.\nAfter running for about two hours, they arrived before a massive gate bearing the plaque of the Hall of the Demonic Way hanging above it.\nIl-mok finished somewhere in the middle of the pack.\n\"Huff... huff...\"\nWhile those who had arrived before Il-mok and those who arrived after him were all gasping for breath—\n\"Tsk.\"\nIl-mok clicked his tongue as he wiped the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand.\nNo matter how casually he had run, running continuously for over two hours would inevitably cause him to sweat.\nJust then, Dokgo Pae approached Il-mok who was frowning.\n\"Huff... I... huff... came in first... huff...\"\nSeeing him trying hard to look dignified while his face was deathly pale as if about to vomit any second, Il-mok gave a dry laugh and replied, \"Congratulations. Keep up the good work.\"\nIl-mok didn’t want to get entangled with a potential madman, so he tried to slip away after offering a casual congratulation, but—\n\"Huff... Are you... huff... ignoring me again?\"\nIl-mok's indifferent attitude seemed to flame Dokgo Pae’s temper again. Even while still gasping for breath, he still insisted on picking a fight again.\nIl-mok frowned at the alarming sight.\n\"You’re going to puke at this rate. Calm your breathing first.\"\nHe was already disgusted by his own sweat; who knows what would happen if some vomit splashed on his face or clothes?\n\"Gah!! I’ll wipe that smug look off your face! Haah—urk!\"\nDokgo Pae was about to erupt in rage when a wave of nausea cut his anger short.\n\"Urgh.\"\nIl-mok grimaced and stepped back, narrowly avoiding disaster.\n\"Phew.\"\nWhile the debacle between the two passed—\n\"Huff... huff...\"\nThe remaining recruits began to arrive at the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nSoon after,\nThe last recruit stumbled through the gate before collapsing to the ground with a thud and emptying their stomach.\nChu Il-hwan, who’d been waiting at the gate with a smile, ignored the grotesque scene entirely.\n\"Fortunately, there seems to be no dropouts. Now, let's begin the entrance ceremony.\"\nChu Il-hwan turned around and walked past the entrance, and the recruits followed his lead.\n\"Huff... huff...\"\nEven the recruit who had thoroughly emptied their stomach staggered to follow.\nNot wanting to jostle against the sweat-drenched crowd, Il-mok hung back and entered last.\n'I could tell from the walls, but this place is huge.'\nThe first things he saw were a sprawling training ground and rows of strange equipment that reminded him oddly of military drills from his past life.\nIt was impressive that such a large facility had been built in the heart of a mountain. Thıs text ıs hosted at novel-fire.net\nChu Il-hwan led the recruits to the center of the training ground and turned to face them. \"The Hall Master will address you shortly. Line up in ranks and files.\"\nThe disciples moved in unison to form neat lines.\nStanding in formation, they took advantage of the brief respite to catch their breath.\nBy the time the disciples had more or less caught their breath, an elderly man with a dignified aura began walking out from the pavilion beyond the training field.\nThough his long hair and beard were entirely white, and the wrinkles on his face made him appear elderly, his sturdy physique, upright gait, and imposing presence radiated an aura that could hardly be called ‘old.’\nThe man stopped at a distance before the new recruits and spoke firmly.\n\"I am pleased to meet the talents who’ll shape the future of our cult.\"\nSeveral enthusiastic recruits responded with a resounding shout, \"It is an honor to meet you, Hall Master!\"\nThe Hall Master of the Hall of the Demonic Way, Yeom Ga-hwi.\nIt was a name Il-mok had heard numerous times while preparing to enter the Hall.\nHe was a man famous for his uncompromising character and principles; a man who had mastered the Shura Blood Fist and achieved Transcendence in that Demonic Art. Before taking his post as the Hall Master of the Hall of the Demonic Way, he had roamed the Central Plains and Xinjiang, slaying countless villains with his bare hands, earning him the moniker Fist Demon.\nMore importantly, having achieved Transcendence, he was arguably the only sane person in the entire Hall of the Demonic Way.\nBut Il-mok did not let his guard down.\n‘Achieving Transcendence just means overcoming mental illness. It does not equate him with being a benevolent person.’\nTake his Master and Seol-ah’s grandfather, for example; they were the kind of people who could be called stubborn old fogeys.\nGiven his reputation for unwavering character, he might be an even more obstinate person than they are.\n'…If he’s more of a hardass than Master, this speech might drag on forever.'\nBracing for a lecture, Il-mok stood stiffly and pretended to listen to his speech.\n\"…Lastly, keep in mind that your previous status before entering the Hall is completely irrelevant. All cadets are equal. Your performance here alone will determine your standing.\"\nSurprisingly, Yeom Ga-hwi concluded his speech in less than fifteen minutes.\n‘…Maybe the biggest hardass in this cult is actually Master.'\nAs Il-mok mused, the Hall Master turned around and left as his speech concluded.\nChu Il-hwan bowed respectfully to the departing Hall Master, then turned to address the recruits.\n“I will now lead you to the Black Dragon Pavilion where you all will stay for the next two years.”\nChu Il-hwan led the group westward.\nThey arrived at a manor with a plaque bearing the words Black Dragon Pavilion.\n\"New cadets, this will be your home. Each room has a name written on the door. Go and unpack your belongings. Also—\"\nHe informed them about the training grounds for personal practice, meal times, and other logistics.\n\"Since today’s your first day, rest until dinner at the Hour of the Rooster (酉時, 5-7 PM).\"\nWith those final words, Chu Il-hwan turned and left the Black Dragon Pavilion.\nOr so it seemed.\nAfter putting a distance, Chu Il-hwan deployed his concealment technique and turned back to the Black Dragon Pavilion.\nIt was one of the traditions of the Hall of the Demonic Way. Providing rest on the first day of entrance.\nBut the purpose wasn't really to provide rest.\nThe Hall of the Demonic Way was filled with young and ambitious individuals. No matter how the instructors had graded the entrance assessment, there were bound to be some who refused to accept their ranking.\nIn a nutshell, this rest time wasn’t for rest. It was a time for establishing hierarchy.\nIt’s not just Chu Il-hwan who had secretly infiltrated the Black Dragon Pavilion; the other instructors, too, had joined in the fray.\nOne of the reasons was to prevent anyone from dying; the other was to properly assess the abilities of these youngsters.\nAnd the target Chu Il-hwan chose to observe was none other than Il-mok.\n\"Urgh.\"\nA sudden chill wracked Il-mok's body as he was unpacking his belongings.\n\"A cold?\"\nNow he wondered if it wasn't a crisis of his chastity but simply a cold.\nJust then—\nBang!\n\"I challenge you to a duel!\"\nIl-mok sighed as Dokgo Pae had violently flung the door open to challenge him.\n'I figured as much.'\nHe’d heard about this sorting tradition from Jin Hayeon and Ouyang Mun.\nBut for Il-mok, bathing his sweat-drenched body was more important than a trivial hierarchy. He had no particular interest in duels right now.\n\"Congratulations, you’ve won.\"\nEven after Il-mok conceded the duel, Dokgo’s face flushed crimson as he drew his sword.\n\"Grrr! If that’s how you’ll be, I won’t hold back! Fight me here or step outside!\"\nIl-mok realized he had no choice.\nFighting here would ruin his precious resting space. Since he couldn’t tolerate a messy room, he had no choice but to go outside.\nNews of the impending duel between the top two recruits spread like wildfire.\nIl-mok and Dokgo Pae faced each other in a small training area at the center of the Black Dragon Pavilion. Some recruits gathered in the courtyard, while others observed from inside their rooms, peering through the windows.\nUnbothered by being a spectacle, Dokgo Pae drew his sword and charged straight at Il-mok.\n\"Raaah!\"\nTrained in his family's Demonic Art, the Nine Swords of Dokgo, Dokgo Pae unleashed a relentless barrage of powerful attacks with no regard for defense.\n(TL Note: Dokgo = Dugu. The Nine Swords of Dokgo is a fictional sword art created by Dugu Qiubai, one of the legendary characters created by the OG of the Wuxia genre, Jin Yong.)\nMany of the onlookers were awed or intimidated by Dokgo Pae's ferocious aura and overwhelming offensive.\n'As expected of the Dokgo Family’s eldest grandson.'\n'How’s someone this strong only second place?'\n'...Judging by the earlier lightness skill test, the Eighth Young Master might actually lose.'\nWhile the spectators had their own thoughts...\nIl-mok, caught in the eye of the storm, barely managed to block or evade the onslaught.\nOr so it seemed.\nIn reality, his thoughts were quite different.\n'Huh? This is it?'\nIn truth, Il-mok was on the verge of a nervous breakdown just thinking about duels or life-or-death battles.\nMonths of relentless training under his master had taken their toll. To be precise, it wasn't the duels he feared, but the enlightenment that came after them.\nEach sparring session with his Master had resulted in a significant increase in his skill and, in turn, worsened the side effect of his Demonic Art.\nBut the situation was different now.\n'Enlightenment or not, there needs to be at least some genuine threat for me to gain anything.'\nIl-mok, who had been passively deflecting and evading Dokgo Pae's attacks, breathed a sigh of relief.\nSince this guy was ranked second after him, there shouldn't be anyone stronger than him in this place.\nWhich meant—\n'Even if I duel with other guys, the chance of enlightenment is low!'\nIt meant there was no reason to avoid duels anymore.\n\"!?\"\nSensing a sudden shift in Il-mok's demeanor, Dokgo Pae's eyes widened in alarm.\nBut Dokgo Pae realized the change too late.\nClang!\nDokgo Pae's sword, upon clashing with Il-mok's, was abruptly twisted aside as if caught by a phantom hand.\nWhoosh!\nBefore anyone could follow it with their eyes, Il-mok's swift sword was already at Dokgo Pae's throat.\nHaving subdued Dokgo Pae with a single counterattack, Il-mok smiled.\n\"Your realm is better than I expected!”\nThough his words were meant as genuine praise, Dokgo Pae’s face turned beet red, as if about to explode.",

    "content": "Chapter 59: Mental Asylum (4)\nDokgo Pae, misinterpreting Il-mok's compliment as sarcasm, shouted with a reddened face. \"Gah! Just you wait!!\"\nAs Il-mok chuckled at the utterly clichéd line, Dokgo Pae turned and stormed back to his room.\nAfter a moment of contemplation, Il-mok shrugged and returned to his own quarters.\n‘Well, at least he’ll stay quiet out of shame for a while.’\nHe decided to consider it a blessing in disguise.\n‘My stuff’s mostly unpacked, and there’s time before dinner. Might as well wash up.’\nThe lightness skill training and the duel with Dokgo Pae left an unpleasant stickiness covering his entire body.\nGrabbing fresh clothes, he stepped out—only to nearly collide with a spear-carrying woman.\n'Isn't that the one who was throwing up earlier?'\nShe was the underachiever who had arrived last at the Hall and immediately started with a bout of vomiting.\n\"Haa.\"\nIl-mok sighed, thinking that even this underachiever wanted to duel with him.\nWhile he now knew fighting these cadets wouldn’t trigger another wave of enlightenment, it was still a hassle.\nAnd right now, bathing took priority.\n‘Let's pretend I didn't see her.’\nHe tried to ignore the woman right in front of him and walk past, but she smiled brightly and spoke to him.\n\"I saw your duel, Young Master! You were amazing!\"\n\"…We’re equals here. No need for honorifics.\"\n“Don’t sweat the small details, Young Master. I never imagined you would defeat the Dokgo Family’s eldest grandson so easily.\"\n\"Is that so?\"\nIl-mok gave a half-hearted response and quickened his pace to escape this situation. But she persistently followed, chattering away without pause.\nAs he walked while trying his best to ignore her, Il-mok belatedly realized something strange about her. Besides her initial comment about Dokgo Pae, she hadn't mentioned a single word about the duel.\nInstead —\n\"By the way, I heard that Young Master's maid is named Jin Hayeon.\"\n\"They say she’s breathtakingly beautiful—is it true?\"\n\"Do you know what kind of food she likes?\"\nThe longer she spoke, the more frequently Jin Hayeon was mentioned. Intrigued by this odd behavior, Il-mok turned and faced her directly.\n“Young Master! I plan to go to the Hidden Guard Pavilion after graduating from the Hall. Please accept me as your maidservant and Miss Jin Hayeon's junior!\"\nThe woman’s eyes sparkled with a manic glint as she said this.\nAnd Il-mok recognized that look.\n'...Was it back in university?'\nHe had a classmate from university, who normally gave the impression of being plain and modest, but he'd had one shocking experience with her. During a casual conversation in the department lounge, the topic of a particular idol group came up. Her pupils dilated, and she’d launched a speech befitting that of a zealot.\nAnd the look in the eyes of this woman talking about Jin Hayeon right now was exactly the same as that female classmate.\nIl-mok realized instinctively.\n‘She is the same breed as Ouyang Mun.’\nDo talkative and energetic people generally pick women like Jin Ha-yeon as their ideal type?\nAmusingly, the fact that this admirer was a woman hardly seemed worth noting.\nHow to put it—\n‘Hmm… Actually, her odds might be better.’\nThe chance of Jin Hayeon being into women seemed higher than her ever reciprocating Ouyang Mun’s feelings.\nThe possibility that Jin Hayeon might be interested in women seemed at least higher than the possibility she would ever fancy Ouyang Mun.\nBut that was the extent of Il-mok's interest.\nRight now, he had more pressing matters.\nAfter continuing to walk while enduring her chatter for a while longer, Il-mok finally turned to her with an awkward expression.\n\"Would you mind leaving now?\"\nAs he said this, he pointed to the bathhouse entrance right in front of them. \"I'd like to take a bath.\"\nBut instead of leaving, the madness in her eyes intensified as she replied, \"Don't mind me, Young Master! Gender is irrelevant to a martial artist! Besides, once I become your maidservant after graduating from the Hall, attending to your bathing needs will be part of my duties. There's no need for modesty!\"\n\"...But I find it uncomfortable.\"\n\"It’s fine! I have zero interest in men anyway!\"\n\"......\"\nIl-mok felt a headache coming on.\nMiss Jin, seems you’ve got another lunatic incoming.’\nFor the first time, he almost pitied Jin Hayeon.\nAlmost.\nMeanwhile, several hours earlier.\nAfter Il-mok's departure from Windrock Palace, the others who had gathered there gradually dispersed.\nOnly Jin Hayeon remained alone in the Windrock Palace, sighing as she took in the scenery.\n‘Pathetic.’\nMemories of her repeated failures to protect Il-mok weighed heavily in her mind.\nJust then, a woman entered Windrock Palace.\nStartled by the sudden presence, Jin Hayeon turned and quickly bowed upon recognizing the woman's face.\n“Greetings, First Squad Leader.”\nThe First Squad Leader of the Hidden Guard Pavilion, Dam Bin, was a figure of immense authority for Jin Hayeon.\n\"How was your year serving the Eighth Young Master?\"\nTam Bin asked in a voice that, while not intimidating, carried an air of dignity.\nJin Hayeon, adopting a formal tone befitting a report to a superior, recounted the events that had transpired and her own feelings about them.\nWhile she spoke of her feelings, her report was devoid of emotion.\n\"I dedicated myself wholeheartedly to serving the cult, but watching the Young Master made me realize. Brute force alone can only carry you so far. I never once thought about matters such as the school program or the Pure Mind Hall. Instead of contemplating matters that benefitted the cult, I focused solely on improving my martial arts skills.\"\n“On the day the first assassin infiltrated, I understood how naive I’d been.\"\nShe objectively described Il-mok's remarkable feats, his occasional laziness, and admitted her own shortcomings without filtering anything.\nHer dispassionate account continued for a while.\n\"Far from being worthy to serve the Heavenly Demon, I felt I was still woefully inadequate even to serve the Young Master.\"\nWhen Jin Hayeon finished her self-reflection, Dam Bin nodded with an impassive face.\n“It’s fortunate that you are able to recognize your own flaw. Only by acknowledging our flaws can we strive to improve.”\n\"I will devote myself fully to my training.\"\nDam Bin nodded at her resolute answer.\n\"This is the Heavenly Demon's command. From now on, I will personally oversee your training. Dedicate your heart and soul to improve.”\nA flicker of surprise appeared in Jin Hayeon’s eyes before quickly vanishing.\n'When the Young Master returns in two years, I will not disappoint him.'\nShe bowed deeply, and she responded with her characteristic emotionless tone, \"I will follow your command with my life.\"\nMeanwhile, around the same time.\nSwoosh!\nIn a training ground of the Hyeokryeon family, a young girl emanating a red aura around her darted back and forth, her hands a blur of motion.\nCrack!\nThe red energy swirling around her fingertips cut through and pierced the wooden dummies, producing a series of chilling sounds.\nHidden behind a wall, a woman and an elderly man secretly observed the young girl's vigorous training. They were Seon-ah’s mother and grandfather.\nWith complex expressions mixing worry and relief, affection and sorrow, they watched Seon-ah train.\nOnly when Seon-ah stopped her movements and assumed the lotus position did the two sigh in relief.\n\"There are no signs of Qi Deviation.\"\n\"Fortunately, our immediate concerns seem unfounded, Family Head.\"\nIn truth, both had been too worried to sleep properly since the previous night. For nearly a year, the family’s precious jewel had spent nearly every waking moment with the youngest disciple of the Heavenly Demon.\nAlthough limited to two hours each day, it had been a significant concession for the Hyeokryeon Family. It was a time when she should have been forming attachments to objects or dolls, yet they had allowed her to develop a bond with a person.\nAnd the person to whom their precious jewel had formed the deepest attachment had now left for two years.\nConsidering the potential side effects of the Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art, their worry was understandable.\nHowever, the child had shown no signs of distress upon returning to the family.\nNo, far from having breakdowns, the child who returned to the family had simply woken at dawn and trained harder than ever.\n\"Whew.\"\nWatching his granddaughter rise again and resume practicing the Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art, Hyeokryeon Cheon-gang pondered.\n'I don't know what kind of trick he used, but I must acknowledge his influence.'\nThat the youngest young master was truly someone beneficial to his granddaughter.\nLater that night.\nAfter four hours of grueling training and study, Hyeokryeon Seon-ah, after cleansing her body, headed to her room.\nThe door was unusual, to say the least.\nIt was sealed with locks and wire, and the atmosphere surrounding the room made it as though something dangerous was sealed within.\nClick.\nSeon-ah unlocked the padlock with a key she kept in her sleeve and entered the room.\nThen, after closing the door, she used the locks and wire she had brought to secure the room from the inside.\nShe cautiously approached a large wardrobe in a corner of the room.\nMoving aside the clothes and blankets inside, she took out a hidden wooden box. She retrieved another key from her sleeve and carefully opened the wooden box.\nThis box held the items she had received from Il-mok, each one treasured and kept secret. The most prominent item in the box was, of course, the doll that resembled Il-mok.\nShe carefully took out the stuffed doll as if she were handling a sacred artefact and then held it close as if she would never let it go. Googlᴇ search novęlfire.net\nHyeokryeon Cheon-gang, Lady Cheonghwa, and even Il-mok himself were all mistaken.\nShe hadn't overcome the pain of Il-mok's absence. She was simply wise beyond her years.\nInstead of just whining, she had tried to find a solution.\nAnd the solution the young girl came up with was simple.\n‘Big Brother left because I’m weak.’\nIt was a solution befitting a member of the Demonic Cult.\n‘I’ll become stronger. Strong enough to protect him. In two years, no one will take him from me.’\nStroking the doll’s head, Seon-ah's pupils and hair burned redder than ever.\n\"Ugh.\"\nIl-mok, who had returned to his room after bathing and having dinner, rubbed his arms against a sudden chill.\n‘Did I catch a cold?’\nThis was the third chill he had experienced today. The signs weren't good at all.\n'Well, I'll just write this down and get some sleep.'\nDipping his brush into the prepared ink, Il-mok began to write neatly in a blank book.\nIl-mok dipped his brush in the prepared ink and neatly wrote in a blank book. Like leaving the first footprints on an untouched, snow-white field,\n—Day 1 in the Mental Asylum.\n—As expected, there are only lunatics here.\n—From a gay instructor, a high school bully, and even an idol stalker. Just imagining how many more lunatics I’ll meet makes my head ache.\nIl-mok was trampling the pristine snow field with anger and malice.",

    "content": "Chapter 60: Laziness (1)\nEarly the next morning.\n\"Phew. Thankfully, I didn't catch a cold.\"\nAfter a quick self-check, an odd feeling crept over me.\n\"Guess this is what they mean by you don’t know what you have until it’s gone.\"\nIt was the moment I truly felt Jin Hayeon's absence.\nShe used to prepare water for washing my face and hands, and bring breakfast as soon as I woke up.\nAlthough I had lived my entire life without anyone's service in my past life, I had somehow become accustomed to Jin Hayeon's care in just one year.\nShaking off this unnecessary sense of loss, I rose from my bed and headed to the bathhouse.\nAfter a quick wash, I went to the dining hall to get breakfast.\nObviously, I had no intention of socializing.\n'What's the point of hanging out with those lunatics?'\nRight after quickly finishing my meal and returning to my room, I sat on the bed to rest.\nNormally, Jin Hayeon’s nagging would’ve forced me to practice my breathing exercise.\n“It’s more peaceful without her around.”\nMy appreciation for her instantly morphed into a nagging person.\nAs I enjoyed my peaceful moments, the distant sound of a bell jolted me to action. This update ıs available on NoveIꜰire.net\nIt was the signal for the first class at the Hall of the Demonic Way.\n\"Huaaahm.\"\nA yawn escaped my mouth as I arrived at the class. Excluding myself, there are already nine people gathered in there, all with tense expressions.\nThese were the top ten students from the Hall of the Demonic Way entrance examination, Members of the so-called ‘Upper Class’ of the Hall, including myself.\nGlare\nAmong them was Dokgo Pae, glaring at me as if his gaze could kill me.\nI ignored him and casually scanned the other present and realized something very important.\n'As expected, that woman isn't here.'\nI suspected as much from seeing her result on the lightness skill test yesterday. She’s probably in the Lower Class.\n'Good things, I won't have to deal with her during the day.'\nJust as I was sighing with relief, an increasingly familiar mischievous-looking face of a certain instructor appeared.\nSomehow, I felt like he was smiling at me again. My hair stood on its end and I subtly moved behind the other recruits.\nChu Il-hwan glanced over the assembled students and said, \"Hmm. Thankfully, we have no fools who are late or lost on the first day. We already exchanged greetings yesterday, so I'll skip the introductions. I will be in charge of your martial arts training. Now, you're probably wondering...\"\nHe paused dramatically.\n\"...how can I possibly teach ten students with varying martial arts backgrounds?\"\nSome nodded in agreement, while others simply stared at Chu Il-hwan with serious expressions.\n“That would be true if you were fledglings learning martial arts for the first time. However, this is the Hall of the Demonic Way, a place that selects and nurtures talents who will lead our Divine Cult. It means this isn't a place where we teach everything from the basics. So, how do you think the training will proceed?”\nChu Il-hwan posed a serious question before falling silent.\nA moment of silence hung over the training ground.\nA fellow in the front row who gave off a military vibe raised his hand and shouted.\n\"You’ll observe our forms and correct flaws, sir!\"\n\"Hah! Half-right. But do you think we’d just watch demonstrations here?\"\nThis time, a fellow whose name I knew raised his hand.\nIt was Dokgo Pae.\n\"I believe you'll observe combat between disciples and then point out our flaws!\"\n\"Hahaha. Correct! I'll award you both extra points.\"\nAs soon as Chu Il-hwan finished speaking, a young martial artist standing behind him diligently jotted something down on a piece of paper.\nAs soon as Chu Ilhwan's clear voice ended, a young warrior standing behind him scribbled something on a small piece of paper he had brought.\nApparently, that young warrior was an assistant instructor.\nDokgo Pae raised his hand again. \"I have a question, Instructor!\"\n\"Speak.\"\n\"Can we choose our opponents for the duels?\"\nThough he was speaking to Chu Il-hwan, his eyes were already directed at me.\n'Haah. Doesn't he ever get tired of this?'\nAs I sighed inwardly, Instructor Chu Il-hwan answered the question.\n“Your combat opponents will be chosen by me. Also, starting today, unauthorized combat without an instructor or assistant present will be prohibited. Violating that rule will result in your points being deducted.”\nFor once, I felt a surge of gratitude to this dubious instructor.\n'Great! Now I can just laze around!'\nWhile I was inwardly shouting with joy, Dokgo Pae couldn't hide his sour expression and exclaimed.\n\"But why, Instructor?!\"\n“Because you are still fledglings. We can’t let those who will lead our Divine Cult in the future waste their talent and future because they end up dead or become crippled from reckless combat.”\n\"But—\"\n\"Enough. One more word, and it’s penalties. If you really want to duel someone outside of the teaching hours, find an instructor or an assistant instructor to officiate your duel.”\nWhen the usually smiling Chu Il-hwan became serious, Dokgo Pae had no choice but to shut his mouth.\n'...What a half-assed fellow.'\nA true delinquent would defy even teachers if they're going to act up. He was oddly obedient to the instructor's words.\nIn any case, thanks to Dokgo Pae's shutting up, the lesson went smoothly.\nInstructor Chu Il-hwan called out the names of two recruits, and they stepped forward to duel.\nHe observed quietly when the duels proceeded normally, but if a recruit was in danger of serious injury, he would swiftly intervene.\nClang!!\nAs one disciple's spear was about to pierce another disciple's side, Chu Il-hwan launched himself to block it and said.\n\"This is precisely why duels are only permitted under supervision. Understood?\"\n\"Yes, Instructor!\"\nAnd after each match, Chu Il-hwan would offer advice based on the capabilities they had demonstrated.\n\"Your martial art emphasizes the principle of strength, doesn't it? In such cases, you should overwhelm your opponent with a greater force rather than forcibly altering your trajectory and losing your momentum.”\n\"The transition between these two techniques is somewhat awkward. This is less about insight and more about your body not being able to handle it. Focus on honing your body for a while.”\nLike a master tutor pinpointing issues precisely, the disciples couldn't help but feel awe at Chu Il-hwan's explanations.\nEveryone except me.\n‘Fucking lunatic!'\nI couldn't help but frown every time Chu Il-hwan touched a male recruit under the guise of providing guidance.\nWhile I silently debated whether or not to report Chu Il-hwan's sexual harassment—\nI missed the match's ending.\nOnly two disciples, including myself, remained.\nI thought it was finally my turn to duel, but I was mistaken.\n\"Disciple Il-mok will spar with the assistant instructor.\"\n\"!?\"\nWhile I was staring in disbelief, someone else tried to protest first.\n\"Why does he—\"\nBut before Dokgo Pae could finish his sentence, Chu Il-hwan's cold glare shut his mouth.\n'Good thing I didn't speak up.'\nWhile I wasn't thrilled about sparring with the assistant instructor, I was grateful that Dokgo Pae had unwittingly stepped into the trap first, sparing me from the same fate.\nI reluctantly faced the assistant. He was a man in his late twenties, a warrior of the cult who cultivated a saber art.\n\"Begin.\"\nAs soon as Chu Il-hwan gave the order, the assistant quickly closed the distance between us and executed iaido.\nSwish\nThat single strike was enough for me to gauge the characteristics of his martial art.\n'A martial art that emphasizes speed, is it?'\nStepping back and narrowly dodging the first attack, I effortlessly drew my sword and counterattacked.\nClang!\nThe assistant also easily blocked my initial strike and unleashed a flurry of attacks.\nClang!\nClang!!\nThe more I blocked or dodged, the faster the assistant's saber blurred.\nWhen I finished assessing his strength, I got a rough idea of where he stood.\n'Similar to Jin Hayeon's level... I think?'\nIt was hard to gauge who was stronger, but in terms of realm, they are roughly on par.\nTo be precise, he is comparable to the current Jin Hayeon, whose realm improved after overcoming Qi Deviation triggered by Ouyang Mun’s confession attack.\nAccording to her, my current state is roughly on par with hers when we first met.\nKnowing her personality, she wouldn't exaggerate this just to flatter me.\nAdding a few facts I knew to this observation, I was able to realize one very important truth.\nThe first day Ouyang Mun came knocking at the Windrock Palace, he had said that her skills hadn’t improved much since graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nWhat's important here is that Jin Hayeon graduated from the Hall as the second in her year.\nIn other words.\n‘Even if I were to graduate from the Hall right now, I’d be at least second at the top.’\nOf course, there was a flaw in this logic: the skill level of graduating classes wasn't consistent every year.\nBut yesterday’s duel had eliminated that concern.\n'If someone like him is second place, I don't need to worry about falling behind anytime soon.'\nThanks to reaching this amazing conclusion, I established guidelines for my remaining time in this den of madmen.\n'I'll spend the first year resting and managing my side effects. In the second year, I'll train just enough to barely maintain first place and graduate!'\nI wanted to play around for both years, but the damn tradition was the problem.\nThat outdated tradition demanded that every single disciple of the Heavenly Demon had graduated from the hall as the top seat.\nAdditionally, to play around and eat for the first year, a very important prerequisite was needed.\nI couldn't let anyone discover my laziness.\nI was, after all, the Heavenly Demon's disciple.\nA position that required being a role model for others. Failure to do so could result in getting my head chopped off by Jin Hayeon or my Master.\nThen, how could I pretend to be working hard while lazing around all year?\nSwish!\nAs the assistant’s blade nearly grazed my face, I realized that this was the turning point of my life in this mental asylum.\nI blocked or dodged the swift saber strikes the assistant relentlessly poured down dozens of times.\nSeeing his attacks having no effect whatsoever, the assistant began to increase his speed even further.\nOnce the assistant’s saber blurred to a certain level\nOnce the assistant's quick dao became faster than a certain level—\nThud!!\n\"Ugh.\"\nStaring at the saber now pressed against my neck, I put on a frustrated face.\nSecret Technique: Young Master Low-key Hiding His Strength.\nStart by hiding your actual skills, then gradually reveal your true abilities, pretending that your skills are improving without actually training.\nNo matter how I thought about it, there couldn't be a more perfect plan.\n'It didn't work with my senior brother and Master, but please, let it work this time!'\nI silently prayed, desperately trying to suppress the corners of my mouth from twitching upwards.",

    "content": "Chapter 61: Laziness (2)\nAfter the sparring match between Il-mok and the assistant instructor ended.\nThose who had been watching displayed a variety of expressions.\n'I felt it when he subdued Dokgo Pae, but he truly is on a different level.’\n‘Still… at that level, it’s a gap that can be closed with just a bit more effort!’\nAlthough Il-mok had lost to the assistant instructor, the disciples of the Hall considered his skills to be sufficiently impressive.\nTherefore, no one suspected that Il-mok had intentionally lost to conceal his true abilities.\nExcept for one person.\n'Hehehe. As expected, he's quite the amusing fellow.'\nChu Il-hwan, who had sparred with Il-mok during the entrance examination, had vaguely sensed Il-mok's true capabilities.\nThat was precisely why he had deliberately paired Il-mok with the assistant instructor. He knew that among the disciples, there was no one here who could draw out Il-mok's true abilities.\nTo think he would hide his skills even during the match with the assistant instructor. And by deliberately losing, no less.\nIt was an unconventional tactic, one rarely seen among the members of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, who revered martial prowess.\nHowever, despite noticing this fact, Chu Il-hwan chose not to point it out.\n‘I’d love to crack his skull open to see what schemes he’s hiding in there.’\nThere was no need to share something that piqued his interest with others.\nChu Il-hwan almost unconsciously licked his lips, a bad habit he exhibited when overcome with the urge to kill.\n'Phew. I made the right choice leaving it to Assistant Instructor Jang.'\nHad he personally sparred with Il-mok, he might have succumbed to his murderous impulses and put a hole in the boy's head.\nSuppressing his urge, Chu Il-hwan beamed at Il-mok. \"Hahaha! As expected of Disciple Il-mok! To last that long against the assistant instructor!\"\nAt Chu Il-hwan's first-ever praise, the other disciples who were receiving training together looked at Il-mok with a mixture of envy, admiration, and jealousy in their eyes.\nOn the other hand, Il-mok was letting out a sigh of relief.\n'Whew. Since he's only praising me, does that mean he was fooled? Then, he probably won’t touch me either, right?’\nBut as if dashing Il-mok’s hopes, Chu Il-hwan approached him with a smirk.\n\"However, your sword movements still lack fluidity. First, your wrist—\"\nWatching Chu Il-hwan’s hand reach for his wrist, Il-mok shuddered.\nAfter two hours of martial arts training under Chu Il-hwan, it was followed by another two hours of physical conditioning conducted by another instructor.\nOnly after those gruelling trainings ended were the disciples given a one-hour break for lunch.\nDuring this lunch break, several of Il-mok's fellow Upper Class disciples attempted to approach him.\nThey weren't seeking duels like Dokgo Pae.\nAfter all, they had become fellow disciples with a disciple of the Heavenly Demon, so there were many who wanted to build rapport.\nHowever, as they approached him, Il-mok abruptly headed off in a direction other than the dining hall.\n\"Eighth Young Master, how about having a meal together?\"\n“Becoming classmates at the Hall like this is also fate, so how about we chat a little?”\nBut Il-mok, without even stopping, quickly replied and swiftly left the scene.\n\"I'm sorry. I have business at the Black Dragon Pavilion, go ahead and eat without me!\"\nAs Il-mok swiftly declined their invitations and disappeared, some looked slightly offended, while others simply shrugged and headed towards the dining hall.\nAmong them, three people, driven by curiosity, followed Il-mok toward the Black Dragon Pavilion.\nWhat reason could the Heavenly Demon’s disciple have for rushing back to the Black Dragon Pavilion so urgently?\nWhat they saw was Il-mok grabbing a bundle of clothes from his room before sprinting toward the bathhouse at breakneck speed.\n\"...Why is he going to the bathhouse?\"\n\"To wash, obviously?\"\n\"That's what's strange. There's training again in the afternoon, so why bathe now?\"\nIn the midst of their confusion, one of them murmured as if he had realized something.\n\"...Could it be, he wet himself?\"\n\"Wet what?\"\n\"Just now. When the assistant instructor's saber touched his neck.\"\n\"Ah!!\"\nThough they found it hard to believe, the one on the right suddenly recalled something and exclaimed.\n\"Come to think of it, I think the Eighth Young Master was trembling after the duel.\"\n\"Hahaha! So that's why he rushed here even when we tried to talk to him!\"\n\"The Heavenly Demon’s youngest disciple, a piss-pants! What an era we live in. Heh heh.\"\nIt was a misunderstanding that if Il-mok had heard, he would’ve frothed at the mouth—this was a complete misunderstanding.\nOn the way out of the Black Dragon Pavilion after a thorough wash, he hummed to himself cheerfully.\n\"Hmm~\"\nWashing off the sweat had calmed his mind.\nEven though more training was scheduled for the afternoon, the thought of eating while drenched in sweat was horrifying.\nMoreover, having had his wrist subjected to Chu Il-hwan’s molestation, he felt the urge to wash it off immediately.\nIn addition to that.\n‘Eating surrounded by stinking brutes? Disgusting. Ugh.’\nBy the time he finished bathing, the others would’ve already eaten, leaving the dining hall clean and peaceful.\nIt was truly a win-win situation.\nAnd upon arriving at the dining hall, his prediction was confirmed.\nThe disciples had already finished their meals and left, making the place impressively serene.\n'Hmm. There's still a slight scent of sweat lingering, but it's tolerable.'\nIf it was this level of smell after everyone had left, he dreaded to think what it would have been like if he had come to eat with them—He probably would have thrown up right there.\nWith the sensation of having the dining hall all to myself, I gathered some food, placed it on the table, and started enjoying my meal in a peaceful state of mind.\nJust as he took his first few bites, three men entered the dining hall and approached the table where he was sitting.\n\"Ugggh.\"\nThe thick stench of sweat hit him mid-bite, making him gag..\n'Damn. Was this the kind of smell coming from my body until just now?'\nHis stomach churned, his face twisting into disgust as he addressed them.\n\"I'd like to eat alone, so would you please leave?\"\nMaybe they took his words as a dismissal, because the smiles on their faces as they approached quickly twisted into scowls.\nBut the nausea he felt made him care less about their distorted expressions.\nThe problem was their lingering presence and the absurd words that spewed from their mouths.\n\"Even if you’re the Heavenly Demon’s disciple, isn’t this too much disrespect?\"\n\"Hmph. If word gets out that the Heavenly Demon’s disciple wet his pants, it would cause quite a stir. Kuhehe.\"\n\"…What the hell are you talking about?\"\nIl-mok was too stunned by their stupidity that he fell silent. Mistaking that as a weakness, they gleefully pressed on him.\n\"Heh heh. Did you think we didn’t see you trembling after the spar?\"\n\"And didn't you rush back to the Black Dragon Pavilion to bathe right after training?\"\n\"We know. You pissed yourself and tried to hide it by washing up.\" Follow current novels on n͟o͟v͟e͟l͟f͟i͟r͟e͟.net\nHow stupid humans have to be to misunderstand the situation in such a way?\nWhile Il-mok was laughing in disbelief, they continued to babble.\n\"So stop looking down on us.\"\n\"We just wanted to get closer as fellow disciples, but if you keep this up, we won’t stay quiet.\"\n\"Hahaha. Wouldn’t it be hilarious if rumors spread that the Heavenly Demon’s disciple is a piss-pants?\"\nTheir threat to spread false rumors if he continued to ignore them made him sigh.\nIt didn’t intimidate him. It just reminded him of his time as a civil servant.\n'Trying to explain would be pointless.'\nTrying to reason with retarded people was always futile.\nFor these kinds of people, the only thing that their brains are receptive to is handcuffs, at least that’s how it works in the modern era.\nBut this place was different.\nTap.\nSince he had already lost his appetite due to their stench, Il-mok stood with a smile.\n\"Follow me. Let's have the kind of conversation you're looking for.\"\nUpon reaching a secluded spot behind the dining hall, Il-mok spoke with a disinterested expression, beckoning with his finger.\n\"Come at me.\"\nHis blunt words made the trio’s faces twist.\n\"How arrogant.\"\n\"Even though you passed the entrance exam with flying colors, we're still in the same class as you.\"\n\"Do you think you can handle all three of us by yourself?\"\nTheir confidence came from Il-mok’s earlier spars—he was strong, but not overwhelmingly so.\nOf course, from Il-mok's perspective, it was utterly ridiculous.\n\"Your tongues are quite loose. Am I that frightening to you?\"\n\"Hmph. It’s not you we’re afraid of.\"\n\"Did you forget Instructor Chu Il-hwan’s warning? Unauthorized sparring means penalty points.\"\nAt their words, a deep sneer appeared on Il-mok's lips.\n\"And you, martial artists of the cult, are trembling over a mere penalty point?\"\n\"!!\"\nAs their expressions soured at Il-mok's provocation—\n\"If you're so scared, I'll go first.\"\nIl-mok suddenly launched himself at them.\nHe crossed the distance in an instant and drew the sword on his side without unsheathing it from the scabbard. While swinging it like a club, he said.\n\"Don't worry. I won't kill you!\"\nWhy do instructors and assistant instructors prohibit unauthorized sparring? It's to prevent accidents such as accidentally crippling or killing your opponent by mistake.\nBut Il-mok was confident.\nConfident that he could subdue those guys without resorting to lethal force or crippling them.\nWhack!\nIl-mok's scabbard, moving much faster than during his duel with the assistant instructor, struck the face of the one who stood at the front.\nCaught off guard by Il-mok's surprise attack, the remaining two belatedly drew their weapons to resist, but—\nWhack!\nWhack!\nThey too didn't last long before being struck by Il-mok's scabbard and sent sprawling to the ground by the blows.\nHowever, Il-mok wasn't finished.\n\"You shouldn't run your mouths so carelessly.\"\nWhack!\nWhack!\nLike beating unobedient stray dogs, Il-mok began to thrash the three who were sprawled on the ground.\n‘As long as I don’t kill or cripple them, it’s fine, right?’\nIl-mok knew all too well how to inflict pain without causing permanent damage. He had to thank that to his Master.\nThe Heavenly Demon, who had noticed Il-mok's unique physique—specifically, his talent for rapidly growing stronger when his life was in danger—would often force him to engage in near-death spars.\nHowever, that only worked a few times, as Il-mok eventually adapted to the Heavenly Demon’s killing intent and the immense pressure from his Demonic Energy.\nFrom then on, the Heavenly Demon resorted to striking Il-mok in extremely painful areas without causing lasting harm or killing him.\nIn other words, Il-mok was brilliantly recreating the technique he had learned while being beaten by his master.\n\"Consider it an honor!\"\nAfter all, they are experiencing the technique of the Heavenly Demon, whom they worship like a god!\nAfter thoroughly thrashing the trio with his scabbard for a while—\n\"Phew. That feels refreshing.\"\nAs the pent-up frustration from his obsessive-compulsive disorder and various other issues washed away, Il-mok felt refreshed and naturally wiped his forehead with the back of his hand.\nThen, noticing the sweat on his hand, his face contorted in disgust once more.\n\"Tsk. I've sweated again from all this beating.\"\nIrritated, Il-mok gave the three a few more whacks with the scabbard before abruptly tossing it aside.\n\"Bring me a new scabbard.\"\n\"!?\"\nThe three, who were covered in bruises from the thorough beating, looked up at Il-mok with baffled expressions.\n\"I have issues with cleanliness, so I can't stand touching or getting dirty things on me. I took a bath before eating earlier because I was sweaty, not because I pissed myself. Understand?\"\nAt Il-mok's belated explanation, the three nodded frantically.\nPleased with their now-responsive behavior, Il-mok nodded with satisfaction.\nSure enough, when dealing with difficult people, the fist proved to be more effective than wasting arguments on them.\n\"This scabbard is dirty now from hitting you sweaty bastards, so bring me a new one. I'll be eating, have it back before I finish.\"\n\"Yes, understood!\"\nSatisfied with their now-prompt response, Il-mok smiled contentedly and added.\n\"Oh, and by the way, what happened today is our little secret.\"\nEven in this situation, Il-mok had no intention of abandoning his strategy of concealing his strength.\nAs Il-mok grinned and made a gesture of putting his finger to his lips, the three swallowed hard and nodded frantically.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 62",
    "content": "Chapter 62: Envy (1)\nDuring the afternoon training session...\nInstructor Eun Ryeo, who was in charge of non-combat education, frowned and asked the three people huddled in the corner.\n\"Why do you all look like that?\"\nThe three, who had been thoroughly beaten by Il-mok earlier, instinctively glanced toward him.\nGlare.\nUnder Il-mok’s murderous gaze, they quickly averted their eyes and stammered out an excuse.\n\"We, we had a mi-minor disagreement among ourselves.\"\n\"Hmm? Did you not hear from Instructor Chu that dueling between martial students is prohibited?\"\n\"I-It wasn’t a duel! Just a… small scuffle!\"\n\"Yes, yes. We di-didn't use weapons. It was just a fistfight, Instructor.\"\nAt their desperate excuses, the instructor clicked her tongue.\n\"Tsk. I'll let it slide since it's your first day. But if this happens again, I won't overlook it.\"\n\"W-We’ll remember!\"\nThere was a brief commotion because of the three idiots, but Instructor Eun Ryeo quickly restored order and calmly continued the education.\nThe non-combat education Instructor Eun Ryeo was in charge of was somewhat unusual.\nIt wasn't non-combat education because it taught how to avoid combat. Rather, it taught the necessary skills around combat that didn’t involve direct fighting.\n\"As members of our cult, you will face various missions after graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way. Many of these missions cannot be solved by martial arts alone.\"\nCamping in the wild, stealth, disguise, and tracking techniques—these are all essential skills that need to be learned in the field.\n\"Today, I will teach you about stealth techniques, which are the most fundamental among these skills.\"\nInstructor Eun Ryeo, who had a face like a strict female teacher, continued her explanations and demonstrations wearing a black stealth suit that fit her body perfectly.\nAlthough she appeared to be in her mid-to-late thirties, she was a martial artist of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. Her lean, muscular physique, subtly revealed by her tight-fitting attire, exuded health and fitness.\nAnd Il-mok, who had been attending education with a halfhearted attitude all morning, was now watching Instructor Eun Ryeo's every move with sparkling eyes.\nNot because of her outfit—though that might have been a reasonable assumption. No, this lesson was far more important to him.\n'Stealth techniques! If I master these properly, I can slack off more comfortably!'\nThe ever-lazy Il-mok was fully invested.\nAfter the enjoyable third session, the fourth and final lesson of the day arrived: doctrinal studies.\nIt was natural, if you thought about it.\nThis was the Hall of the Demonic Way, responsible for cultivating talent within the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nReligious schools often had mandatory chapel services, and the Hall of the Demonic Way was no exception.\nIn fact, Il-mok considered this to be relatively lenient.\nFor a cult, dedicating only two out of eight daily hours to doctrinal study was downright generous.\n‘A true cult would’ve filled at least half the day with sermons and worship. Yep.’\nFor that reason, Il-mok had given this fourth class another name.\nBrainwashing Hour.\nBut contrary to his expectations, the doctrine class turned out to be surprisingly enjoyable.\nFor one, it was the only session where he could just sit and listen without moving a muscle.\nThere was a risk of being brainwashed, but he had prepared for that too.\n‘A year under Jin Hayeon’s fanaticism has toughened me up.’\nLike performing the rumored Mudang Sect's Dual Mind Technique.\nIl-mok had reached a point where he could study the cult’s teachings as mere theory while simultaneously cursing them in his mind.\n'Hmm? Come to think of it, if Dual Mind Technique really exists, wouldn’t it be perfect for learning Demonic Arts?’\nWhat if he split his mind in two—one remaining sane, the other fully immersed in demonic corruption?\n‘…Wait, isn’t that just split personality? Was the Dual Mind Technique actually a Demonic Art all along?'\nAs Il-mok entertained these ridiculous thoughts, the two-hour class passed quickly.\nEven after all eight hours of education had ended, the sun had not yet set.\nFormal instruction at the Hall of the Demonic Way was limited to eight hours per day. The remaining time, excluding dinner, was free time.\nBut given that these were the cult’s most promising talents, almost no one wasted their free time idling.\nExcept for just one person.\n\"Hwaaaahm.\"\nIlmok, who had sweated during the third period practicing stealth techniques, emerged from the bathhouse after his customary post-training bath.\nBut he wasn’t planning to sleep just yet.\n\"I should eat first.\"\nAs he leisurely walked toward the dining hall like an idle rich young master, he could see people dedicated to training in various parts of the training grounds.\nSome were practicing martial arts, while others were doing physical exercise or practicing stealth techniques.\n'Everyone's working hard.'\nHe observed as if it were none of his concern. He soon arrived at the empty dining hall.\nJust as he was about to bite his meal, two people approached his table.\n'Sigh. Again?'\nRecalling the lunchtime incident, Il-mok sighed inwardly; thankfully, he didn’t feel the urge to vomit this time.\nIt wasn't because the approaching figures were women.\nIt was because they, like Il-mok, had bathed after training and were free of the stench of sweat.\n\"Mind if we join you?\"\nThe faint scent of cedar lingered around the two women. Il-mok answered indifferently.\n\"I don't mind, but aren't there plenty of empty seats?\"\nIt was an answer that could have offended them, but the two women merely smiled faintly.\n\"We thought it would be a good opportunity to speak with you, since we're now fellow disciples at the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\nThis was natural, if you thought about it.\nIl-mok was the youngest disciple of the Heavenly Demon—a man worshipped as a god—and a genius who had topped the Hall’s entrance exam after just one year of joining the cult.\nOn top of that, he’d caused quite a stir during that year.\nThe rumors were so abundant that most people were curious to speak with him at least once.\nExcept for Dokgo Pae, who harbored a needless competitive spirit against Ilmok.\nEven the three from lunch had initially wanted to befriend him—they’d only picked a fight after his disgusted expression wounded their pride.\nIl-mok, too, relaxed when he realized these women had no intention of challenging him to a duel.\n\"If that’s the case, feel free to sit.\"\nAs soon as Il-mok gave permission, the two women sat across from him and introduced themselves.\n\"I'm Bang Mi-hwa.\"\n\"I'm Ha Yeong.\"\n\"I'm Il-mok.\"\n\"We've heard a lot about you.\"\n\"About me?\"\nAnd so, Il-mok began his first normal conversation since entering the Hall.\nAnd not long after, Il-mok belatedly realized a very important and unexpected problem.\nThe conversation started normally.\n\"Of course. Word spread quickly that the Heavenly Demon had taken on an exceptional new disciple.\"\n\"Hahaha. You're making me blush with all your praise.\"\nThey exchanged light compliments based on rumors, and Il-mok played along, maintaining a pleasant atmosphere.\nThe problem came after that.\n\"Actually, Mi-hwa's father is the chief of the Red Turtle Corps.\"\n\"Hohoho. Ah Young's father is also the chief of the White Dragon Corps.\"\n\"The two of them were actually classmates at the Hall, because of that connection, we've been playing together since childhood.\"\n\"Commanders of the cult's military corps... They must be remarkable individuals.\"\nIl-mok also responded with appropriately sociable praise, but he had nothing more to say.\nHe had spent the entire year cooped up in Windrock Palace, solely preparing for the Hall entrance exam.\nWhile he had learned about various organizations and groups within the Demonic Cult during his studies, he knew little about their leaders. He never had any reason to interact with them in the first place.\nIt’s obvious why the conversation stalled. To break the awkward silence, the women introduced a new topic.\n\"By the way, which passage from the doctrine do you like the most, Young Master?\"\nThe topic of doctrine.\nWhen strangers meet, the easiest way to become close is to find common ground.\nThat's why people who believe in the same religion can easily connect without needing to pry into each other's hobbies or preferences.\nDiscussing religious doctrines or scriptures naturally led to engaging conversations.\nThe problem was...\n'What is this? A loyalty test?'\nIl-mok wasn't a fanatic.\nStill, he could manage.\nAs he had done during the previous doctrinal study, he was now accustomed to outwardly praising the doctrine while inwardly cursing it.\nThe real problem came later.\n\"Hahaha.\"\n\"Hohoho.\"\nBang Mi-hwa’s bright smile that bloomed on her face truly lived up to her name, a blooming flower.\nIl-mok stared at her face, his gaze fixated, and messy thoughts emerged...\n'...I want to touch it.'\nHe hadn't noticed it before.\n‘…She’d hate it, wouldn’t she?’\nIt was only after seeing her laugh that he realized.\n'...Please!'\nThat she had a serious facial asymmetry.\nIt didn't mean she was ugly. No, if anything, her face would be considered among the beautiful.\nIn the modern world, there were even celebrities who, despite being beautiful, were self-conscious about their asymmetrical features and would only take photos from certain angles.\nIt wasn't very noticeable before, but the moment she smiled brightly, the facial asymmetry became visibly apparent.\nAnd unfortunately, Il-mok's obsessive-compulsive disorder latched onto that asymmetry.\n‘If I forced her bones into alignment, she’d despise me, right?’\nThe urge to break and reset her facial structure for perfect symmetry surged uncontrollably.\nBang Mi-hwa's very existence had unwittingly become a trigger for his Qi Deviation.\nJust as Il-mok was teetering on the edge—\n\"Young Master Ilmok!!\"\nSnap!\nSnapping out of his obsessive thoughts, Il-mok turned towards the voice.\n\"There you are! I've been looking for you everywhere!\"\nIt was Jin Hayeon’s sasaeng fan who approached him with the same manic smile yesterday.\nNormally, he wouldn't associate with such a crazy person, but the situation was different now.\n\"W-welcome!\"\nIlmok quickly stood up and welcomed her.\n\"Th-this is Miss Bang Mi-hwa. And Miss Ha Young.\"\nIl-mok introduced Bang Mi-hwa and Ha Young to her, but he couldn't properly look at Bang Mi-hwa.\nIf he stared at that face, his OCD would likely surge again.\n\"And this is... sorry, what was your name again?\"\nWhen he asked this of his savior, whose name he didn't even know, she replied vigorously as if not minding.\n\"My name is Ju Seo-yeon (朱瑞燕), YoungMaster!\"\n\"I-I see. Anyway, this is Miss Ju Seo-yeon. Since we've joined at the table by fate, why don't you all have a chat?\"\nIl-mok began rambling due to the crisis of obsession.\nBang Mi-hwa had approached Il-mok out of simple curiosity.\nIn the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, reverence was reserved solely for the Heavenly Demon, while his disciples were merely objects of respect.\nThis stemmed from the cult's doctrine of worshipping strength.\nWhen the current Heavenly Demon ascended to the heavens, only the strongest individuals could inherit his position. Even then, only those who had perfected the Heavenly Demon Divine Technique could be worthy to be called the Heavenly Demon.\nSimply being the Heavenly Demon’s disciple did not guarantee becoming the next Heavenly Demon, so there was no particular need for veneration.\nIn any case, Bang Mi-hwa, who had approached Il-mok out of curiosity, felt a strange sensation in the middle of their friendly conversation.\nAt one point, Il-mok had stared intently at her smiling face, unable to look away.\nHis gaze was so blatant that Bang Mi-hwa thought....\n'Heh heh. It seems even the renowned youngest disciple has fallen for my beauty.'\nIt wasn't a bad feeling.\nIf it were someone else, she might not care, but wasn't he the youngest master who had been the talk of the cult recently? He wouldn't be a bad match for her.\nHowever, she couldn't appear too eager.\nWhile she was pondering how to handle this man, an interloper appeared.\n\"Young Master Ilmok! There you are! I've been looking for you everywhere!!\"\nA woman, not as beautiful as herself but still passable, had boldly interrupted their conversation. Follow current novels on novel{f}ire.net\nAnd after her arrival, Young Master Il-mok had shifted his attention solely to her.\nBut Bang Mi-hwa wasn't angry.\nGlance.\nThroughout their conversation, Young Master Il-mok had repeatedly tried to look at her before quickly averting his gaze.\nSeeing this, she grew confident.\n'Heheh. Unlike his appearance, the Young Master is quite shy.'\nHe was clearly smitten but too embarrassed to admit it.\n'Then perhaps I should be a bit more aggressive,' Bang Mi-hwa thought.\nBang Mi-hwa.\nThe side effect of her Demonic Art was narcissistic personality disorder.",

    "content": "Chapter 63: Envy (2)\nThat night.\nUpon returning to his room, Il-mok immediately sat cross-legged and sank into meditation.\nIt wasn't that enlightenment had come to him.\n‘Namu Amitabha. Buddha, divine spirits, banish these demonic thoughts!'\nHe was drawing upon every deity and religion that came to mind to fight against his Heart Demon.\nThe trigger was Bang Mi-hwa, a walking catalyst for his Qi Deviation.\nIl-mok was a human with common sense, after all.\nOne simply couldn't tell a woman upon first meeting that her face looked like it needed plastic surgery.\nThe problem was that the longer he spent around her, the worse his obsessive compulsions became.\n'I need to avoid her. I must avoid her.'\nHe felt that if he kept running into her, he’d end up performing the 'Moonlight Sculpting Art' on her jawbone and cheekbones.\nFrom that day onward, life in the Hall of the Demonic Way flowed like a spinning wheel.\nEight hours of training a day, followed by free time.\nWith Jin Ha-yeon and the Heavenly Demon gone, Il-mok could finally indulge in laziness to his heart's content.\nAt least, that’s how it was in theory.\nThe problem lay in the people around him.\nWhile they weren't as demanding as Jin Hayeon or his Master, they were a nuisance in their own way.\n\"Today will be different!\"\nDokgo Pae, seemingly tireless, challenged him to a spar yet again.\n\"Hahahahaha.\"\nInstructor Chu Il-hwan's constant, unnerving laughter and unsettling gaze sent shivers down Il-mok's spine.\n\"Young Master! About Miss Jin Hayeon...\"\nJu Seoyeon, Jin Hayeon's follower, came looking for him every afternoon. She wasn’t even in the same classroom with him, yet she always sought him whenever there was free time.\nBut the most terrifying of them all was, of course, Bang Mi-hwa.\nAs luck would have it, she was in the Upper Class like Dokgo Pae.\nAnd for some reason, whenever Il-mok happened to turn his gaze toward her, she was always looking at him.\nEvery time their eyes met, she’d flash a radiant smile, proudly displaying her facial asymmetry.\n'Please. God.' Content orıginally comes from novel⦿fire.net\nWhenever that happens, he would always quickly turn his head away, lest his Heart Demon go berserk—only to hear her giggle as if she found him cute.\nEach time, the urge to switch careers and become her personal plastic surgeon grew stronger.\nWith traps lurking everywhere he looked, Il-mok had no choice but to fix his gaze on one spot.\nFortunately, during training hours, there was a designated place to fix his gaze, the instructor.\nEver since realizing the dangers of looking around, Il-mok kept his eyes locked on the instructor for the entire session.\nA chance encounter with Dokgo Pae or Bang Mi-hwa could lead to unwanted complications.\nThanks to this, his reputation among the instructors had improved significantly.\n\"What do you think of the Eighth Young Master?\"\n\"He's certainly extraordinary.\"\n\"Indeed. Talent aside, his enthusiasm is remarkable.\"\n\"He was like that during Instructor Eun’s session too.\"\n\"Did you feel it too, Instructor Cheok?\"\n\"Yes. His gaze was so intense, I was afraid I’d make a mistake in my demonstration. Haha.\"\n\"Hmm. He certainly seemed indifferent on the first day, but I don't understand why he suddenly changed.\"\n\"Mmm. Maybe he was disappointed in his peers’ skill level at first?\"\n\"Well, given his talent, that’s understandable.\"\nListening to his fellow instructors discussing Il-mok, Chu Il-hwan tilted his head in confusion.\n'How strange. I distinctly felt like he was avoiding my gaze during my classes.'\nThe only time Il-mok did not look at the instructor was during Chu Il-hwan's classes.\nTen days into his stay at the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nAfter finishing his daily routine.\n\"Young Master!\"\nHearing the voices of Bang Mihwa, Ha Yeong, and Ju Seoyeon coming from both sides, Il-mok instinctively thought, 'Run.'\nTraining sessions were bearable. All he had to do was keep his eyes on the instructor. Chu Il-hwan’s classes were a bit of a problem, but he had his ways of coping.\nHowever, there was no escape during free time.\nHe wanted to shut himself in his room and rest, but if he did, those three—plus Dokgo Pae—would barge in nonstop, leaving him no peace.\nPretending not to hear them, Il-mok turned his back and hurried off somewhere.\nPat!\nUtilizing his lightness skill, he darted through the massive Hall of the Demonic Way, searching for a hiding spot.\n'Oh.'\nFinding a secluded area between buildings, he leaped into the shadows.\nUnfortunately, there was already someone there.\n'Hm? I thought no one was here?'\nIt was a strange feeling. He hadn't sensed anyone's presence, yet upon arriving, he found someone standing there.\n'I think I've seen them a few times? Or maybe not?'\nEven among the small group of twenty disciples, Il-mok struggled to recognize this one. Partly because he had no interest in knowing potential mental patients, but mostly because this disciple’s presence was faint.\nHis gloomy, hunched posture should have been noticeable, yet somehow his presence was remarkably subtle.\nThe presence-less disciple, holding a drawn bow aimed at something, turned at the sound of movement, then shrieked.\n\"Hiiik!\"\nSeeing him tremble as if he'd seen a ghost, Il-mok made an awkward expression.\n\"Ahem. I apologize for disturbing your training.\"\n\"N-n-no, Y-Young M-Master.\"\nThe disciple stuttered a reply to Il-mok's apology, trembling as they replied.\nIl-mok was baffled. Even though he was the Heavenly Demon’s disciple, it was rare for someone to tremble so much in his presence.\nAfter a brief contemplation, Il-mok approached the disciple.\nNo matter how he looked at it, this was the most secluded place in the Hall. Though he felt a little bad for the disciple who had been training here, Il-mok decided to hide here.\n\"This is the first time we've spoken directly. I'm Il-mok.\"\n\"I-I-I am J-Jeong Hyeon, Y-Young M-Master.\"\nFor a second, Il-mok wondered if stuttering was a side effect of Jeong Hyeon’s Demonic Art, but asking would be rude.\n\"We’re fellow disciples here. No need for formalities.\"\n\"I-I'm m-more comfortable w-with this...\"\nJeong Hyeon replied, avoiding eye contact with Il-mok and looking around anxiously.\nFeeling somewhat awkward, Il-mok noticed the bow Jeong Hyeon was holding.\n\"Oh. It seems Disciple Jeong learned archery.\"\n\"Y-yes.\"\n\"I truly envy you.\"\n\"!?\"\nJeong Hyeon, who had been avoiding Il-mok's gaze, looked at him with a startled expression.\n\"E-envy? It’s j-just a cowardly skill, unbefitting a disciple of the Divine Cult!\"\nJeong Hyeon spat out the words as if expelling them, then belatedly avoided Il-mok's gaze again.\nThen, Jeong Hyeon quickly averted their eyes again, afraid Il-mok might take offense.\nBut Il-mok harbored no such thoughts.\nBecause he genuinely envied Jeong Hyeon.\n'Damn! Why wasn’t archery an option when I picked my Demonic Art?!'\nSurvival was Il-mok's top priority. In that sense, what martial art could be more excellent than archery?\nThere was no need to charge in with a sword; one could simply hide behind cover and shoot arrows from a distance.\nFor the first time in a while, he resented his Master for not teaching him archery.\n'I envy him. Can I switch now? …Shit. Would that mean double the side effects?'\nPushing away these idle thoughts, Il-mok spoke sincerely.\n\"Why do the cult’s warriors learn Demonic Arts? Isn't it to punish evil and protect the weak? There’s no such thing as ‘noble’ or ‘cowardly’ when killing villains. Being able to shoot and kill villains from a distance makes archery a truly excellent martial art.\"\n\"!!!\"\nJeong Hyeon, who had been avoiding his gaze, looked at Il-mok with a moved expression before quickly turning away again.\nRight at that moment.\n\"Young Master!!\"\nThe voice of the walking catastrophe echoed from beyond the buildings.\nIl-mok quickly moved to cling to Jeong Hyeon and whispered.\n\"I’m going to practice stealth now. If anyone asks where I am, pretend you didn’t see me.\"\n\".......\"\nJeong Hyeon froze completely as Il-mok suddenly got way too close.\nTaking Jeong Hyeon's silence as agreement, Il-mok promptly leaped into the shadows and deployed his concealment technique.\nIt was the concealment technique he had learned from Instructor Eun Ryeo over the past ten days. Though he had only been learning it for ten days, thanks to his black clothes and the shadows, he could manage to hide his body fairly well.\nNo sooner had Il-mok concealed himself than footsteps drew near, and finally Bang Mihwa and Ha Yeong arrived.\nBang Mi-hwa quickly scanned the surroundings, then approached the dazed Jeong Hyeon who stood holding his bow.\n\"Have you seen the Eighth Young Master?\"\n\"T-that...\"\nIn response to her question, Jeong Hyeon stammered, unable to make eye contact.\n\"Did you see him? Or not?\"\n\"W-well, t-that...\"\n\"Could you please look me in the eye when speaking?\"\nAs Bang Mi-hwa and Ha Yeong drew closer and pressed him, Jeong Hyeon began to tremble anxiously, as if about to have a seizure.\nAlarmed by his sudden distress, they rushed to his side.\n\"A-are you alright?\"\n\"Breathe! Take deep breaths!\"\nBut their sudden proximity only made Jeong Hyeon’s condition worse.\nWhile the two were at a loss for what to do, Il-mok, who had already dispelled his concealment technique, quickly approached Jeong Hyeon.\nHe couldn’t just hide after causing this mess.\n\"Young Master?\"\nConfused by his sudden appearance, the two women watched as Il-mok scooped Jeong Hyeon up and dashed away while using his lightness skill.\nIl-mok, Bang Mi-hwa, and Ha Young stared down at Jeong Hyeon, who lay on a bed like a corpse.\nNot dead, actually. Just got knocked out by sealing his pressure points.\nSoon after, Instructor Eun Ryeo opened the door and entered the room.\nBy sheer luck, they had encountered her shortly after Il-mok had carried Jeong Hyeon away.\nThe instructor had sealed Jeong Hyeon's pressure points to stop his seizure and moved him here.\nShe had just returned from checking the official register listing the disciples' special conditions to determine the cause of the seizure.\n\"Do you know what happened?\" asked Il-mok.\nThe stern-faced Instructor Eun Ryeo responded with a question of her own.\n\"Do you know anything about the Demonic Art Disciple Jeong Hyeon has learned?\"\n\"I haven't heard anything about it.\"\nIl-mok replied, speaking on behalf of the group. Bang Mi-hwa and Ha-yeong shook their heads in agreement.\nInstructor Eun-ryeo sighed lightly.\n\"The Demonic Art that Disciple Jeong has learned is the Ghost Spirit Divine Bow (鬼靈神弓). It specializes in long-range assassination. As befitting such a skill, it has a hidden effect that makes the practitioner's body and mind extremely sensitive to anyone approaching them.\"\nInstructor Eun Ryeo’s explanation finally allowed Il-mok to grasp the situation.\n'So the side effect is anthropophobia?'\nNow Jeong Hyeon's dejected behavior began to make sense.\nThe way he constantly avoided eye contact, and how he would flinch at the slightest approach.\nThough unintentional, Il-mok had caused Jeong Hyeon’s breakdown.\nHe expressed remorse.\n\"I'll be more careful in the future.\"\n\"That's good. Disciple Jeong must also overcome his side effects, as avoiding people completely isn’t the right solution. Approach him cautiously from now on.\"\nInstructor Eun Ryeo spoke as if explaining how to deal with a skittish pet.\n“He needs rest, so you three should all return now.”\nThe three left the room as instructed.\n\"I never thought he would have a breakdown because of us.\"\nHa Yeong muttered with a deeply shaken face, and Bang Mi-hwa also nodded and said, \"My beauty must have startled Disciple Jeong.\"\nIl-mok nearly laughed out loud at her baseless confidence.\n'They don't seem like bad people, so I’ll let it go for now.'\nThey had genuinely tried to help Jeong-hyeon when he collapsed.\nBut Bang Mi-hwa seemed unwilling to let this opportunity pass.\n\"Still, thanks to Young Master Il-mok, Disciple Jeong was able to receive treatment quickly.\"\nSeizing the moment, she suddenly began chattering away to Il-mok, and Ha Yeong joined in to support her.\n\"But where were you, Young Master Il-mok?\"\n\"You appeared so suddenly, it startled us.\"\nThanks to the two women talking incessantly, Il-mok felt that he might soon have a breakdown himself and end up lying next to Jeong Hyeon.\n\"Ahem. I was honing my stealth technique.\"\nIl-mok responded casually as he walked straight ahead, trying to avoid looking at Bang Mi-hwa.\nMisreading his attitude as shyness, Bang Mi-hwa stepped in front and turned to face him directly.\n\"!!!\"\nHer asymmetrical smile filled his vision. His brain, fighting for his sanity, scrambled for a solution.\nAt this rate, he really might pull a knife to carve her face.\nIn this crisis, his brain found a brilliant workaround.\n“Could you walk beside me, Miss Bang?\"\n\"Your side?\"\nIf facial asymmetry was the issue, then he only needed to see one side of her face.\nBut he couldn't just force her to stand sideways without reason. Il-mok was able to recall an excellent excuse from his modern memories.\n\"Yes. I think Miss Bang looks more beautiful when you walk by my side.\"\nThe so-called \"best angle\"—a trend that had been popular when Il-mok was a student.\n(TL Note: If there are inconsistencies in Jeong Hyeon’s pronounce in further chapters, don’t worry, they are intentional)",

    "content": "Chapter 64: Envy (3)\nThe following afternoon.\nIl-mok was enjoying a meal with Bang Mi-hwa and Ha Young.\nSurprisingly, he managed to finish the meal without much discomfort. He wiped his mouth and spoke.\n\"I'll take my leave first to continue my training.\"\nHa Young, seated across from him, and Bang Mi-hwa, beside him, responded with gentle smiles.\n\"We have evening training as well, so please go ahead, Young Master.\"\n\"Today was a pleasant time as well.\"\nHowever, for some reason, Bang Mi-hwa was looking straight ahead rather than at Il-mok directly while answering.\nThe reason was simple, she was maintaining the angle he had mentioned yesterday.\nBecause of yesterday's incident, Bang Mi-hwa had become convinced.\nThat Il-mok was infatuated with her.\nAnd just in case, she had checked herself in a mirror upon returning to her quarters. She had to admit that her right side was indeed more attractive than her left.\nThus, Bang Mi-hwa had spent the entire day positioning herself on Il-mok’s left, even during classes.\nIt was a thoughtful gesture, ensuring that whenever he turned his head, he would always see her right side.\nShe was the kind of woman who could extend such consideration to a man she fancied, especially one who admired her.\n'Hehe. What a woman I am.'\nShe was quite taken with her own magnanimity.\nAnd it seemed her efforts had paid off. The Eighth Young Master no longer avoided her today and even initiated conversation from time to time.\nIn a way, it was contradictory.\nUntil yesterday, she had assumed he was avoiding her out of shyness.\nYet, today, even though she had only shown him her beautiful right side, he spoke to her without hesitation.\nBut Bang Mi-hwa didn’t dwell on the contradiction.\n'He must have realized that if he kept being shy, he’d lose a beauty like me. Hohoho.'\nFor someone with narcissistic personality disorder, the world always revolves around themselves.\nAfter parting ways with Bang Mi-hwa and Ha Young, Il-mok headed to the same secluded spot as yesterday.\nThough he had found a way to solve his problem with Bang Mi-hwa, Il-mok still preferred secluded places.\nA spot where he could rest without prying eyes.\nWhen he arrived, he found Jeong Hyeon there again, practicing archery.\n'It must be because of his social anxiety.'\nNo doubt, this place was comfortable for him too.\n\"Ahem.\"\nIl-mok deliberately cleared his throat to make his presence known while keeping a considerate distance.\nJeong Hyeon, who had been focused on his target, flinched at the sound and turned.\nHe flinched slightly upon seeing Il-mok before scrambling to greet him. Il-mok quickly raised his hands in a placating gesture and bowed.\n\"I apologize for yesterday.\"\nJeong Hyeon’s expression twisted in a mixture of emotions before he carefully opened his mouth.\n\"I-I was the one who acted pathetically. I should be the one apologizing, Young Master.\"\n\"It wasn’t your fault. There’s no need for apologies.\"\n\"Y-you didn't have any ill intentions either, Young Master. There's no need for you to apologize.\"\nSatisfied that his apology had been accepted, Il-mok cautiously asked.\n\"Would it be alright if I came here from now on? This seems like the best place to practice stealth.\"\nJeong Hyeon hesitated at the question.\nThis place wasn't his home to begin with, so Jeong Hyeon had no right to tell Il-mok whether to come or not.\nHe could choose to avoid this place himself, but Jeong Hyeon also found this nearly deserted location most comfortable.\nThat left one option: sharing the space.\nAfter contemplating this briefly, Jeong Hyeon nodded and replied.\n\"Y-You’re welcome to come, Young Master. I look forward to… training with you.”\nIt was thanks to Il-mok’s words yesterday.\nThe memory of Il-mok acknowledging his archery—which was often dismissed as a coward’s skill—made Jeong Hyeon feel somewhat more comfortable around him.\nNoticing that the other party seemed a bit more at ease, Il-mok smiled softly and said.\n\"Since we’ll be sharing this space, feel free to address me casually, Disciple Jeong.\"\n\"I-I'm still more c-comfortable this way. S-sorry.\"\nWatching him bow deeply, Il-mok scratched his head awkwardly and changed the subject.\n\"Ah, now that I think about it, your martial art is quite unique. Are you skilled in stealth techniques as well?\"\n\"It's not something I can boast about, but I have learned some.\"\nAs he spoke, Jeong Hyeon slung his bow over his back, and his presence gradually blurred.\nJeong Hyeon's already faint presence became even hazier until he was no longer visible to Il-mok's eyes.\nAnd a moment later.\nJeong Hyeon, with a much more relaxed expression than when conversing with Il-mok, carefully released his stealth technique and reappeared.\nWatching a person fade in and out right before his eyes, Il-mok couldn’t help but exclaim in admiration.\n\"That’s incredible! Disciple Jeong, could you teach me a little?\"\n\"M-me?!\"\nAt Jeong Hyeon's startled question, Il-mok nodded vigorously.\n\"From what I’ve seen, your stealth is the best among the disciples! If you’re willing, could you share some of that skill with me?\"\n\"C-Calling something like stealth a ‘great technique’ is… t-too much.\"\n\"Nonsense! What skill could be more valuable than stealth?\"\nWith stealth, he could hide and laze around anywhere, anytime!\n'Dammit! I should’ve learned this from Third Brother earlier!'\nRegret gnawed at him for not learning the stealth technique before the Hall’s entrance exam.\nWhile Il-mok was lost in thought, Jeong Hyeon’s face flushed red at the praise.\nFirst for his archery, now for his stealth.\n\"W-Well, if you insist… I-I’ll do my best to teach you.\"\nHe demonstrated his stealth techniques several times, diligently explaining the insights and experience he had learned.\nAfter listening attentively to Jeong Hyeon's lesson, Il-mok spoke with a somewhat disgruntled tone.\n\"Um... couldn't you teach me from a bit closer?\"\nJeong Hyeon had been maintaining a distance of at least three meters while demonstrating his technique.\nEvery time Il-mok took a step forward to see better—\nFlinch\n—Jeong Hyeon would take one step back.\nHe wasn’t ready to abandon social distancing just yet.\nFrom that day on, Il-mok and Jeong Hyeon spent their evenings practicing either stealth or lightness skills.\nToday, after another fruitful session, Il-mok decided to test his progress. Wearing black robes, he activated his stealth and headed toward the Black Dragon Pavilion.\nAlong the way, he spotted a group of fellow disciples chatting.\n'Perfect. Let me test whether they notice me or not.'\nTreading carefully to maintain his stealth, he approached them, but they remained oblivious to his presence.\nAs he drew closer, their conversation became audible.\n\"It’s downright pathetic, don’t you think?\"\n\"That's what I'm saying. How can someone act like that in the Hall of the Demonic Way?\"\nThough he only caught snippets, Il-mok quickly grasped the topic.\n'Gossiping is a universal human trait, I guess.'\nHe was about to ignore it, partly because he had no interest in it and partly because he deemed it not worth his time, when he suddenly froze in his step.\n\"Even if Il-mok is the Heavenly Demon’s youngest disciple, does she really think sucking up to him will secure her a position? How delusional.\"\nTo his disbelief, he was part of the gossip.\nAt least they weren’t directly insulting him. If they had, he’d have taught them a lesson like he did with those three idiots before.\n\"Is it because of her lack of talent that she resorts to such cheap tricks?\"\n\"I heard she barely scraped into the Hall.\"\n\"Lately, she’s been tailing the Young Master so much, so much that she barely trains and is at risk of failing.\"\n\"What kind of martial artist joins the Hall only to neglect her own growth?\"\n\"Hahaha. Maybe she’s smitten with him? Since she's already failed as a warrior, maybe she's aiming to become his concubine instead.\"\nIt wasn’t hard to guess who they were talking about.\n'It's not Bang Mi-hwa nor Ha Young.'\nThose two were in the Upper Class like him and diligent in their training.\nThat left only one person—Ju Seo-yeon.\n'...I never imagined rumors would spread like this.'\nIl-mok nearly laughed out loud.\nJu Seo-yeon, trying to become his concubine? Even a stray dog would find that ridiculous. Her goal wasn't him but Jin Hayeon.\n'What a bunch of idiots.'\nSince it was just a meaningless, baseless rumor anyway, Il-mok decided to ignore it and continued walking toward the Black Dragon Pavilion while thinking about something.\n'Hmm. The gossip isn't my business, but her constant visits are annoying.'\nPondering how to shake her off, a wicked grin spread across his face as a plan formed.\nThe next day.\nInstead of going straight to meet Jeong Hyeon as usual, Il-mok waited for someone near the dining hall.\n\"Young Master!\"\nSoon enough, a certain persistent stalker who had been searching for him all day arrived.\nLooking at Ju Seoyeon approaching with her eyes sparkling as always, Il-mok asked with a stern expression.\n\"Ju Seo-yeon, do you truly admire Jin Hayeon that much?\"\n\"!!! Yes! Finally, you understand my feelings, Young Master! About Miss Jin Hayeon...\"\nJust as she launched into another fanatic spiel, Il-mok struck first.\n\"Stop!\"\nSeizing the initiative, Il-mok pressed her before she could regain her composure.\n\"Then why don't you act like Miss Jin?\"\n\"!?\"\n\"Jin Hayeon started from nothing, entered the Hall with low scores, yet graduated from the Hall as the second-ranked disciple. But what are you doing right now?\"\n\"So you knew too, Young Master! Yes! Miss Jin is truly an exemplary figure who, despite her lofty and beautiful appearance, overcame harsh conditions through effort!\"\nJu Seoyeon was indeed a formidable opponent. Even after being scolded, she hadn't lost her admiration for Jin Hayeon.\nIl-mok felt exasperated, but he couldn't just stand there and let Ju Seoyeon derail the conversation. Thıs content belongs to novelFɪre.net\n\"Disciple Ju. I am the youngest disciple of the Heavenly Demon. Do you think I would take on an incompetent person as my attendant?\"\n\"You’re absolutely right, Young Master! Only someone like Miss Jin is worthy of your attention!\"\n\"What I mean is, at your current level, you’re not fit to be my subordinate. Obviously, you’ll never be Jin Hayeon’s junior either.\"\n\"!!!\"\nOnly then did Ju Seoyeon look at Il-mok with a shocked expression.\nSeizing the opening, Il-mok delivered the final blow.\n\"Miss Jin graduated from the Hall as the second-best. Since the position of the top seat will obviously be mine, you should at least aim for the second rank. If you can’t even fulfill that, you should give up your dream of becoming Ji Hayeon’s junior.”\n\"H-how could that be...\"\nLooking at Ju Seoyeon, whose face suggested she might have a breakdown any moment, Il-mok casually dropped the final bait.\n“On the other hand, if you do graduate as the second in rank, I’ll personally take you as my subordinate.\"\n\"!!!\"\nJu Seoyeon looked at Il-mok with a startled face.\nThe scheme Il-mok had devised was simple.\nOffer an obsessed fan the chance to meet their idol in person if they achieve a certain rank.\nFor a true fan, it was a condition that would make their eyes roll.\n\"So instead of wasting time chasing me to talk about Jin Ha-yeon, devote every second to training.\"\n\"Yes, Young Master!! I will definitely secure second place!\"\nAs Il-mok had expected, Ju Seoyeon left with a face like she had received some divine mission.\nWatching Ju Seoyeon's retreating figure in the distance, Il-mok smirked.\n'I've finally gotten rid of one leech.'\nIl-mok had no intention of taking her as his attendant. She would be a nuisance to Jin Hayeon, and it seemed like it would be troublesome in many ways.\n'Since she barely passed the entrance exam, second place should be impossible, right?'\nThis was just an elaborate trick to keep her away from him.\nHowever, what Il-mok failed to understand and dismissed was one crucial factor.\nIt was the madness of a sasaeng fan.",

    "content": "Chapter 65: Envy (4)\nAround the time Il-mok was talking with Ju Seo-yeon.\nIn the secluded training ground where Il-mok usually visited, Jeong Hyeon kept glancing nervously in a certain direction, his eyes filled with unease.\n\"…Did I do something wrong to the Young Master?\"\nHe looked toward the path where Il-mok usually appeared. For some reason, Il-mok hadn't shown up today.\n\"Well… I can’t blame him.\"\nJeong Hyeon sighed deeply, recalling how he had flinched and backed away whenever Il-mok approached him.\nHis sigh was heavily tinged with self-loathing.\nHaving social anxiety didn't necessarily mean hating people unconditionally. If he had suffered deep trauma and grown to despise humans, that would be one thing, but Jeong Hyeon’s condition was really a side effect of his Demonic Art.\n\"…Am I going to be alone again?\"\nThough he panicked when others approached, being alone was unbearably lonely.\n\"Maybe I should try to find a new friend...\"\nThe thought crossed his mind, but Jeong Hyeon quickly hung his head in resignation.\n\"Who am I kidding...\"\nHow could he possibly make friends when he would have a breakdown just from people coming near him?\nNaturally, his longing for Il-mok grew stronger.\nFor Jeong Hyeon, who had been alone since entering the Hall of the Demonic Way, Il-mok was like a ray of light.\nJust as a tear threatened to roll down his cheek—\n\"What are you doing there?\"\nIl-mok’s voice snapped him out of his thoughts.\nStanding at the edge of the training ground, Il-mok looked at him with a puzzled expression.\n\"Are you also skilled in drawing?\"\nJeong Hyeon was crouched in a corner, sketching something on the ground with a stick.\nComing to his senses belatedly, Jeong-hyun looked down at the drawing he had made on the ground.\nIl-mok's face was drawn there.\nIn his loneliness, he had drawn the person he missed, the first person who had almost become his friend.\nRealizing what he had done, Jeong Hyeon let out a strangled shriek.\n\"Heeek!?\"\nHe realized the drawing could easily be misunderstood.\nNot wanting to creep out his potential friend, Jeong Hyeon frantically slashed at the sketch with his stick.\nIl-mok’s face was mercilessly mutilated beyond recognition.\nWatching Jeong Hyeon deface the drawing of an unidentifiable person's face, Il-mok awkwardly asked.\n\"Ahem. If… if I’m making you uncomfortable, I’ll leave.\" Latest content publıshed on N0veI.Fiɾe.net\nHe wondered if his presence was worsening Jeong Hyeon’s condition.\n\"No, no, Young Master! I'm fine! I mean, I do have issues, but it's okay for you to be here!\"\nRambling incoherently, Jeong-hyun quickly changed the subject.\n\"Y-You’re later than usual today, Young Master.\"\nJeong Hyeon immediately regretted it after realizing what he was saying.\n'Now it sounds like I’m scolding him for being late! It’s not like he promised to come here every day! Stupid, stupid Jeong Hyeon!'\nOblivious to Jeong Hyeon’s thoughts, Il-mok answered nonchalantly.\n\"Ah, I was busy peeling off a leech.\"\n\"A, a leech, you say?\"\nWere there leeches in the Hall of the Demonic Way?\nBefore he could ponder further, Jeong Hyeon shook his head vigorously.\n'Pull yourself together, Jeong Hyeon! You can't miss this opportunity! Right! Instructor Eu Ryeo said it. No matter the side effects, I have to overcome them!'\nGathering his courage, Jeong Hyeon asked.\n\"Are, are you pl-planning to pr-practice st-stealth techniques to-today as well, Young Master?\"\n\"That's the plan.\"\n\"Then I'll d-do my b-best to te-teach you si-sincerely!\"\nHis stuttering was worse than usual, making Il-mok raise an eyebrow.\nJeong Hyeon gathered great courage and took one step closer to Il-mok to demonstrate.\nWatching his unusually determined demeanor, Il-mok thought.\n'Still a long way to go.'\nJust one step.\nNo more, no less, exactly one step.\nThat was the limit of Jeong Hyeon’s bravery.\nWhile Il-mok was practicing stealth techniques with Jeong Hyeon.\nBang Mi-hwa was practicing martial arts in one of the Black Dragon Hall’s training grounds with Ha Young.\nAs a talented student of the Hall of the Demonic Way, she had no intention of neglecting her training. To be precise, she was busy admiring herself for being so dedicated to her training as the future of the cult.\nConfident in herself, she trained separately rather than chasing Il-mok around every day.\nIn the midst of a friendly match with her close friend Ha Young, Bang Mi-hwa had a thought.\n'Ah. If only there were a large mirror in the training ground.'\nShe believed her martial arts performance could be compared to a celestial maiden’s dance. It was a shame she couldn’t see it herself.\nWhile Bang Mi-hwa was thoroughly self-absorbed,\n\"Mi-hwa.\"\nHa Young, who was crossing her iron fan with Mi-hwa's soft sword, called out to her.\nFinally coming to her senses, Bang Mi-hwa looked at Ha Young with a puzzled expression. Ha Young subtly tilted her head toward a group of fellow disciples walking by.\nThere, several classmates from the hall were walking by, engaged in conversation.\nBut neither Bang Mi-hwa nor Ha Young was particularly interested in them. They were students from the Lower Class.\nThe issue was the content of their conversation.\nThey were discussing the same rumors Il-mok had heard, about Ju Seo-yeon seducing him to secure a position as his concubine.\n“Now that I think about it, it’s strange, wasn’t it? Disciple Ju was always tailing the Eighth Young Master wherever he went,” said Ha Young with a concerned tone, knowing that her friend Bang Mi-hwa had peculiar feelings toward Il-mok, \"Right, Mi-hwa... huh?\"\nAnd when she turned her head, she saw Bang Mi-hwa running off somewhere.\nMeanwhile, at that time.\nJu Seo-yeon was in another training ground, swinging her spear like a madwoman.\n'Second place! I must take second place!'\nThat thought consumed her mind entirely.\n\"Disciple Ju!\"\nAt that moment, someone's sharp voice broke her concentration and pierced her ears.\nTurning her head, she saw a woman she had encountered a few times in recent days.\n'Bang Mi-hwa, was it?'\nSince Ju Seo-yeon wasn't particularly interested in anyone besides Jin Ha-yeon, she wasn't even sure of the name of the person in front of her.\n\"What do you want?\" asked Ju Seo-yeon, making no effort to hide her annoyance, but Bang Mi-hwa paid no attention to it.\n\"What do you want?”\n\"I heard the rumors.\"\n\"What rumors?\"\n\"That you’re in love with the Young Master.\"\n\"...What?\"\nJu Seo-yeon was baffled, but Bang Mi-hwa didn't pay attention to her reaction at all.\n\"Give up.\"\n\"???\"\n\"He's already in love with me, so you'll only end up hurt, Disciple Ju.\"\n\"??????\"\n\"I just came to tell you that. Goodbye.\"\nHaving said her piece, Bang Mi-hwa turned and left.\nWatching her retreating figure, Ju Seo-yeon muttered.\n\"What a strange person.\"\nJu Seo-yeon quickly lost interest and returned to focusing on her training.\nIn her mind, there was only a rosy future with Jin Hayeon.\nAfter throwing off Ju Seoyeon by using Jin Hayeon as bait and resolving his problem with Bang Mi-hwa, Il-mok finally has a semblance of peace in his daily life.\nExcept for one madman who challenged him to a duel every day and one creepy instructor who kept trying to get close to him, all the problems bothering Il-mok had disappeared.\nTime passed quickly as he loafed around while trying his best to ignore those two problems.\nThen, on the day marked one month since he enrolled in the Hall, a change came to his repetitive routine.\n\"Today, we will test the progress you’ve made over the past month. Follow me closely.\"\nAfter saying this, Instructor Chu Il-hwan took the lead and headed toward the massive main gate of the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nThat main gate, which had been firmly locked for the past month, was wide open today.\nOn the way to the main gate, Il-mok turned his head and saw Instructor Eun Ryeo leading ten Lower Class students walking toward the same destination.\n‘Looks like the test will be conducted together with the Lower Class.’\nSince it didn’t matter that much to Il-mok, he quickly lost interest.\n\"As expected of Young Master Il-mok, you are so composed.\"\nBang Mi-hwa, having secured her spot on his left, approached with a radiant smile. She kept her gaze fixed straight ahead, showing only the right side of her face to Il-mok.\nUsed to her odd behavior, Il-mok replied.\n\"Being nervous won’t change anything.\"\n\"Hohoho. Indeed, we have much in common.\"\nBang Mi-hwa took Il-mok's attitude as a sign of confidence.\nWhile exchanging pointless conversation, they soon passed through the entrance of the Hall of the Demonic Way and arrived at a forest clearing where other instructors and assistants waited.\nSoon after, Instructor Eun Ryeo, leading the Lower Class students, arrived at the same location.\n\"This test will be conducted jointly by the Upper and Lower Classes. You will be divided into five groups of four.\"\n\"The disciples whose names I call now should come forward and follow their designated leader.\"\nSoon after, Instructors Chu Il-hwan and Eun Ryeo began calling the disciples’ names one by one.\nFour disciples at a time were led away into the forest by an instructor or assistant instructor.\n\"Too bad we’re not in the same group.\"\nBang Mi-hwa said this and left with Ha Young, who was coincidentally assigned to the same group.\n\"You won't escape this time!!\"\nDokgo Pae, who was also assigned to a different group from Il-mok, shouted like a third-rate villain as he departed into the forest.\nIl-mok's observation of the departing groups was simple.\n'Hmm. So they tried to balance the groups based on skill level?'\nThey weren’t grouped strictly by rank. Every group formed always consisted of two members from the Upper Class and two members from the Lower Class.\nIf it were based solely on rank, he and Dokgo Pae, the top two recruits, wouldn't be in separate groups.\nAs he pondered this, another group disappeared into the forest, leaving only four recruits, including Il-mok.\n\"The rest of you, follow me.\"\nInstructor Chu Il-hwan said this and stepped into the bushes, with Il-mok and the other three following behind.\nIl-mok was barely able to suppress his sigh as he confirmed the members of his group.\n\"I never thought we’d be in the same group, Young Master! I won’t disappoint you! Please choose me as your subordinate!\"\nJu Seo-yeon was practically swearing loyalty to him.\n\".......\"\nJeong Hyeon, trailing a few steps behind, kept opening and closing his mouth as if he had something to say to Il-mok.\nAnd as for the last member—\n\"I, I look forward to w-working with you, E-Eighth Y-Young Master... sir.\"\nIt was one of the three idiots who had picked a fight with Il-mok on his first day.\n'Choi Woong, was it?'\nHe was able to vaguely remember him since he was in the same class as Il-mok. Ju Seo-yeon and Jeong Hyeon on the other hand, belonged to the Lower Class.\n'Come to think of it, I heard Ju Seo-yeon barely scraped in entering the Hall. No wonder she got stuck with me.'\nThey had probably balanced the groups by pairing the top and bottom performers.\nResisting the urge to sigh, Il-mok forced himself to think positively.\n'Right. Anyway, this place is full of nothing but madmen or madmen-to-be. It doesn't matter which group I'm in.'\nWhile Il-mok was lost in self-hypnosis, Ju Seo-yeon, who finally got a chance after so long, launched another stalker rant to Il-mok.\nIf there was any silver lining to this situation, it was that Choi Woong kept his mouth shut and merely watched the situation out of fear. Jeong Hyeon on the other hand kept opening and closing his mouth like a fish, unable to muster enough courage to join the conversation.\nAfter enduring Ju Seo-yeon's endless chatter about Jin Ha-yeon for some time...\nChu Il-hwan, who was walking ahead, stopped.\n\"Now, I will explain the rules of this test.\"\nTurning around, Chu Il-hwan abruptly handed a scroll to Il-mok.\nCareful not to touch his fingers, Il-mok quickly snatched the scroll from the instructor’s hand.",

    "content": "Chapter 66: The First Test (1)\n“Ten tokens bearing a mark have been hidden throughout Taecheon Peak, where the Hall of the Demonic Way stands. The scroll contains a map marking the locations where five of these tokens are hidden. Your mission, starting now, is to collect as many of these tokens as possible.\"\nAfter explaining the test rules, Chu Il-hwan held out a wooden plaque for them to see.\n“The trial will last for eight hours. Points will be awarded based on the number of tokens acquired by each group.\"\nThe disciples nodded in understanding.\n'Gather as many as possible and secure second rank! Then I’ll be recognized by the Young Master and become Lady Jin Hayeon’s junior!’\nJu Seo-yeon's mind was filled with only one thought.\n'Phew. If we're looking for markers across this vast mountain, I probably won't have to meet many people, right?'\nJeong Hyeon was relieved at the prospect of encountering fewer people.\n‘Eight hours, he says? But that just means we have to run around like madmen to grab the tokens first, right? I hate sweating.’\nIl-mok was already annoyed.\nHe considered giving up halfway, but he couldn't bring himself to do it.\nIf word got back to his Master that he’d failed the first test due to laziness, there was no telling what terrible consequences might follow.\nHe pondered.\nHow could he achieve decent results without moving too much or breaking a sweat?\nThen, an idea struck him. He turned to Chu Il-hwan.\n\"Instructor, is combat prohibited in this test?\"\nHearing Il-mok's question, Chu Il-hwan grinned and replied.\n\"While you are competing, you are all fellow disciples. Anyone who kills or severely injures another will face severe punishment.\"\nAfter providing a few more explanations, Chu Il-hwan announced the start of the test and left.\nThe moment he was gone, Ju Seo-yeon and Choi Woong crowded around Il-mok, who held the scroll.\n\"Um, I also....\"\nJeong Hyeon mumbled in a barely audible voice, unable to bring himself to approach them. However, everyone was too focused on the scroll to hear him.\n\"It seems this one is the closest to our current position.\"\nExamining the map, Il-mok pointed to one of the marker locations.\nThanks to Instructor Eun’s lessons, reading the maps provided by the cult wasn’t difficult..\nLed by Il-mok, they used their lightweight movement techniques toward the location drawn on the map.\nThey pushed through thickets, passed towering trees and boulders, and soon arrived at the marked location.\n\"Let's search this area for now.\"\nAs they moved in unison following Il-mok's instructions, Ju Seo-yeon exclaimed in a lively tone, “Young Master! I found it! I found it!”\nShe was waving an object that looked exactly like the wooden tag Chu Il-hwan had shown them.\n\"Hahaha! At this rate, we could secure half of them within the first two hours!\"\nChoi Woong, who had been utterly terrified when first grouped with Il-mok, seemed to be in a better mood and burst into hearty laughter.\nHaving moved together as a team for a while, it seemed he now felt something akin to camaraderie towards the fearsome Young Master Il-mok. Believing Il-mok felt similarly, Choi Woong boldly addressed him.\n\"Young Master! Where's the next location? We should move quickly to secure it ahead of others!\"\n\"It will take a bit longer to reach the next location than it did for this one.\"\n\"Then we should move even faster before another group takes it! Or better yet, why don’t the four of us split up and quickly find the remaining four tokens?”\n“Splitting up is the worst possible move right now.”\n\"???\"\nChoi Woong had an expression of utter incomprehension, while Ju Seo-yeon and Jeong Hyeon tilted their heads in confusion.\n\"Think about it. Five groups of twenty people are searching for just ten tokens. Given the time it took us to find just one, all the tokens will likely be discovered in less than a two-hour period. Yet the test duration is a full eight hours. What does this mean?\"\nAs Ju Seo-yeon had no particular thoughts and Jeong Hyeon started to speak but stopped with a flinch, Choi Woong, the most level-headed among them, asked:\nIn place of the clueless Ju Seo-yeon and Jeong Hyeon, who flinched and stopped mid-sentence, Choi Woong, the only one coherent enough to respond, asked,\n\"…But didn’t Instructor Chu say combat is prohibited?\"\n\"Recall his words carefully. He said not to kill or seriously injure anyone, but he never said that about combat.\"\n\"!?\"\nIn truth, Il-mok hadn't asked about combat because of the long test duration.\n'I was just planning to laze around and beat up anyone I met to take their tokens.'\nRunning around like a madman was too much effort.\nBut Chu Il-hwan’s answer had sparked a realization, and finding the first token confirmed it.\n\"Let's assume all tokens are found within two hours. What if our group happens to have fewer tokens than the others, with six hours left? What would you do? Would you wait and accept failure? Or would you take a gamble?\"\n\"Ah....\"\nThis test was designed to incite conflict in the first place.\nFurthermore, didn't they mention that formations were set up outside the mountain in case any candidates lost their way? That was a warning that if you try too hard to avoid fights by just running away, you'll end up trapped in those formations.\"\nWhile Chu Il-hwan had said the formations were to prevent students from getting lost, he had also subtly warned that falling into them would result in automatic failure.\nJust then, Choi Woong asked with a puzzled expression.\n“There’s one thing I don’t understand. As Young Master must have also noticed, the groups were arranged with a certain balance in skill level. If everyone's skills are similar, subduing others without causing injury isn't easy. Of course, we'll end up fighting to avoid failing grades, but wouldn't that actually lead to injuries?\"\n“That would be the case if this were purely a martial test.\"\n\"???\"\n\"The purpose of this test is to evaluate what we've learned so far. That includes martial arts, external skills, and even the non-combat training from Instructor Eun Ryeo. We're meant to utilize all three aspects to collect as many tokens as possible.\"\nThis test was akin to guerrilla warfare across the entire mountain. It might start as a treasure hunt, but would likely evolve into a game of tag in the later stages.\n\"Whether you set traps, hide and ambush, or use tracking skills to find where others are hiding, there are various ways to gain an advantage in combat. The ban on killing or crippling others? Those are meant to force us to create overwhelming situations where we can subdue opponents without hurting them.\"\nImmediately after Il-mok finished speaking, a faint presence could be sensed amidst the distant foliage.\nSimultaneously, the gazes of all four members snapped towards the rustling leaves.\n\"Squeak?\"\nA rabbit poked its head out, tilted its head, and hopped away.\nIl-mok paid no attention to the rabbit and turned back to his group.\n“That’s why, simply moving quickly to the next location is meaningless.”\nWith that, Il-mok handed back the wooden plaque Ju Seo-yeon had given him.\n“Disciple Ju, keep this token slightly visible on your person. You will serve as bait. Word of your low entrance exam score has already spread, making you a juicy target.”\nIt was a blunt statement that basically said ‘you are weak,’ but Ju Seo-yeon didn't mind at all.\n\"I'll do my best, Young Master!\"\nHer only thought was to earn a high score and claim the second rank, even if it meant serving as bait.\n\"Disciple Choi, you will also act as bait alongside Disciple Ju.”\n“I don’t mind acting as bait, but will the other groups fall for it?”\nAt Choi Woong's observation, Il-mok let out a chuckle.\n\"Didn’t you suggest splitting up earlier?\"\n\"Ah!!\"\nRealizing his own stupidity, Choi Woong looked away in embarrassment.\n\"But if you're going to use bait, wouldn't it be better to use the Lower Class students?”\nHis gaze turned toward Jeong Hyeon, who was standing alone about ten feet away.\nAt Choi Woong’s suggestion, Il-mok grinned and strode over to Jeong Hyeon’s side.\nFlinch.\nIgnoring Jeong Hyeon's reaction, Il-mok patted his shoulder reassuringly and said.\n\"In this test, Disciple Jeong is our group's secret weapon.\"\nWatching Il-mok's confident expression which is drastically the opposite of Jeong Hyeon’s trembling face, a single thought dominated Choi Woong‘s head.\n'We're doomed.'\nHe didn’t dare say it aloud, though.\nAfter all, he still had nightmares about Il-mok beating him up.\nAfter Il-mok finished giving detailed instructions, they left the place where they had retrieved the token.\nMoments later...\n\"Phew.\"\nInstructor Chu Il-hwan emerged from near the bushes where the rabbit had appeared earlier.\n\"As expected, he has good instincts.\"\nChu Il-hwan's eyes gleamed as he recalled what had just transpired.\nHe hadn't expected anyone to figure out the purpose of this test so quickly.\nIt was astonishing that he had not only realized that this test wasn't simply about lightness skill and map-reading, but also encompassed all of what they had learned from the Hall.\n—The ban on killing or crippling others? Those are meant to force us to create situations where we can subdue opponents without hurting them.\nWhen he heard those words, Chu Il-hwan's control over his homicidal impulse slipped and he accidentally revealed his presence.\nTypically, young martial artists of his age tended to follow the explicitly stated conditions blindly.\nBut the youngest Young Master had precisely identified the instructors' intentions with terrifying accuracy.\nThe sight was so fascinating that Chu Il-hwan’s desire to toy with him grew.\n\"Phew.\"\nBarely suppressing the impulse, Chu Il-hwan once again began his pursuit, following the direction Il-mok’s group had taken.\n‘Good grief, I should switch groups with another instructor next time.'\nIn fact, Chu Il-hwan wasn't the only instructor shadowing the candidates using stealth techniques. Other instructors were also observing their assigned groups, ready to intervene in emergencies and evaluate performances.\nElsewhere, four disciples in black uniforms moved through the forest.\n\"Over there.\"\nThe man leading the group, confirming the location on the scroll, pointed ahead. The others approached the indicated area and began searching the vicinity.\n\"Someone's coming.\"\nAt the low murmur from one who had sensed a presence, the gazes of the four focused on one spot. Two disciples belonging to another group were approaching.\n\"Tsk. Someone got here first.\"\n“Let’s go to another spot!”\nNoticing the group, the two turned around and headed in a different direction.\nAs the group watched their retreating figures, one of the female disciples whispered something to her group.\n\"Did you see? Disciple Ju Seo-yeon had a token on her.\"\n\"What does that matter? Aren't we supposed to avoid combat?\"\n\"So what? We can’t fight.\"\n\"Think carefully. The instructor didn't forbid combat, he said not to kill or cause crippling injuries.\"\n\"!!\"\n“And Cadet Ju is ranked at the bottom even within the Lower Class. Four against two, with one being practically useless. We can subdue them without injuries.\"\nAs soon as she finished speaking, greed flickered in the eyes of the four disciples.\nThey exchanged glances and, without a word, bolted towards the direction where Ju Seo-yeon and Choi Woong had left.\nThe four quickly circled the two, forming a tight encirclement.\n\"What do you think you're doing?\"\n“We are forbidden from combat!”\nTheir questions were met not with words, but with violence..\n\"Haaah!\"\nThe four unleashed a flurry of attacks, wielding swords, sabers, fists, and staffs, relentlessly pressing Choi Woong and Ju Seo-yeon.\n\"How dare you!\"\nChoi Woong, befitting as someone from the Upper Class, managed to withstand the combined assault of two opponents, but Ju Seo-yeon found herself increasingly overwhelmed.\nShe was only able to hold out because her opponents were trying to subdue her without causing injury.\nClang!\nAs one disciple's saber deflected her spear, Ju Seo-yeon's stance completely collapsed.\n\"Haaah!\"\nWith a powerful shout, the woman who had been coordinating the attack extended her hand toward Ju Seo-yeon's pressure point, employing a grappling technique.\nJust as her fingers were about to strike Ju Seo-yeon's paralysis point—\nSwoosh!\nIl-mok burst from a nearby bush, hurtling towards the woman with incredible speed.\nFrom the moment the battle began, Il-mok had already deployed his stealth technique to the fullest, allowing him to close the distance without being noticed.\n“Damn it!”\nThe man who had deflected Ju Seo-yeon's spear cried out in alarm and swung his saber to help the woman.\nOr at least, he thought he did.\nThud!\n\"Urgh!?\"\nHe winced as a delayed jolt of pain shot through him from his paralyzing point. His body began to go numb, and his eyes frantically scanned his surroundings.\n'...When?'\nIt was then that his gaze fell upon an arrow lying on the ground nearby. Its tip was deliberately blunted.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 67",
    "content": "Chapter 67: The First Test (2)\nUpon reaching the designated location using his stealth, Jeong Hyeon took a deep breath and steadied his mind.\n'Phew.'\nClang!\nThrough the gaps between the bushes and trees, he could see two decoys just now engaging in combat with disciples from another group.\nWatching the scene, Jeong Hyeon calmly raised his bow and drew an arrow.\nHis movements were surprisingly silent, releasing neither presence nor sound. But instead of just focusing on his bow, his mind wandered elsewhere.\n'I don't want to disappoint him.'\nJeong Hyeon was recalling what had happened earlier.\n\"Our team's secret weapon is none other than Disciple Jeong.\"\nFrom their very first meeting until now, he has shown nothing but pathetic displays of himself. Yet, for some reason, Young Master Il-mok regarded him as a truly capable martial artist.\nThe feeling when his only friend patted his shoulder while uttering those words is still vivid in his mind.\nHe cringed inwardly, remembering how pathetically he had trembled at that moment.\nSo. At least in this moment.\n‘I don't want to disappoint the first friend I've ever made.’\n\"Hoo.\"\nAfter taking a very light breath, he concentrated.\nThe moment he concentrated, all his senses sharpened.\nEvery nerve flared, and the world seemed to slow down. Although the distance was easily over ten zhang (approximately 30 meters), cluttered with bushes and trees, the battlefield felt absurdly close, as if it were right in front of him.\nThis was the effect of the Demonic Art, Ghostly Spirit Divine Bow.\nThese unbearably acute senses were precisely what caused him to nearly have breakdowns whenever people or animals approached too closely.\nBecause of this, everyone had left him.\nAll except one. Young Master Il-mok.\nSwish!\nWithin the slowing world, Ju Seo-yeon's spear slowly lifted upwards.\nAnd just as the female cadet executed her grappling technique towards the now off-balance Ju Seo-yeon…\nRustle.\nIl-mok, who had stealthily approached nearby, drew his sword and lunged.\nSimultaneously, the disciple who had knocked aside Ju Seo-yeon's spear began swinging his blade.\n'Now!'\nHis hyper-focused senses seemed to predict the immediate future.\nThrough observing the disciple's posture as he swung his blade and the subtle muscle movements visible beneath his clothes, Jeong Hyeon visualized exactly how the man would be positioned when his arrow arrived.\nThe arrow left his bow without even a whisper of sound, flying perfectly toward the single pressure point on the disciple's paralyzing point.\nToo many things happen at once.\nThe female disciple’s grappling technique aimed at Ju Seo-yeon successfully struck her paralyzing point.\nPat.\nBut at the same moment, Il-mok's finger struck the female disciple's own paralyzing point.\nIt was truly a perfectly timed ambush.\nThe female disciple couldn’t even react to Il-mok's ambush due to being too focused on Ju Seo-yeon.\nIn the end, both Ju Seo-yeon and that female disciple had their pressure points sealed almost simultaneously.\n\"Kuk.\"\nThe male disciple swinging his saber also had his paralyzing point struck by a blunt-tipped arrow, freezing mid-swing.\n\"Young Master! I did it! I succeeded as bait!\"\nDespite having her acupoint sealed, Ju Seo-yeon boasted proudly, causing Il-mok to let out a hollow laugh.\n'It would have been better if they struck on her mute point rather than her paralyzing point.'\nShaking his head to clear the stray thought, Il-mok turned his gaze towards the two disciples who had paused their attack on Choi Woong.\n\"Will you surrender quietly and hand over your tokens? Or do you prefer to resist and have them taken by force?\"\nIl-mok's suggestion was born from a desire not to exert unnecessary effort, but after a moment's hesitation, the two suddenly turned to flee.\n\"Tsk.\"\nOf course, Il-mok wasn't foolish enough to just let his targets escape.\nIn an instant, Il-mok closed the distance and began pressuring the two with the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\n\"You cheating bastards!\"\nChoi Woong, seizing the opportunity for revenge, joined the fight with a fiery glint in his eyes.\n'Who's calling who a cheater now?'\nIl-mok nearly laughed aloud, remembering how Choi Woong had been one of the three who ganged up on him on his second day.\nAlready struggling against Il-mok alone, the two disciples found themselves further pressured by Choi Woong's relentless saber attacks.\n\"Kuk.\"\nWith the addition of near-silent arrows flying from seemingly nowhere, their pressure points were swiftly neutralized.\n\"Check the spoils. I'll go release Disciple Ju's pressure point.\"\nAfter giving instructions to Choi Woong, Il-mok approached Ju Seo-yeon and released her acupoint.\n\"Disciple Ju, check the female disciple's body.\"\nRustle.\nWhile resting after giving instructions, Jeong Hyeon quietly approached from where he'd been providing support fire, though he still stopped about three meters away.\n\"I knew I could count on you, Disciple Jeong.\"\nWhen Il-mok smiled at Jeong Hyeon who was fidgeting from a distance, Jeong Hyeon bowed his head deeply and mumbled something in a small voice.\n\"Found it, Young Master!\"\n\"Here's another one, Young Master!\"\nBut his words were buried under Ju Seo-yeon and Choi Woong's loud reports.\n\"With this, we've collected three tokens.\"\n\"Yes, Young Master. And we've secured the map these people received from the instructor. There are two places marked that weren't on the map we received.\"\n“Then let’s proceed to one of those locations using the same strategy.”\nAs Il-mok spoke, Ju Seo-yeon nodded vigorously, and Jeong Hyeon nervously responded with a quiet yes.\n\"But what should we do with them?\"\nSurprisingly, Choi Woong asked a sensible question.\n\"Just leave them hidden somewhere. If we free them, they might join other groups for revenge.\"\n\"Isn't that... dangerous? Even if they're martial artists of the Divine Cult, if they encounter wild animals while their acupoints are sealed, they could die.\"\nIl-mok shrugged at Choi Woong's concern.\n“Someone will probably retrieve them after we leave. Honestly, with rules that encourage fighting like this, there must be instructors stationed around to prevent accidents.\"\nScanning their surroundings, he added, \"In fact, an instructor might have been watching this whole fight.\"\nAfter moving for about 30 minutes, they arrived at another location where a token was hidden.\nWhether by good or bad luck, they encountered no other groups, but the token was already gone.\n\"It seems someone got here first.\"\n“Should we move to the next location right away?”\nIl-mok shook his head at Ju Seo-yeon and Choi Woong's questions.\n\"About two hours have passed since the test began. Since this one's already taken, there probably aren't any markers left.\"\n\"Then should I act as bait again?\"\nSeeing Ju Seo-yeon volunteering to be a decoy, Il-mok shook his head.\n\"There are still six hours left in the test, so we should eat first.\"\nThis time, no one questioned his decision.\nHaving adapted somewhat, they had begun to grasp his intentions.\n'He must be planning to rest now and strike later when others are tired.'\nAn eight-hour test on the mountain meant that the Hall wouldn't provide meals to the disciples. By eating now, they could take advantage of others' hunger later.\nChoi Woong's assumption was only half-correct. For origınal chapters go to novel•ﬁre.net\n‘Four groups remaining. Ten tokens total. Since we already have three, we can take it easy for now. We just need to ambush one more group to secure at least second place.'\nIn fact, Il-mok's biggest goal was simply to laze around. Maintaining their current status seemed sufficient to secure a high rank.\n\"To avoid being ambushed while eating, let's move as far away as possible from the marked locations. On the way, it would be good to catch an animal or two to roast and eat.\"\n\"By the way, is there anyone skilled in hunting or gathering?\"\nIn response to Il-mok's question, Ju Seo-yeon simply smiled with a dumb expression, and Choi Woong subtly avoided Il-mok's gaze.\n'Good for nothing except being decoys.'\nAs Il-mok was thinking that. A small voice reached his ears.\n\"Um...\"\nTurning his head, he saw Jeong Hyeon, standing three meters away with his head bowed, raising his right hand.\n\"I… I have s-some experience, Young Master.\"\nA smile spread across Il-mok's face.\n\"Hahaha! As expected, Disciple Jeong is the star of this test! You're our only hope!\"\nAfter showering Jeong Hyeon with praise, Il-mok shot disappointed looks at Ju Seo-yeon and Choi Woong.\n\"Ahem.\"\nEmbarrassed, Choi Woong turned his head to avoid that gaze.\n\"Hahaha. Well done, Disciple Jeong!\"\nWhile Ju Seo-yeon remained cheerfully oblivious.\nThe group moved toward the mountain's outskirts as they examined the map.\nAlong the way, Jeong Hyeon would occasionally disappear from the group to hunt game or gather fruits and mushrooms before quietly reappearing.\nIt was a bizarre sight.\n\"When did you leave?\"\nWith his naturally faint presence and habit of maintaining distance, no one noticed when Jeong Hyeon slipped away. Only when he reappeared later holding something did they notice with surprise and ask.\nAfter about thirty minutes, they reached the outskirts and prepared lunch.\nSome prepared the animals Jeong Hyeon had hunted, while others carefully started a fire.\nBy the time preparations were complete, about three hours had passed since the start of the test.\nAs hunger set in, they enjoyed their meal in relaxed spirits.\nJeong Hyeon, as always, quietly enjoyed his meal at a slight distance, while Ju Seo-yeon chattered endlessly to Il-mok about Jin Hayeon.\nListening to her prattle, Il-mok suddenly grew curious.\n\"By the way, when did you first meet Miss Jin?\"\nJu Seo-yeon's eyes sparkled as she replied.\n\"Actually, my father is one of the shadows of the Dark Shadow Pavilion. Because of that, I occasionally had opportunities to meet people from the Dark Shadow Pavilion or visit there.\"\n\"So, did you meet Miss Jin there?\"\n\"Yes! Two years ago, when Miss Jin had just entered the Dark Shadow Pavilion, I happened to visit with my father and saw her!\"\nJu Seo-yeon launched into a lengthy explanation of how she became obsessed.\n\"I never imagined someone so noble and elegant could exist! So, I asked my father.\"\n\"After hearing my father's story, I fell for Miss Jin even more. Unlike her noble appearance, she started in harsh conditions and through effort reached the second seat in the Hall. Her story was so moving.\"\n\"My father said I should follow her example to become a great martial artist and join the Pavilion too.\"\nListening to her elaborate story, Il-mok thought.\n‘Two years ago. That means she was fourteen at that time. An age where children are easily led astray.’\nFourteen by Western count. Roughly equivalent to a second or third year of middle school in Korea. At that age, falling into such an obsession seemed plausible.\nHer father's encouragement likely played a role as well.\n'Though this likely wasn't the outcome he wanted.'\nHe'd probably hoped to inspire his daughter with a role model. The problem was that Ju Seo-yeon had received a different kind of inspiration.\nJust then, Choi Woong, who had also been listening to Ju Seo-yeon's story, spoke up with a somewhat bewildered expression.\n“Just to be clear, this Jin Hayeon is a woman, right?”\n\"That's right. The most elegant, noble woman in the world!\"\nFacing Ju Seo-yeon, who was enthusiastically promoting her idol to him, Choi Woong asked with a baffled expression.\n\"So... Disciple Ju likes another woman?\"\nHis face was filled with confusion.\n'Well, I guess it might be a difficult preference to accept in this world?'\nWhile Il-mok was thinking that, surprisingly, it was Ju Seo-yeon who looked at Choi Woong with a baffled look.\n\"Don't you admire the Heavenly Demon?\"\n\"O-Of course! How could anyone not revere the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons?!\"\n\"But the Heavenly Demon is a man like you, isn't he?\"\n\"!?\"\n\"I just feel the same. The person I respect most is the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons; Miss Jin is the second. Her gender doesn't matter.\"\nWatching Ju Seo-yeon's fanatical expression, Il-mok wondered if her feelings were truly pure admiration.\nBut that wasn't important right now.\n\"Now that we've eaten and rested, we should start moving.\"\nIl-mok stood up, fearing that Choi Woong might fall into a state of Qi Deviation if they continued.\nNot that he cared about Choi Woong.\nHe just didn’t want to deal with a rampaging madman.",

    "content": "Chapter 68: The First Test (3)\nSomewhere on Taecheon Peak, where the first test was underway...\nThud.\n\"Ugh...\"\nLooking down at the disciple who had collapsed after being struck at their paralyzing point, Dokgo Pae sneered.\n\"Tch. Idiots.\"\nBeside the fallen disciple lay another, equally defeated.\nDespite the groups being divided into four-person teams, these two had been moving entirely on their own.\nThe reason was simple. To collect tokens quickly, they had split up to move separately.\nUnlike Il-mok’s group, which had used two members as bait while the others lay in ambush, these two had genuinely split off on their own, and that was their downfall. They had encountered Dokgo Pae's group and been swiftly subdued.\nMeanwhile, the other three disciples in Dokgo Pae's group were looking at him with incredulous expressions.\n‘He had the exact same idea earlier.’\n‘How can someone be this shameless?!’\nIn truth, when they first heard the rules, Dokgo Pae had made the exact same suggestion and even a more extreme one.\nHe had insisted that they split into four immediately to gather tokens as quickly as possible.\n'I must achieve a higher score than the Eighth Young Master!'\nThe only thought in Dokgo Pae's mind was to surpass Il-mok.\nFortunately for them, Dokgo Pae's recklessness was stopped by the objection of another team member.\n\"If we split up and run into the Eighth Young Master’s group, what then?\"\n\"Hmph! The rules don't forbid combat, do they? I'd like to defeat the Eighth Young Master in a direct confrontation, but if those are the rules, isn't moving first the best option?\"\nDokgo Pae believed this test was in his favor.\nOn the first day at the Hall of the Demonic Way, he had at least won in the competition of lightness skill.\nHowever, his teammates' subsequent objections forced him to reconsider.\n\"They didn’t prohibit combat. They only said not to inflict serious injuries. That means subduing is allowed. No matter how skilled you are, you couldn’t possibly face the Eighth Young Master’s entire team alone.”\n\"...Ahem. We-well, if it were just the Eighth Young Master alone, I might manage, maybe, but if they cheat and gang up on me, it won’t be easy.\"\nDue to his pride, Dokgo Pae couldn't bring himself to admit that he might lose to the Eighth Young Master.\nIn any case, thanks to that teammate's wisdom, Dokgo Pae's team avoided the folly of splitting up.\n\"These idiots had two tokens on them.\"\n\"Hahaha! Moving separately must have sped them up!\"\nTheir faces brightened as they discovered two tokens after searching the bodies of the two men they had subdued.\nThey had only found one token so far because they were moving together as a group of four.\nAfter gathering the spoils, Dokgo Pae barked,\n\"Then, let's move to the next location!\"\nHe strode ahead as if he were the undisputed leader, prompting the other three to sigh quietly..\n\"Ugh. We got stuck with the worst.\"\n\"Why does he keep taking the lead when he can’t even read the map properly?\"\n“Thanks to him we got lost repeatedly and could only find one token after all this time.”\nIn fact, one of the main reasons they had gathered tokens slowly was because of Dokgo Pae's temperament.\nWhile skilled in martial arts, he had never excelled in Instructor Eun’s classes due to his single-minded devotion to strength.\nHe had learned map-reading to some extent, but there were flaws in his understanding.\nYet he was often overconfident, and this frequently led them on the wrong path.\n\"Well, as long as we let him play the role of leader, he's satisfied. So, let's just observe for now.\"\nWhen the disciple who had insisted on staying together with Dokgo Pae said this, the other two nodded.\nThough stubborn, Dokgo Pae could be managed with the right coaxing.\nHonestly, having some kind of leader was better than none at all.\nWhen opinions diverged, having someone who pushed strongly was necessary to get anything done.\nAnd so, they continued under Dokgo Pae’s \"leadership.\"\nDokgo Pae would take the lead, and whenever he veered off course, the other three gently steered him back.\nBut as time passed, they arrived at another marked location only to find it empty.\n\"Tch. Nothing here either. Let's move to the next location!\"\nAs Dokgo Pae clicked his tongue in disappointment and quickly prepared to move again—\n\"!!!\"\nThey spotted another team through the bushes.\nBut it was different from before.\nThis team was moving together as a group of four.\nFurthermore—\n\"Tsk. An ambush would be difficult.\"\nThe other group had noticed them too.\nTension thickened instantly.\nIn an atmosphere where a single wrong move could spark a fight—\nA female disciple from the other side stepped forward boldly.\nThe woman who stepped forward with a proud and haughty gait was Bang Mi-hwa.\nDokgo Pae recognized her. They were in the same class after all, not only that, the Upper class only had ten members within. But that wasn’t the reason why he remembered her.\n‘The woman clinging to the Eighth Young Master.’\nShe had stuck in his memory solely because of her closeness to the one person who piqued his interest.\nBut the words that came out of her mouth exceeded Dokgo Pae's expectations.\n\"Since we've encountered each other by fate, how about forming a temporary alliance?\"\n\"A temporary alliance? Why?\"\n\"With the Eighth Young Master’s group as the strongest contender, it would be wise to join forces first.\"\nDokgo Pae and his teammates could understand what she meant.\nDeal with Il-mok's team first, and then compete amongst themselves afterward.\nHowever, Dokgo Pae couldn't trust her words.\n\"Hmph. How can I trust the words of someone who's been sticking with the Eighth Young Master like glue for the past month?\"\n\"Because both he and I know how to separate personal feelings from duty.\"\nBang Mi-hwa was confident. She truly believed Il-mok’s affection for her wouldn’t waver over something so trivial.\nBang Mi-hwa genuinely believed so, but the problem was Dokgo Pae.\nHe bared his teeth in a savage grin.\n\"Hmph. Such petty tactics don't suit the eldest grandson of the great Dokgo Family. I’ll crush you all here and take your tokens, then defeat the Eighth Young Master in a fair fight!\"\nThe moment his taunt ended, both sides drew their weapons simultaneously, creating an intense atmosphere.\n\"What a fool.\"\nBang Mi-hwa flicked open her fan, subtly covering the left side of her jaw to highlight her \"perfect\" right profile.\nSomewhere along the way, she had convinced herself that only her right side was her true face.\nOnly the more beautiful, more perfect version of herself was the real her.\nOf course, Dokgo Pae, who couldn’t care less, was about to swing his sword when a voice from behind stopped him.\n\"Team Leader Dokgo. Wasn't your goal the Eighth Young Master? Fighting them here now would be a mistake.\"\nDokgo Pae stopped his sword and focused on the disciple’s words.\nUntil now, he had simply called him a disciple, but this time, he had addressed him as 'Team Leader,' which caught his attention.\n\"Why?\"\nNow that he’d been addressed as such, Dokgo Pae naturally spoke condescendingly.\n\"Engaging them risks injuries on our side. And if you injure them, you might be disqualified before even facing the Eighth Young Master.\"\nSeeing the validity in that point, Dokgo Pae clicked his tongue lightly and withdrew his sword.\n\"Tsk. I'll deal with you lot after I defeat the Eighth Young Master.\"\nAs if he had finished his business, Dokgo Pae proudly turned his back and walked in the opposite direction.\nDokgo Pae's teammates also began to follow him, leaving Bang Mi-hwa’s team to watch their retreating backs.\n\"Mi-hwa, wouldn't it be better to ambush them now?\"\nBang Mi-hwa shook her head haughtily at her friend Ha Young's suggestion.\n“It’s not worth the risk. We’ll only suffer losses fighting them.”\n“But wouldn’t it be easier to deal with them than the Eighth Young Master’s group?”\n“Dokgo Pae has no chance of defeating the Eighth Young Master. If they eliminate each other, our ranking will improve.”\n\"But we might also be defeated by the Eighth Young Master.\"\n“I have a plan for that, don’t worry.”\nHa Young nodded at her confident friend’s reply with an \"as expected\" expression.\n\".......\"\nMeanwhile, the two Lower Class disciples behind them could only exchange uneasy glances as they listened to the conversation.\nSome time after encountering Bang Mi-hwa’s group—\n\"Tsk. Nothing here either.\"\nDokgo Pae clicked his tongue as he arrived at another location following the map.\nAt that moment, the disciple who had been acting as the team's strategist spoke up.\n\"It seems all tokens have already been collected, Team Leader. From now on, it will be a battle to steal the tokens that everyone has already obtained.\"\n\"Hmm. That's actually better. Rather than this trivial treasure hunting, fighting is more suited to my style. Hahaha.\"\nSeeing Dokgo Pae’s boorish laughter, the disciple who acted as the strategist mustered a strained smile and said.\n“In that case, shouldn’t we prepare a meal?”\n\"A meal? What do you mean?\"\n“I have full faith in you, Team Leader, but facing the Eighth Young Master on an empty stomach would be risky.\"\n\"Oh.\"\n\"Also, since only the Team Leader can match the Eighth Young Master, the final showdown will ultimately be between you and him.\"\n\"Ohhhh!\"\nEventually, Dokgo Pae, swayed by the disciple’s words, decided to have lunch.\n\"Then, go find food immediately!\"\nAs the leader, Dokgo Pae believed he had no need to handle such menial tasks himself.\nWhile the others searched the forest for food…\n\"Haah.\"\nThe disciple who had been acting as the strategist, Gwak Sul, let out a soft sigh.\nIn truth, he had no intention of letting Dokgo Pae face Il-mok. Based on past observations, it was almost certain that Dokgo Pae would lose.\n‘...Since Disciple Dokgo has no talent for tracking, it would be best to subtly mislead him into encountering another group.’\nGwak Sul still regretted not accepting Bang Mi-hwa's proposal. However, it was futile to try to fix what Dokgo Pae had already messed up.\nAfter organizing his thoughts, he began searching for food, wandering aimlessly through the forest.\nBy the time Gwak Sul and the other two had finished hunting and gathering, about an hour had passed.\nUnlike Il-mok’s group, which had Jeong Hyeon, none of them had any prior experience with hunting or gathering.\nThey barely managed to complete it in one hour thanks to their martial arts training, which allowed them to move faster than most animals, and their basic tracking skills, which helped them successfully hunt.\nBy the time they had prepared the food, started the fire, prepared the animal, and finished preparing the meal, 4 hours had passed since the beginning of the test.\n“Hahaha. Disciple Gwak was right. It was wise to eat beforehand.”\nNot just Dokgo Pae, but the other three were also completely famished by now.\n\"Dig in.\"\nDokgo Pae, now fully accustomed to his role as leader, gave the order naturally.\nBut just as he was about to bring the freshly roasted piece of meat into his mouth—\nRustle.\nThrough the bushes, they spotted a man and a woman running toward them.\n\"Damn it.\"\n\"Son of a—\"\n\"They must have a death wish.\"\nAs two of the teammates and Dokgo Pae scowled, taking their hands off the meat and grabbing their weapons—\n\"Something's wrong!\"\nGwak Sul shouted, looking at the approaching pair.\n“There are four of us, and only two of them are charging!? Something's not right!\"\nAs everyone felt uneasy at Gwak Sul's astute observation—\nWhoosh! Newest update provıded by novel~fire~net\nSuddenly, Il-mok appeared from a nearby bush and charged toward Dokgo Pae.\nAt the exact moment everyone’s attention was fixed on the sudden appearance of Il-mok—\nTwang!\n\"Gah....\"\nAn arrow, seemingly appearing out of nowhere, struck one of the candidates at a vital point, causing him to collapse.\nTwang!\nOnly then did Dokgo Pae, whose sword had clashed with Il-mok's, shout with a face twisted in anger.\n“You’re both the same kind of treacherous bitch and bastard!!”\nTo Dokgo Pae, Bang Mi-hwa, who had proposed an alliance to catch Il-mok, and Il-mok, who had ambushed them while they were eating, were the same kind of despicable people.\nOf course, Il-mok, who knew nothing of the incident with Bang Mi-hwa, could only swing his sword with a bewildered expression.",

    "novel_title": "So, Did Someone Force You to Become the Heavenly Demon",
    "chapter_number": "Chapter 69",
    "content": "Chapter 69: The First Trial (4)\nOne hour earlier.\nI got to my feet and said, \"First, let's head to a location we haven't checked yet.\"\n“Won’t they all have been collected by now?\"\n\"That's exactly why we're going. If someone's been there, there should be traces left.\"\n\"Ah!\"\nSeeing that everyone understood, I checked the map and began to lead the way.\nAmong the team members, Jeong Hyeon was also skilled at reading maps, but he wasn't the type to take the lead.\nWe walked through the forest path for a while.\n\"Someone's definitely been here.\"\nFollowing the traces left behind, we began tracking.\n\"Th-this way, Y-Young Master.\"\nAnd when it came to tracking, Jeong Hyeon provided the greatest assistance.\n'Hehehe. Once we take care of this group, we're practically guaranteed a top ranking.'\nAs I thought about lazing around in hiding after this one fight, we continued following the traces for a while.\n\"......\"\nAt some point, there was no longer any need for Jeong Hyeon to lead the way.\nThe trail was far too obvious.\nWhile I couldn't help but chuckle at tracks that practically screamed, 'Come catch me,' Jeong Hyeon, who was keeping about a hundred paces distance, voiced his opinion in a voice as soft as an ant crawling.\n\"I-It looks like th-they're p-preparing a m-meal.\"\nThe forest path was in disarray, and bloodstains and animal fur suggested they'd been hunting. It was a perfectly reasonable deduction.\n\"This is our chance.\"\nI nodded and briefly outlined our detailed strategy.\n\"Jeong Hyeon, track their location and find a good sniping position. I'll stealthily approach. Meanwhile, I'll approach as close as possible using stealth techniques. When I'm close, our two baits—no, Choi Woong and Ju Seo-yeon—will make noise as a distraction.\"\nHaving done this before, the team members nodded and immediately went into action.\nAs I approached the location Jeong Hyeon had found using stealth techniques, I could see faint smoke rising above the trees. It seemed to be from a fire for cooking meat.\nTruthfully, we could've just ambushed them during their meal without this elaborate plan.\nI alone could handle two or three of them on my own, especially in a situation where they didn’t expect an ambush.\nYet, the reason I was being so cautious wasn't to give my team members a chance to shine...\n'What a hassle.'\n…but because I didn't want to sweat and reveal my full capabilities yet.\nAs I got closer to the unsuspecting group, their faces came into view.\nThe first one I recognized was, of course, Dokgo Pae.\nJust as he was about to grab a piece of cooked meat, his gaze shifted towards the direction of the approaching distraction created by the two baits.\nAmid everyone's surprise, one rather clever-looking fellow suddenly shouted, \"There are four of us, but only two of them are charging in! Something's not right!\"\nAs they began to question this, 'Now!'\nWithout hesitation, I released my stealth technique and rushed toward Dokgo Pae.\nAt the same time, an arrow shot by Jeong Hyeon took down one of the disciples who was surprised by my appearance.\nClang!\n“You’re both the same kind of treacherous bitch and bastard!!”\nDokgo Pae, whose sword clashed with mine, spouted some nonsense.\nOf course, it was none of my business.\nSwish.\nJust as Dokgo Pae, his face red with anger, tried to overpower me with his signature forceful swordsmanship, I, having anticipated this, used his momentum against him and redirected the path of his blade.\nNaturally, his stance crumbled.\nThud!\nSeizing the opening, I struck his pressure point.\nWhile I handled Dokgo Pae, Choi Woong and Ju Seo-yeon each engaged another opponent.\n\"Choi Woong! Since when did you become so petty?!\"\nUpon a closer look, I recognized the man who was complaining to Choi Woong with an indignant expression. He was among the trio who got beaten up by me on my second day here.\nHe seemed quite upset about being backstabbed by a friend.\nOf course, that too was none of my business.\nThud!\nI quietly approached the man fighting Choi Woong and struck him with the flat of my sword, then pressed the acupuncture point of the fallen man.\n\"Ugh...\"\nAt the same time, the seemingly clever strategist collapsed after being hit by Ju Seo-yeon's spear.\nIt wasn't solely due to her skill. Jeong Hyeon's arrows, providing cover from afar, had kept the strategist occupied, allowing the slightly weaker Ju Seo-yeon to subdue him.\n‘It seems her recent dedicated training has paid off.’\nAt the time when that unpleasant rumor was circulating, Ju Seo-yeon was undoubtedly the weakest disciple within the Hall.\nIt seemed she had managed to grow, albeit slightly, in just about twenty days.\n\"Young Master! I took down one of them! Aren't I useful?\"\nHer eyes gleamed with a manic light while she called out like a puppy seeking praise.\n'So this is the power of obsession.'\nI almost feel bad for Jin Hayeon.\n‘Well, achieving the second rank will still be difficult for her, though.’\nDismissing the thought, I instructed Choi Woong and Ju Seo-yeon.\n“Now, let's collect our spoils.”\nUnderstanding my intention, they began thoroughly searching the bodies of the four paralyzed disciples.\nChoi Woong, being another man, was one thing, but Ju Seo-yeon was also rummaging through the bodies of unfamiliar men without the slightest hesitation.\nWell, from Ju Seo-yeon’s perspective, they're probably no different from logs.\nMeanwhile, Jeong Hyeon, who had been providing support from a distance, returned.\n“Young Master! Dokgo Pae had all three!”\nChoi Woong, who was searching on Dokgo Pae's body, exclaimed with an expression of utter joy as he waved three tokens.\nA smile also appeared on my face.\n\"That makes six now.\"\nSix out of ten. First place was already guaranteed. Then there was only one thing left to do.\n'Now I just need to find a good hiding spot and relax until the test ends.’\nThat's what I thought.\nSomehow, this test feels more relaxing than attending classes.\nAround the time Dokgo Pae's group was being ambushed…\nBang Mi-hwa and her team members were also enjoying their meal.\nJust then, one of the candidates, holding a piece of meat but hesitant to eat, cautiously asked Bang Mi-hwa, \"Will you really keep your promise?\"\nTo that question, Bang Mi-hwa replied with her characteristically confident smile, \"What a silly question. If we collect all ten tokens, giving you one is no issue.\"\nAfter answering, Bang Mi-hwa swept her gaze over her team members. Strangely, there were five disciples together, including herself.\nThe reason was simple.\nJust as Dokgo Pae had hunted down two separated members and seized their tokens, the remaining two members of that team had also been discovered by Bang Mi-hwa's group.\nAnd instead of subduing both, Bang Mi-hwa made a proposal to one of them.\n—If you cooperate with us until the end of this test, I'll return one token to you. If the five of us subdue all the other teams, you can still secure second place with just one token.\nIt was an enticing proposal to betray his team—or rather, to survive alone and make his team achieve second place.\nIn the end, that disciple had no choice but to accept Bang Mi-hwa's proposal.\nThe reason she only made the offer to one of the two was simple.\nTo reduce the risk of backstabbing.\nShe judged that if they were traveling with two potential traitors and encountered the other half of their original team, handling a betrayal would become difficult.\nNot knowing that Dokgo Pae's group had subdued the remaining two and taken their tokens, she had no choice but to make such a judgment.\nJust then, Ha Young, who had been listening quietly, asked.\n“Since there are five of us, we should be able to handle Dokgo Pae’s group easily, but what about the Eighth Young Master’s group?”\nIn truth, they had recruited the member from the other group after their encounter with Dokgo Pae’s team. If they had already been five strong at that time, there would have been no reason to simply let Dokgo Pae’s group leave.\n\"You mentioned earlier that you had a plan?\"\nAt Ha Young's question, the other team members also turned their heads toward Bang Mi-hwa.\nA strategy to deal with the Eighth Young Master, the top student of this class and undeniably the strongest, naturally piqued their curiosity.\nPleased that all attention was focused on her again, Bang Mi-hwa smiled confidently.\n\"Hohoho. It's simple. Young Master Il-mok is infatuated with me, so he won't be able to attack easily. That’s why while I keep him occupied, the rest of you can take care of the others.\"\n\"As expected of Mi-hwa!\"\nHa Young, her friend, exclaimed in admiration at her audacious claim.\n\"......\"\nThe other three simply stared at the two dumbfounded expressions.\nHowever, no one stepped forward to point out her delusion.\nPartly because they didn't want to create discord in the team.\n‘Well, with five of us, we should be able to manage somehow, right?’\nAnd because one way or another, they thought they had the advantage.\nIn a secluded corner of Taecheon Peak where the test was taking place…\nIl-mok and his team members were leisurely enjoying their rest.\nHaving collected six of the ten tokens, first place was basically guaranteed.\n'Hehehe. If I’m in the same group as the Eighth Young Master next time, I can keep getting good results!'\nChoi Woong, who had initially been fearful of being in the same team as Il-mok, was now gleefully realizing that being with Il-mok meant an abundance of benefits.\n'I'm going all the way to second rank and making the Young Master impressed! Just wait a little longer, Miss Hayeon!'\nJu Seo-yeon, equally pleased with the results, was lost in her fantasies about Jin Hayeon, wearing a disturbingly manic grin.\nOblivious to their antics, Il-mok was relaxing some distance away, enjoying the peace and quiet.\n\"......\"\nJeong Hyeon was also alone, savoring his solitude.\n\"Um, excuse me...\"\nOr rather, he kept trying to muster the courage to speak, hoping to become a little closer during this peaceful moment, but his voice would trail off into a mumble, and he would sink back into silence.\nJust then, Jeong Hyeon, who had been too nervous to speak until now, abruptly stood up.\nIt wasn't that he had gained courage. It was because something serious had arisen.\n\"S-Someone is ap-approaching.\"\nHis voice was still barely a whisper, but his sudden movement drew everyone's attention.\nWhile they were taking a break, they didn’t completely let their guard down.\nThey had made minimal preparations in case of an ambush.\nSince inflicting injuries was forbidden, they had set up simple traps that would make a small noise if someone triggered them. And with his sensitive senses, Jeong Hyeon had not missed that noise, alerting them to the approach of enemies, and then carefully moved to a new position.\nHe had repositioned himself to a location more suitable for archery in case of a fight.\nIl-mok and the other two also prepared themselves while he moved.\nIl-mok tilted his head as he observed the enemies approaching through the bushes.\n'Five?'\nIt was strange to see a group of five in a test designed for groups of four. But Il-mok could roughly understand the situation.\n‘Did they form a temporary alliance?’\nHe didn't know the specifics, nor did he need to know the reason for their alliance.\nThe important thing now was to make a choice: fight or flee.\nIl-mok pondered.\n'We're one person short, but... the test still has about two hours left....'\nFight now and be done with it? Or run around for another hour?\nThe deliberation was brief, and Il-mok made his decision.\nClang.\nFeeling annoyed, Il-mok decided to fight.\nAnd soon, as their faces became clearly visible through the underbrush, Il-mok realized he had forgotten one important fact.\n\"Young Master Il-mok!\" Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on n͟o͟v͟e͟l͟f͟i͟r͟e͟.net\nThe moment a woman at the front of the group called out his name…\nIl-mok froze like a man cursed by Medusa herself.",

I have no choice but to look straight at her face when fighting.’\nThe moment Il-mok made direct eye contact with Bang Mi-hwa, his obsessive-compulsive symptoms began flaring up.\nAnd while Il-mok hesitated...\nBang Mi-hwa and her team members, who had approached nearby, boldly charged at Il-mok's teammates.\nAs expected, Bang Mi-hwa charged towards Il-mok, but she wasn't alone.\n‘Still, just in case, wouldn’t it be better to have at least one more person provide support?’\nIt was because Mi-hwa had accepted Ha Young's advice.\nUltimately, Il-mok found himself facing Bang Mi-hwa and one Lower Class disciple.\n\"Urgh! These annoying bastards!!\"\nHa Young and another disciple from the Lower Class charged at Choi Woong.\nLastly, Ju Seo-yeon, the weakest of the group, faced a disciple from a different group.\nIf there was any silver lining...\nSwoooosh!\n…it was that Jeong Hyeon, having positioned earlier, provided long-range support for his teammates.\nHowever, that merely prevented the worst-case scenario.\nThey were barely holding on, thanks to Jeong Hyeon's covering fire.\nIl-mok, in particular, was on the verge of losing his mind.\n—Now's the time!\n—We're fighting because of the test anyway, right?\n—Just carve her face as you desired!\n—Balance out the left and right sides! She’ll probably be happy about it too!\nThe other persona burgeoning within his mind relentlessly tempted him to use his sword on Bang Mi-hwa's face. Only the last vestiges of his sanity, recognizing the flawed logic of those inner voices, held him back.\n'Test or not, the moment I put my sword to her face, it's over!!'\nSubduing opponents without inflicting serious injuries was a prerequisite for combat in this test. A major facial reconstruction surgery would be a blatant violation of that rule.\n\"Urgh.\"\nIl-mok unconsciously swung his sword, almost slashing Bang Mi-hwa's face, but managed to stop his arm at the last moment.\n\"Hmph.\"\nMisinterpreting his restraint as affection, Bang Mi-hwa smirked and swung her fan.\n'For fuck sake. Let’s at least avoid eye contact for now.’\nIl-mok had no choice but to awkwardly avert his gaze while fighting.\nHe tried to focus only on Bang Mi-hwa's body and weapon, making an effort not to look at her face.\nThanks to that, he managed to hold out, but the basics of fighting involve reading the opponent's movements.\nClang!\n\"Tsk.\"\nNot being able to read her eyes was a major handicap in many ways, and above all...\n\"Damn it.\"\nHis forced attempts to avoid Bang Mi-hwa's face made his movements awkward and clumsy.\nMeanwhile...\nUnlike Choi Woong or Il-mok, Ju Seo-yeon, who ended up in a one-on-one match with a single Martial Arts Disciple, was in a somewhat less dire situation.\nObviously, just because she had trained like a madman for twenty days doesn’t mean that her skill had caught up with the rest of her classmates.\nHer opponent was from the Upper Class, while she had barely passed the entrance exam for the Hall of the Demonic Way to begin with.\nFurthermore, even if she had trained her hardest for twenty days, her opponent hadn't been idle either.\nSo...\nSwoooosh!\nShe was only managing to hold on thanks to Jeong Hyeon's perfectly timed arrows.\nAlso, test rules, which prevented the use of dangerous techniques, also played a role.\nThanks to these two factors, Seo-yeon, who had some breathing room, could quickly realize...\n...that the current situation was dangerous.\n'If we all get subdued like this, I can't achieve the second rank!'\nFrankly speaking, if she managed to defeat her opponent with Jeong Hyeon’s help, it would be meaningless if Choi Woong or Il-mok were defeated in the meantime.\nTheir martial prowess was much greater than hers. Especially the young master, who was considered unmatched in his abilities.\nBut why was this unmatched figure struggling against just two attackers?\nAs Ju Seo-yeon's thoughts reached this point, a memory she had completely forgotten suddenly surfaced.\n—He's already in love with me, so you'll only end up hurt, Disciple Ju.\nLooking at the current situation, the nonsense that Bang Mi-hwa had gone out of her way to tell her in the past doesn’t seem like nonsense after all.\n‘So the Young Master’s preferences leaned that way.’\nSuch a thought naturally crossed her mind, but that wasn't what was important right now.\nJu Seo-yeon, believing that the young master couldn't attack Bang Mi-hwa because of the emotion called love, made a bold decision.\nFor her goal of becoming the second-ranked disciple within two years, for a rosy future with Jin Hayeon!\nClang!\nWhile her opponent was momentarily distracted after blocking an incoming arrow...\nInstead of swinging her spear to attack the enemy, Ju Seo-yeon...\nWhoosh!\nSuddenly, she launched her body and rushed toward where Il-mok was fighting.\n\"What!?\"\nStartled, the confused enemy quickly launched himself and chased after Ju Seo-yeon. He hurriedly swung his sword at her, but it was a bit too late.\nJu Seo-yeon, having launched a surprise dash, threw her entire body directly at Bang Mi-hwa.\n\"!?\"\nCaught off guard by the unexpected attack, Bang Mi-hwa, who was about to swing her fan, had to quickly change its trajectory as her opponent threw herself defenseless.\nThis was because she was supposed to just subdue, not kill or seriously injure.\nAnd in that brief moment when Bang Mi-hwa hesitated, Ju Seo-yeon covered Bang Mi-hwa's face with her entire body...\n'Now!'\nFreed from the petrifying gaze, Il-mok's sword moved decisively.\nThe sword lurched like a snake, curving around Ju Seo-yeon’s body and precisely striking Bang Mi-hwa at the paralyzing acupoint.\n\"Urgh.\"\nIn that moment when Bang Mi-hwa's body stiffened from having her acupoint struck...\nThud.\nJu Seo-yeon, who had launched herself, tackled her, and the two of them rolled on the ground together.\nJu Seo-yeon, having also been struck in her paralyzing point by her pursuer mid-lunge, had no leeway to execute a breakfall.\nBut even while having her acupoint struck, Ju Seo-yeon didn't stop talking.\n“I’ll hold her down, Young Master!!”\nAnd Il-mok, now completely freed from the binding, wore a chilling expression.\n\"Ah, ah. It's been a while. This feeling.\"\nIl-mok's Qi Deviation, triggered by Bang Mi-hwa, had begun.\nHe didn't exactly massacre the enemies into a thousand pieces.\nHis obsession had simply transferred to his swordsmanship.\nIl-mok's sword moved, drawing a perfect path that would naturally elicit the word beautiful.\n\"Urgh...\"\nThe disciple who had been double-teaming Il-mok with Bang Mi-hwa was neutralized in a single strike, struck on his paralyzing acupoint.\n\"...Damn it.\"\nThe disciple who had hurriedly chased and subdued Ju Seo-yeon quickly realized something was going wrong and cursed.\nPrick\nBut just as he was about to retreat, Il-mok’s sword, as fast as lightning, had already struck his acupoint.\nHaving subdued two more in an instant, Il-mok moved with uncharacteristic haste. Not to help Choi Woong, who was facing a combined attack…\nSwoosh!\n…but simply because only by swinging his sword could he expel the reflux of this maddening compulsion.\n\"Urgh...\"\nCaught off guard by Il-mok's sudden intervention, Ha Young and the other disciple attacking Choi Woong couldn't hold out for long before having their pressure points struck as well.\nJu Seo-yeon, who was watching the fight while lying on top of Bang Mi-hwa, exclaimed in an admiring tone.\n\"As expected of you, young master!\"\nEven while lying down with her acupoint struck, she couldn't keep her mouth shut.\n\"Huff. Huff.\"\nChoi Woong, who had been under attack until just now, caught his breath and thought.\n'To think we tried to catch someone like this with just three people. I must have been crazy.'\nIt was a moment when he freshly realized how foolish his past self had been.\nThen, Jeong Hyeon, who had retreated far away to provide support from the start, belatedly pushed through the bushes and returned.\n\"Young... master?\"\nStopping ten feet away, Jeong Hyeon called out to Il-mok, who, for some reason, was still gripping his sword and trembling slightly.\nInstead of answering the question, Il-mok uttered something completely unexpected.\n“Do not approach me.”\nWith those words, Il-mok suddenly began performing a sword dance.\n—Still not enough.\n—To make that woman's face symmetrical, I need more precise swordsmanship.\nIt was a rehearsal for Bang Mi-hwa's plastic surgery, but...\n\".......\"\nFaced with that beautiful sword dance, which far surpassed their level, Choi Woong and Jeong Hyeon could only stare in awe.\n\"Young master! Now that it's over, could you release my acupoint!?\"\n\"Eek! Get off me quickly!\"\nOnly the desperate cries of the oblivious Ju Seo-yeon and the pinned Bang Mi-hwa echoed in the air.\nThe day after the test ended.\nAlthough everyone was engrossed in martial arts training as usual, there was a somewhat peculiar atmosphere in the hall.\nUnlike usual, the martial arts training was being conducted under the supervision of an assistant instructor instead of Instructor Chu Il-hwan, and one by one, disciples were being summoned by the assistant instructor to visit a certain pavilion.\nAnd Instructor Chu Il-hwan was in that very pavilion.\nHe was conducting individual interviews to discuss the results of yesterday's test.\n\"Disciple Il-mok, please enter.\"\nAt the assistant instructor's summons, Il-mok's face darkened.\nIt wasn't because the strategy of hiding his abilities had gone down the drain due to yesterday's test.\n'To think I have to be alone in a room with that lecherous instructor!'\nThe mere thought of it made his skin crawl, and now it was about to become reality.\nIl-mok entered the pavilion feeling like he was being dragged to a slaughterhouse.\n\"Welcome.\"\n\"Yes, Instructor.\"\nLike Jeong Hyeon, Il-mok maintained a distance of three meters from Chu Il-hwan as he greeted him.\n\"Please take a seat.\"\n\"I prefer to stand, Instructor.\"\n\"???\"\nChu Il-hwan stared at him with a bewildered look for a moment.\nThen, shrugging as if it didn't matter, he asked with a playful smile.\n“I saw your sword dance at the end of the test.”\n“Ha… Hahaha. I-I suddenly had an enlightenment during the fight.”\nIl-mok tried to laugh it off.\nHe didn't want to be exposed for hiding his skills, and more importantly...\n'I can't exactly say it was a rehearsal for plastic surgery!'\nIt was a complicated story in many ways.\nChu Il-hwan, mistaking Il-mok's answer as a lie, smiled slyly. This update ıs available on NoveI-Fire.ɴet\n\"Enlightenment... you mean your skills suddenly improved.\"\n\"Th-that's right. Hahaha.\"\n\"Haha. If that's what you say, well, I guess that's what it is.\"\nChu Il-hwan narrowed his eyes, a mischievous glint appearing in them as if he had thought of something amusing.\n“By the way, I heard a rumor that you and Disciple Bang Mi-hwa are quite close.”\nHaving observed Il-mok’s group throughout the test, he hadn't missed their final battle. He had seen Il-mok’s initial hesitation to attack Bang Mi-hwa.\nNormally, he would have dismissed it as just a baseless rumor, but having seen it with his own eyes, he couldn't help but be suspicious.\nOf course, the Hall of the Demonic Way didn't particularly care whether the disciples were in relationships or not; he was simply feeling playful.\nAnd Il-mok, who was about to deny the absurd nonsense from Instructor Chu Il-hwan, realized something important.\n‘Why would that lecherous instructor ask such a question? Don't tell me!?’\nQuickly composing his expression, Il-mok replied in a solemn tone.\n\"I can't speak carelessly as someone might get hurt. But let me make one thing clear. I like… women , Instructor.”\n\"???\"\nChu Il-hwan looked at Il-mok with an expression that seemed to question what kind of bullshit he was suddenly spouting.",

    "content": "Chapter 71: The First Test (6)\nSeeing the bizarre expression on Instructor Chu Il-hwan's usually playful face, I became certain.\n'Damn it. So he really did have ulterior motives.'\nI was glad I’d made it explicitly clear this time that I’m not interested in men.\nOnce he’d composed himself, Chu Il‑hwan cleared his throat and said, “Ahem. Anyway, congratulations on gaining enlightenment and improving your skills. I can’t wait to see you become one of the leading figures of the cult after you graduate from this place.”\nSeeing his eagerness to conclude the interview, I bowed and quickly exited the pavilion.\n‘He must be stung by the rejection.’\nJust because someone leans that way doesn't necessarily mean they're a bad person.\nNo, most likely, the majority aren't.\nHowever, that guy was a psychopath who practiced a Demonic Art. If I let my guard down for even a moment, there was no telling what kind of horrific things might happen.\nAfter Il-mok left, Instructor Chu Il-hwan pondered.\nWhen asked about his relationship with Bang Mi-hwa, he replied that he liked women. Putting together Il-mok’s recent behavior and the rumors circulating…\n‘So he’s saying one Bang Mi-hwa isn’t enough to satisfy him.’\nAs expected of someone so talented, his desire matched his skills.\nHe'd been surprised by the sudden confession initially, but honestly, Instructor Chu Il-hwan didn't dwell on that part too much.\nThe Heavenly Demon Divine Cult didn't prohibit polygamy. They prioritized martial prowess and punishing evil, so as long as no one was forced into a relationship and training wasn't neglected for the sake of pleasure, it wasn't a concern.\n‘Truly an interesting young master.’\nInstructor Chu Il-hwan, who had been snickering, quickly returned to his usual smiling expression when he heard the door open and greeted the next disciple.\n\"Welcome. Disciple Dokgo.\"\n\"Greetings, Instructor.\"\nDespite his generally self-centered behavior, Dokgo Pae showed proper respect to the instructor. Follow current novels on novęlfire.net\n'Hmm.'\nChu Il‑hwan watched him sit without being prompted and thought, ‘Second in rank and the eldest grandson of the Dokgo Family. Normally, he would be considered the top talent of the year, such a shame that he falls somewhat short compared to the Eighth Young Master.’\nHe decided to probe a bit.\n\"What did you think of this test, Disciple Dokgo?\"\n\"I was disappointed.\"\n\"Oh? In what way?\"\nExpecting some self-criticism, Chu Il-hwan was met instead with a baffling answer.\n“Because we weren’t allowed to wound each other, I couldn’t fight properly and was easily defeated. If it had been a fight to the death, things would have been different, Instructor!\"\nHearing that bold and confident answer, Chu Il-hwan couldn’t help but smile.\n‘I’d like to kill him too, but for different reasons.’\nThe side effect of the Black Thunder Demonic Palm crawled up his right hand. But he shut the murderous impulse down and forced a smile.\n“I see. Since you think that way, I won’t question your martial skill further. I’ll ask about the other aspects. What do you think about the other aspects of this test?”\n\"Other aspects, sir?\"\nSeeing Dokgo Pae's confusion, Chu Il-hwan elaborated.\n\"By now, you must understand that this test wasn't simply about competing in martial arts skills, right?\"\n\"Isn't it enough for a martial artist to excel in martial arts?\"\n“After graduating from the Demonic Academy, you’ll be assigned to a unit. This training and test are designed to cultivate your ability to carry out the cult’s orders. Martial prowess isn't the end-all be-all in your missions.”\nOnly then did Dokgo Pae nod in understanding.\n“I see what you mean, but it doesn't apply to me.\"\nThe moment he heard that stupid remark, Chu Il-hwan felt like the black dragon slumbering in his right hand might go berserk.\nExercising his patience to the limit, Chu Il-hwan forced himself to hear Dokgo Pae’s explanation.\n\"As the eldest grandson of the Dokgo Family, I’m destined to lead one day. I believe my role is to crush enemies with overwhelming force and leave such trivial matters to others. Ah, come to think of it, during this exam I did find a disciple particularly skilled in those fields. It wouldn't be bad to continue working with that disciple in the future.\"\nOnly then was Chu Il-hwan able to calm down the black dragon slumbering in his right hand.\n‘Phew. So, his head isn't entirely for decoration.’\nAfter organizing his thoughts, Chu Il-hwan spoke quickly like firing an arrow.\n“Good. Recognizing and utilizing your comrade’s strengths and weaknesses is equally important, especially as you rise higher, that ability will become even more necessary.\"\n\"I'll be mindful, Instructor.\"\n\"Think more about this issue in the future, and you may go now.\"\nNormally, he would have given more detailed criticism, but Instructor Chu Il-hwan quickly dismissed Dokgo Pae.\nHe feared he might actually kill him if their conversation continued.\nMeanwhile, around the same time.\nJust as Instructor Chu Il-hwan was conducting interviews for the Upper Class, Instructor Eun Ryeo was also conducting interviews for the Lower Class.\n\"Disciple Ju Seo-yeon.\"\nIn response to the typically prickly and cold-looking Instructor Eun Ryeo's call, Ju Seo-yeon answered with her usual bright face.\n\"Yes, Instructor.\"\n“Hmm. I’ve heard you’ve improved greatly since enrollment. Was there a reason for this change?”\n\"It's all thanks to Young Master Il-mok!\"\n“…Have you forgotten that within the Hall, all disciples are equals? Using ‘Young Master’ may create an awkward atmosphere.”\n\"I'll be more careful, Instructor!\"\nYet, her smile never wavered despite her response.\nInstructor Eun Ryeo sighed softly and spoke in her usual curt tone.\n“Still, I’m relieved to see you’re clearly on your way to improving yourself. Of course, you’re still a bit lacking in every area, but if you keep training like this, I believe you will catch up to your peers by the time you graduate from the Hall.”\n\"Instructor. Just catching up isn't enough! I must graduate as the second-ranked disciple!\"\n\"Se-second...?\"\nFor the first time, Instructor Eun Ryeo's icy composure cracked as she looked at Ju Seo-yeon with disbelief.\n\"Yes, Instructor! I must graduate second so I can be with him!\"\n\"......\"\nInstructor Eun Ryeo began to spin. Who was this 'him' she was referring to?\n'Could she be talking about the Eighth Young Master?'\nSuddenly, everything clicked into place. No wonder Ju Seoyeon’s performance has shot up lately.\n‘She’d been trying to win his favor all along.’\nHaving more or less grasped the situation, Instructor Eun Ryeo quickly resumed her usual curt expression and dismissed her.\n“Very well. Keep working hard as you have been.\"\n\"Yes, Instructor!\"\nJu Seo-yeon left the place with confidence in her steps.\n\"Whew.\"\nInstructor Eun Ryeo let out a deep sigh and rubbed her weary face.\nHearing the arrival of the next disciple shortly after, Instructor Eun Ryeo spoke with her usual tone, \"Come in.\"\nAt her command, the door slowly opened and a timid disciple cautiously entered.\n\"Take a seat.\"\n\"I, I, I pre-prefer to st-stand, In-Instructor.\"\nSeeing Disciple Jeong Hyeon trying to maintain a distance of about ten feet, Instructor Eun Ryeo barely held back a sigh and maintained her cold expression.\n\"If that's more comfortable for you, then stand and listen.\"\n\"Ye-yes, Instructor.\"\nHowever, contrary to her frosty expression, the content that came out of Instructor Eun Ryeo's mouth was full of praise.\nShe commended his long-range support during battles, his hunting skills in procuring food, and his excellent tracking abilities.\nAfter recounting Jeong Hyeon's achievements during this test, Instructor Eun Ryeo concluded her praise by saying, \"As far as this test goes, it means that Disciple Jeong ranked at least among the top five in terms of contributions.\"\nIn response to Instructor Eun Ryeo's consecutive praises, Jeong Hyeon, who had shrunk his entire body, answered in a small voice with a completely reddened face.\n\"I-it's all tha-thanks to Yo-Young Master Il-Il-mok.\"\nInstructor Eun Ryeo felt a sense of déjà vu.\n'Even though your manner and attitude are different, you're giving exactly the same answer as Disciple Ju Seo-yeon.'\nInstructor Eun Ryeo thought that Il-mok somehow seemed destined to become a man with many sins.\nFor some reason, she gave Jeong Hyeon a different response than she had given Ju Seo-yeon.\n\"While Disciple Il-mok's leadership was excellent, it was your ability that perfectly carried out your mission, wasn't it?\"\nInstructor Eun Ryeo hoped that Jeong Hyeon wouldn't rely too excessively on Il-mok. Unlike Ju Seo-yeon, he seemed like he would crumble easily if Il-mok hurt him.\n\"Also, there's no guarantee that you'll be in the same team as Disciple Il-mok in every future test. Disciple Il-mok led you well because he knows you well, but others won’t. So, from now on, you need to learn to communicate your strengths to your teammates.”\nJeong Hyeon’s face, which had been flushed red, instantly turned deathly pale.\nThe thought of being paired with strangers and having to explain his abilities to them took his breath away.\nSeeing the formerly rosy-cheeked Jeong Hyeon turned pale, Instructor Eun Ryeo sighed softly and gently said, \"Would you like to take off your bandages for a moment? You seem uncomfortable.”\nDespite the offer, Jeong Hyeon gently shook her head.\n\"I-I'm fine, Instructor. I-I'm used to it.\"\nAs she said this, Jeong Hyeon gently placed a hand on her chest, feeling the tightly wound bandages underneath her clothes, wrapped that way so they wouldn’t interfere with her archery. She also self-consciously touched her short hair, which had been cut for the same reason, and avoided Instructor Eun Ryeo's eyes.\nSeeing her anxious appearance, barely managed to hold back another sigh.\n“Go outside and take a moment to breathe where no one can see you.”\n\"Th-thank you, Instructor!\"\nWatching Jeong Hyeon’s retreating back after her quick salute, Instructor Eun Ryeo finally let out the sigh she had been holding back.\nIt wasn't a sigh of contempt. It was a sigh filled with pity.\n\"Haah.\"\nHer expression completely softening, Instructor Eun Ryeo relaxed her tense facial muscles and thought, ‘How should I help that child?’\nStartled by her own thoughts, she quickly shook her head.\nThe side effect of the Demonic Art that Instructor Eun Ryeo had learned was excessive compassion and an inability to refuse.\nIt was hard for her to bear seeing pitiful people or those who needed her help.\nHer constant cold demeanor and blunt speech were a defense mechanism to avoid this very situation. More precisely, to avoid being targeted by those who would feign helplessness to exploit her.\nWhen she used a cold face and a curt tone, the people often got intimidated and gave up asking for a favor. It was a kind of life hack.\nOf course, while it was a side effect somewhat suitable for an instructor's position, which required taking care of young disciples, carelessly revealing such a side effect was dangerous.\nThe role of an instructor was to care for and teach all disciples, rather than focusing all attention on just one or two.\nMoreover, if she was swayed by the side effect and succumbed to her excessive sympathy, there was a risk she wouldn't even be able to properly handle her basic duties.\n“Phew. That was close.”\nThinking of Jeong Hyeon, who especially stimulated her sympathy, Eun Ryeo breathed out a sigh of relief.\nShe was certain that if Jeong Hyeon were to cry and tearfully plead for her help, she absolutely wouldn't be able to refuse.\n\"Ah!\"\nInstructor Eun Ryeo, who had barely gathered her composure, belatedly realized an important fact and made a regretful expression.\n\"I forgot about that.\"\nIt was something that needed to be shared with others as well, but it was especially important to inform Jeong Hyeon, and she had failed to convey it.\n(TL Note: Well, as you can see, the cat is out of the bag, at least to us readers. From the beginning, the author didn’t use a masculine pronoun for Jeong Hyeon. He uses either ‘that person’ or just plainly and directly writes her name when it's from Il-mok's perspective. I’ll use ‘he/him’ on her until Il-mok finds out.)",

    "content": "Chapter 72: Seniors (1)\nThat evening, after dinner, I crossed the massive central training ground as usual, heading to the secluded place where Jeong Hyeon would be waiting.\nCreeeaaak.\nWith an unpleasant grating sound, the main gate of the Hall of the Demonic Way was opened.\nUnder the crimson sky painted by the setting sun, I saw a group of just over twenty people cloaked in billowing cloaks briskly entering the Hall of the Demonic Way grounds.\n‘Hmm. Come to think of it, there was talk about that.’\nI recalled what Instructor Chu Il-hwan had announced after all the interviews had concluded today.\nIt was news that the second-year disciples of the Hall of the Demonic Way were returning.\nThe program at the Hall lasted two years. While the first year focused on various basic training, the core of the second year was practical experience.\nThey would periodically leave the Hall and join martial units or other organizations to perform missions together for about two weeks to a month.\nIn other words, the seniors who had left for their first practical experience around the time I entered the hall were just now returning.\nI briefly observed the seniors, wrapped in their cloaks, crossing the training ground,\nI observed the seniors briefly as they crossed the training ground wrapped in flowing cloaks, exuding a solemn atmosphere.\n'Well, it’s none of my business.'\nI turned away and headed towards the spot where we practiced stealth techniques.\nWhen I arrived, I saw Jeong Hyeon already there, bow drawn and aimed at the empty air.\n“Here again today, I see.”\nI deliberately kept a distance of about ten feet to accommodate him as I greeted him. Jeong Hyeon quickly turned around and deeply bowed his head.\n\"I-it's been a while, Young Master!\"\n“…Didn’t we fight together just yesterday?”\n\"It, it just somehow f-felt like a long time, Young Master.\"\n\"I, I see.\"\nI stepped back another pace when I saw how nervous he was.\n“Hic!”\nSuddenly, Jeong Hyeon made a brave expression and boldly took a step forward.\nAnd since the distance narrowed again, he became restless again.\n‘Did his social anxiety get worse? Why did he brave himself on stepping closer?’\nI wondered if he had gone even more unstable due to higher achievements in his Demonic Art.\nHe looked like he might succumb to Qi Deviation if left alone, so I tried to distract him.\n\"Ah. Come to think of it, didn't you have an interview today?\"\n\"Yes. Yes! I, I had an interview w-with Instructor Eun Ryeo.\"\n\"I see. What did she say about the test?\"\nJeong Hyeon’s cheeks flamed as he squirmed in place.\n\"Sh-she said I did w-well.\"\nHe was clearly embarrassed about receiving praise from Instructor Eun Ryeo.\n\"A-and....\"\nJeong Hyeon tried to say something more, but suddenly his face turned pale white.\nThen it’s flushed to red before returning to white again.\nIt was quite a spectacle, to be honest.\n‘He’s going to lose it at this rate.’\nAnd my prediction was accurate.\nMy hunch proved right. Jeong Hyeon snapped his head up, stared at me with fierce determination, and blurted out, “Please stay by my side, Young Master!”\n\"???\"\nHis declaration left me speechless. Before I could process it—\n\"Tsk. Flirting in the sacred Hall, what a waste of time.” Orıginal content can be found at novel-fire.net\nAn unexpected troublemaker emerged from behind.\nI turned around to see who it was and saw a man wearing a flowing cloak.\nJudging by his attire, he seemed to be one of those senior disciples who had just returned to the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nThe man with a square jaw and a sturdy build said as I met his gaze, “I came here to reflect on the insights I gained during my expedition, only to find you juniors engaging in such frivolous activity in my training spot. Get lost.”\nI couldn't help but laugh.\n'What's with this madman? Pick a lane, will you?'\nHe seemed open‑minded enough to tolerate two guys together and mistaking them for a couple, yet he spoke like a total old fogey.\nSetting aside my annoyance, I looked at the side.\n\"Eek!\"\nJeong Hyeon, whose face had been pale white until just now, was turning red again and continued until his face turned an alarming purple.\n‘He must be startled by the stranger.’\nAfter pondering briefly what to do, I clicked my tongue lightly and addressed the senior guy.\n“Tch. We were here first. If you want to practice that badly, go elsewhere.”\nThe senior burst into a manic laugh.\n“Bwahahaha! You junior has no respect! Fine! Let’s settle this the cult’s way.”\nI couldn't help but sigh.\n'Why do all these crazy fuckers think exactly the same way?'\nStill, I had roughly expected things to turn out this way. Stretching out my left hand, I beckon him.\n“Come at me.”\nA sinister smile spread across the senior's face at my provocation.\n“Alright! Let’s see if you can last until I sort out my enlightenment!!”\nWith that, he charged straight at me, utilizing his lightness skill.\nBut as straightforward as it was, his speed was explosive.\nThe moment I was within his striking range—\nSwiiiiish!\n—he drew his saber from the scabbard at his waist, demonstrating a fierce drawing technique.\nSince he was faster than I could retreat, I sidestepped to the left instead while utilizing my lightness skill.\nHis drawn blade flew towards me, but—\nClang!\nBy then, I had already propelled my body to the left and drawn my sword using the power of the Soul-Departing Sword.\nSwoosh.\nAdding the finesse of the Soul-Guiding Sword to deflect the force, I tried to flick the boar senior's saber upwards, but…\n'Oh?'\nHe was a year my senior for a reason; his saber didn’t give way as easily as Dokgo Pae’s sword.\nThe boar continued to swing his saber relentlessly, trying to corner me.\n‘Is he the same type as that assistant instructor?’\nHis saber style reminded me of Chu Il-hwan's assistant. It primarily consisted of offense-oriented fast saber techniques. Moreover, it was evident he hadn't just been playing around during his year at the Hall of the Demonic Way. The way he connected his techniques with others was quite natural.\nHe was definitely several levels above that Dokgo fellow.\nHowever, being still just a disciple, he fell short compared to an instructor.\n'In that case.'\nAfter retreating and dodging several times using footwork, I gradually became accustomed to his fighting style and switched tactics.\n‘Let's end this quickly with a head-on clash.’\nUtilizing the Soul-Cutting Flash, which emphasizes the essence of speed, I unleashed consecutive thrusts.\nThe rapidly moving sword and saber each created silver trajectories in the air.\nClang! Clang!\nSparks flew as our weapons clashed repeatedly.\nAfter several rapid collisions of sword and saber, it was my side that was gradually being pushed back.\nThe boar's saber technique wasn't just fast; it also carried tremendous power, making my hands numb with each collision.\n\"Haaah!\"\nSeizing an opportunity, he roared and swung his blade with all his might once more—\nSwish.\nI swung my sword as if to collide with him using the Soul-Cutting Flash. Then, the sword, flying in a straight line, changed its path midway like a snake, slid past the boar’s saber and shot straight towards his throat.\nSwish.\n\"It's over.\"\nUsing a feint at the last moment, I stopped my sword just right before his Adam’s apple.\nI had narrowly dodged his final strike by twisting my body.\nIt was a necessary, risky move that I made to end the fight quickly. My risky gamble to end the fight quickly had paid off.\nI was confident I could win even with a more confrontational approach, but the reason I chose such a risky move was due to the aftermath of the previous test.\n‘Whew. Good thing I finished before the compulsion kicked in.’\nAll thanks to the previous incident with Bang Mi-hwa.\nFortunately, I had only performed the sword dance using the first fourteen forms of my Demonic Art back then. Thanks to that, my realm didn’t skyrocket and the side effect didn’t worsen.\nI was able to calm my obsession down and end the sword dance quickly.\nBut sparring too long with a senior of this caliber risked unleashing another unwanted enlightenment.\nThe boar, who was helplessly subdued by the last move, looked down at the sword pointed at his neck with a half-dazed expression.\n\"Ah!\"\nAs if coming to a realization, he suddenly exclaimed in admiration and burst into laughter.\n“Bwahahaha! I was completely outplayed by a junior! To think you’d use that method to create a feint!”\nIt seemed he had mentally replayed the duel process in that short time.\nOf course, I didn't care.\n“Well then, please leave now, Senior.”\n“Kehahaha! Right. The losers should keep their mouths shut. If you say leave, I must leave. But before I go, I must say this.”\nHe was indeed a contradictory human.\nSince he knows that he is the loser, he should just shut his mouth.\nOblivious to my thoughts, the boar-like senior just kept blabbering.\n\"I apologize for the misunderstanding. With skills like yours, Junior, you can date all you want. Hahaha! Have a good time!\"\nBefore Jeong Hyeon or I could respond, he wheeled around and strode off, cloak billowing behind him.\n'What a madman.'\nThen again, in the Demonic Cult, \"crazy\" was just another word for \"normal.\"\n‘Don't think too much about it. It'll trigger my obsession.’\nShaking off the stray thoughts, I turned around and saw Jeong Hyeon’s ashen face.\nWatching the senior’s retreating back, who arrived like the wind and left like the wind.\n\"Are you okay?\"\nAt Il-mok's question, Jeong Hyeon hiccupped with a pale face.\n\"Hic!\"\nThanks to the senior’s rambling, she realized that what she had said earlier could be easily misinterpreted.\n‘I-I just meant f-for us to continue being in the same group…’\nAfter receiving Instructor Eun Ryeo’s advice, Jeong Hyeon spent the entire day contemplating what she would do if he and Il-mok were separated for the next test.\nThe mere thought made her feel suffocated and terrified.\nThat's why she had asked Il-mok to be by her side.\nShe couldn’t bear the thought of being in a group with anyone else.\n‘I-I need to explain…’\nIf he misunderstood that she had confessed to him, she needed to clear up the misunderstanding quickly.\nIf Il-mok had mistaken her words for a confession, she needed to clear up the misunderstanding immediately. Otherwise, he might lose the first friend she had made since learning the Ghost Spirit Divine Bow.\nHowever, the pressure made it even harder for her to speak.\nWhile Jeong Hyeon was fidgeting, not knowing what to do.\nIl-mok, who had been watching her for a moment, scratched his head and said, “About what you said just now.”\n“N-No, that’s not it. W-What I meant w-was…”\n“You meant you wanted to stay in the same group, right?”\n\"!?\"\nJeong Hyeon’s eyes widened in surprise. How did he know?\n\"Y-yes. That's what I meant, Young Master.\"\nAt her answer, Il-mok nodded once and said with an awkward expression, “Assigning the group was up to the instructors' whims, so I can’t give you a definite answer. But still, I’ll try talking to the instructors about it.”\n\"Th-thank you, Young Master!\"\nThe glue that had been sealing to her mouth seemed to have peeled off, and now words came out comfortably for Jeong Hyeon.\nThe suffocating tightness in her chest and the overwhelming rush of blood that made her head dizzy vanished instantly.\nBut why is it?\nDespite feeling relieved, Jeong Hyeon felt an inexplicable sense of regret in one corner of her heart.",

    "content": "Chapter 73: Seniors (2)\nAround the time Il-mok and Jeong Hyeon cleared up their misunderstanding…\nSwish.\nSomeone carefully moved away from that place.\n\"Phew.\"\nOnly after reaching a spot where neither Il-mok nor Jeong Hyeon could hear her did Instructor Eun Ryeo, dressed in tight black stealth clothes and moving through the shadows, finally exhale deeply.\n‘I'm glad that worked out.’\nIn truth, what she had forgotten to tell Jeong Hyeon was precisely about the senior they had just encountered.\nThat secluded training ground where they practiced stealth techniques daily was actually a training spot frequently used by their Upper Class senior disciple named Mak Ho-yeol.\nWhile it was trivial information for most, to Jeong Hyeon, it was vital.\nGiven her social anxiety, having a senior suddenly burst in on her would be nothing short of terrifying.\nOf course, Eun Ryeo hadn't initially planned to sneak around in nightclothes like this.\n“Yes… It’s time for that child to grow up a little.”\nShe had resolved that, since she’d already missed her chance to warn her, she would let it go.\nAlthough she hadn't told them about Disciple Mak Ho-yeol, she had gathered all the disciples today and informed them that the senior disciples were returning.\nYet the more she tried to brush it off, the more her body grew restless with concern until she couldn't bear it any longer.\nThat's why she had ended up coming here secretly.\nIn the end, it was all for nothing, as Il-mok had handled the situation himself without her intervention.\nYet, even though the situation was resolved, Instructor Eun Ryeo's expression wasn't entirely at ease.\nIt wasn’t that she regretted not intervening in the unsanctioned duel.\nIl-mok had stepped in to help Jeong Hyeon after all.\nDespite her indifferent facade, Instructor Eun Ryeo had enough flexibility to understand that. If for nothing else, then for poor Jeong Hyeon's sake.\nThe problem was something else entirely.\n'Sigh. Indeed, Disciple Il-mok is growing up to be a man with many sins.'\nThat poor girl had summoned all her courage to confess her feelings, only for Il-mok to brush her off with that vague excuse.\nWatching this scene brimming with the bittersweet flavor of youthful yearning, the unmarried Instructor Eun Ryeo almost found herself in tears out of sympathy for Jeong Hyeon.\nMeanwhile.\nHaving lost to Il-mok and shooed from the training ground, Mak Ho-yeol headed straight for the senior year dormitory, the Black Tiger Pavilion.\n“Hmm? Didn’t you say you were going to sort out your enlightenment?”\nA fellow second-year candidate asked with a puzzled look upon seeing Mak Ho-yeol return so quickly, which the latter laughed off heartily.\n“Hahaha! There was already someone there.”\n“Hmm? Someone at this hour? Must be a junior then.”\n“That's right. Hahaha. We ended up fighting over the spot, but I got thoroughly beaten by the junior. Huahahaha.”\nSeeing Mak Ho-yeol's seemingly unconcerned laughter, the other disciple was bewildered.\n'Ho-yeol lost?'\nIn terms of ranking within their batch, Mak Hoyeol was roughly mid-tier in the Upper Class. However, that was based on the Hall of the Demonic Way’s comprehensive evaluation which included various factors.\nHowever, this evaluation wasn’t entirely accurate, considering that he paid little attention to anything other than martial arts. Fresh chapters posted on NoveIꜰire.net\nBut if one were to rank him solely based on martial prowess alone, Mak Ho-yeol was amongst the top tier within their batch.\n“Did you let your guard down?”\n“Me? Caught off guard? Now that’s quite the accusation.”\nAs flames began to ignite in Mak Ho-yeol's eyes, who had been laughing foolishly until now, the disciple who asked the question laughed awkwardly and waved his hands.\n\"Just joking. Calm down.\"\nHaving been peers for a full year, they were all well aware of each other's personalities and characteristics. In the early months, they’d sparred in secret behind the instructors’ backs, but lately they’d learned to give each other space.\n“That you lost even while giving it your all… that’s surprising.”\n\"Hahaha. I was surprised too. But thanks to that junior, I was able to sort out my enlightenment, so it’s not a bad experience. Hahaha.”\nMak Ho-yeol laughed with his usual simple-mindedness, but his fellow disciple’s expression was complex.\nIt was understandable.\nA one-year gap might not seem like much, but in the Hall, it was substantial enough to be considered significant.\nThis was a gathering place for the most talented individuals in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, where they practiced a form of martial arts known as Demonic Arts.\nWhat is the greatest advantage of Demonic Arts?\nIt’s their incredibly fast rate of development.\nIt might be different for those who had reached their pinnacle, but for people at their age, that twelve-month gap is a chasm that normally wouldn’t be able to bridge.\nAs he pondered what kind of junior could have done this, a piece of information he had heard during a recent expedition surfaced in his mind.\n“Maybe that junior is the new youngest disciple the Heavenly Demon just took in.”\n\"The Heavenly Demon's youngest disciple?\"\nSeeing Mak Ho-yeol's expression of confusion, the disciple sighed as if he couldn't believe it.\n\"Didn't you hear what the seniors from the Red Dragon Corps said during this expedition? They said the Heavenly Demon's youngest disciple is rumored to be a genius. And that he was scheduled to enter the Hall of the Demonic Way with this batch.\"\n“Hmm. I think I might have heard something like that… or maybe not. I don't know. Hahaha!”\nThe sight of his ignorant classmate who thought of nothing but martial arts, made the disciple sigh again.\nJust then, one of the nearby disciples who’d overheard them stepped forward.\nThey had just returned from the expedition, so they were each taking time to get settled. Hearing the ongoing conversation, they couldn’t help but pause their actions.\nThe disciple who stepped forward, Baek Cheon, raised a question.\n\"I remember that story too, but something doesn't add up.\"\n\"Doesn't add up? What do you mean?\"\n\"Think about it. All the stories about the Eighth Young Master that the Red Dragon Corps seniors shared were about his wisdom. There wasn't any specific mention of his martial prowess, was there?\"\nThe others nodded in agreement..\nSome had heard the stories about the youngest disciple; others, like Mak Ho-yeol, had no recollection or simply didn’t care.\nAlthough rumors about Il-mok had spread widely throughout the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, these disciples were cut off from outside news during their practical training.\nThey entered the Hall of the Demonic Way around the same time the newly kidnapped Il-mok was forced to join the cult by the Heavenly Demon. And within the Hall, they had almost no means to exchange information with the outside world.\nAlthough the instructors and assistants occasionally visited the main headquarters, no one was frivolous enough to share every rumor or gossip with the disciples.\nIn other words, they hadn't received any information about Il-mok for a whole year, and only happened to hear about him during their recent practical training with the Red Dragon Corps.\nThe problem was that the Red Dragon Corps had also been away from headquarters for several months, so they hadn't heard about Il-mok entering the academy as the top scorer.\n“Establishing academies in each branch, creating the Pure Mind Hall to treat the side effects of Demonic Arts, advising the First Young Master on achieving Transcendence… Each of these stories is incredibly impressive, but do any of them involve martial prowess? And more importantly…”\nBaek Cheon paused briefly, enjoying the attention, then grinned.\n“The youngest disciple has only been in the cult for a year. Even if he is chosen by the Heavenly Demon, do you really think it’s possible for him to defeat Ho-yeol in just a year?”\nEveryone nearby nodded at the logic of his words.\nEven Park Gi-tae, who had initially suggested that the junior might be the youngest disciple, was now convinced otherwise.\nYet one question lingered.\n“Then who the hell is this junior?”\n\"Hmm. If we go by the rumors that circulated before we returned, the most outstanding among them has to be the heir of the Dokgo Family, right?”\nBaik Cheon nodded in agreement at that remark and asked Mak Ho-yeol, “The junior you fought, did he wield a sword?”\nMak Ho‑yeol nodded, though doubt clouded his face.\nHe did, but aren't the Dokgo Family's Nine Swords known for being an overbearing sword style? The junior I fought was a master who freely wielded both swift and flowing sword techniques.\"\nAs expected of a martial fanatic, while Mak Ho-yeol might not be interested in other news, he was quite knowledgeable about martial arts and skilled individuals.\nAs everyone reeled at his answer, Park Gi-tae spoke up, “We’ll never figure it out on our own, so how about calling a junior and asking him?”\n“You know one?”\n\"I know a fellow from before I joined the Hall. That guy should have been good enough to enter the Hall.\"\nA moment later, Park Gi‑tae returned with the junior he’d mentioned.\n“Junior Choi Woong greets the senior brothers.”\nChoi Woong bowed and gulped nervously.\nIt wasn't just one or two, but more than a dozen senior disciples were all staring at him. He’d never felt so nervous.\n\"Hahaha. We're not here to give you a hard time. Relax.”\nBaek Cheon said with a hearty laugh, trying to put Choi Woong at ease.\n“Oh, by the way, my name is Baek Cheon. You might have heard of me.”\n\"Yes, I've heard of you, senior.\"\n\"Hahaha. I'm glad you've heard of me.\"\nThough Baek Cheon laughed refreshingly, Choi Woong felt a chill run down his spine.\n'So this senior is that rascal from the Baek family.'\nBaek Cheon was a direct descendant of the Baek Family, one of the five major families known as the Demonic Cult’s Founding Families, along with Hyeokryeon, Ouyang, and Dokgo.\nUnlike Dokgo Pae, he wasn't the heir but the second among his siblings.\nAs Choi Woong recalled information about Baek Cheon internally, Baek Cheon grinned and asked, \"I just called you to ask one thing.\"\n\"Please ask, senior.\"\nChoi Woong snapped back to attention as Baek Cheon asked, “Tell me, who’s the strongest in your batch?”\nChoi Woong initially wondered why they were asking such an obvious question, but then he realized an important fact.\n‘Ah, they must be out of touch because they were at the academy.’\nAfter organizing his thoughts, Choi Woong answered, “It's Young Master Il-mok. I don't know if you've heard the news, but he is the youngest disciple newly chosen by the Heavenly Demon, Seniors.”\n\"!?\"\nAll the gathered senior disciples showed a surprised expression at Choi Woong's answer.\n“But… I heard the youngest disciple has only been in the cult for about a year…”\nEven Baek Cheon, who had appeared full of confidence, couldn't hide his surprise.\n“Ah! I see! The eldest grandson of the Dokgo Family must be more incompetent than I thought!”\nBaek Cheon, who had never held good feelings towards the Dokgo Family, blurted out whatever came to mind, but the reaction came from an unexpected place.\n“That sounds like you're saying I’m incompetent too.”\nThe one stepping forward with a crumpled face was Mak Ho-yeol. If the heir of the Dokgo Family was that incompetent to let a newbie in martial arts take the top seat of the first year, then Mak Ho-yeol who had lost to that newbie was nothing more than trash.\nRealizing his blunder, Baek Cheon tried to maintain his composure.\n'Tch. Fighting with that boar-like fellow would be such a hassle.\nBaek Cheon was the top student in their class. But that evaluation was based on the Hall’s criteria. On martial prowess, he was confident enough that he could ‘defeat’ Mak Ho-yeol. It was just that in the process, his dignity might be tarnished.\n'Tch. I was flustered by the unexpected news and spoke out of turn. What should I do about this?’\nApologizing to Mak Ho-yeol wasn’t a particularly good choice, as it would also damage his dignity,\nAs Baek Cheon pondered how to handle the situation, Choi Woong spoke up, saving him from the predicament.\n\"The Dokgo Pae is also outstanding among my peers. Honestly, even though we’re in the same class, I’m not confident I could beat him. However, Young Master Il-mok is… how should I put it…”\nAll eyes turned to Choi Woong, who paused to find the right word.\nChoi Woong, whose vocabulary wasn't particularly rich, couldn't think of a more suitable word and simply said what came to mind.\n“He’s not just a genius, he’s a monster.”\nOn the first day, when he saw him subdue Dokgo Pae, he thought he was indeed skilled enough to take the top spot.\nOn the second day, after picking a fight and getting thoroughly beaten, he realized they weren’t even in the same class.\nAnd yesterday, after observing Il-mok during the test, he had started to question something else entirely.\n\"Honestly, watching him… it makes you wonder if he’s even human, let alone someone who joined just a year ago.\"\nIt was beyond a difference in class; perhaps they were entirely different species.\nAfter Choi Woong's brief explanation about the Young Master ended…\n\".......\"\nA strange silence enveloped Black Tiger Pavilion.",

    "content": "Chapter 74: Seniors (3)\nThe silence didn’t last long.\n“...Even so, isn’t this a bit over the top?”\nWhile some couldn't believe Choi Woong's words...\n\"Hahaha! Well, well, I never imagined someone like that would exist!”\nMost of them were pleased.\nAfter all, Mak Ho-yeol, who was counted among the strongest in their class, had been defeated, so dismissing the story as fake is even more ridiculous than that.\nAnd the reason they were pleased was simple.\nTheir initial silence had merely been shock at the news. There was absolutely no reason for them to be displeased about a skilled junior joining their ranks.\nBecause...\n“By now, that youngest disciple must be holed up in Black Dragon Pavilion, right?”\n\"Let's go find him right away!\"\n\"Hahaha! A new sparring opponent, how exciting!\"\nThe Heavenly Demon Divine Cult revered martial strength. Except for the peculiar few who practiced Demonic Arts with strange side effects, most of these fanatics enjoyed fighting.\nThey were tired of fighting amongst themselves after a year of constant sparring, but a new opponent was a different story.\nAs the excited seniors prepared to rush out, Choi Woong’s flustered voice stopped them.\n\"A-Are you going to find him right now?\"\n\"Of course!\"\n\"Well… I don't know if the Young Master will accept.\"\nThey all looked at him with a look of incomprehension.\n“What kind of bullshit is that? How could a warrior of the cult refuse a fight?”\n“Yeah! From what you and Ho-yeol said, he sounds incredibly strong. Strong people never back down from a challenge!”\nShouting confidently, the seniors left the Black Tiger Pavilion and headed towards the Black Dragon Pavilion.\n“Hahaha! I’ll get in one good rematch too!”\nEven Mak Ho-yeol, who had already been defeated, joined them.\nLooking at the empty spaces left by the seniors who had vanished in an instant, Choi Woong muttered with a sour expression.\n\"...The Young Master will definitely hate this.\"\nAfter a month of observation, Choi Woong had learned something about Il-mok. The Eighth Young Master disliked duels. To be precise, he found them bothersome.\nSuddenly, Choi Woong realized something important and his face paled.\n‘Fuck. They won’t sell me out, right?’\nA horde of seniors demanding a spar… Il-mok would be utterly annoyed.\nAnd what happens if the Eighth Young Master found out this whole mess happened because of him?\n‘Heavenly Demon, please have mercy on this poor lamb.’\nChoi Woong closed his eyes and prayed to the Heavenly Demon, who was probably busy with work at the main headquarters.\nWhile Choi Woong was trembling in fear for his life...\nThe disciples who had left Black Tiger Pavilion crossed the training grounds using light movement techniques and arrived at Black Dragon Pavilion.\nThe first-year disciples were startled by the sudden arrival of the seniors.\n\"Where is Disciple Il-mok?\"\n\"Disciple Il-mok, come out at once!\"\nAs all the senior disciples began looking for Il-mok, his peers all had similar thoughts.\n‘Why are they looking for the Young Master?’\nJust then, Mak Ho-yeol spotted Il-mok just coming out of the bathhouse after finishing his bath and shouted.\n\"There he is, that junior!\"\nAll eyes naturally turned to Il-mok.\nFresh from his bath, Il-mok frowned at the sight of them.\n‘Great. He dragged his friends here to gang up on me.’\nIl-mok thought that Mak Ho-yeol had brought his friends for revenge.\nHe wasn't afraid of being ganged up on.\n‘Fuck. I just finished washing up…’\nHe just didn’t want to sweat again.\nMeanwhile, led by Baek Cheon, the seniors all approached Il-mok, and his peers parted like the Red Sea to make way for him.\nExcept for a few.\n“What brings you seniors here?”\n\"Swarming like this isn't exactly a pleasant sight.\"\nThe ones who stepped forward to block the seniors beside Il-mok were none other than Dokgo Pae and Bang Mi-hwa.\nFlustered by her friend's sudden action, Ha Young also belatedly stood beside Bang Mi-hwa.\n\"As someone who will be the young master's attendant in the future, I cannot stand by!\"\nSeeing an opportunity to impress Il-mok, Ju Seo-yeon also blocked their path.\nAnd then…\n\"Huff. Huff.\"\nJeong Hyeon, breathing heavily from the commotion, also approached Il-mok, although still maintaining a distance.\nThe atmosphere quickly turned hostile, especially between the two at the forefront.\n\"As the representative of this year's class, I cannot tolerate your aggressive behavior, seniors.”\nBaik Cheon sneered at Dokgo Pae, who kept insisting that he was the representative of his year despite being beaten by Il-mok at every turn.\n\"The blood of the Dokgo Family really doesn't change. Look at you, you are only second in rank, but insisting that you are the representative.”\nProvoked, Dokgo Pae's face contorted as he retorted.\n“Better than being a good-for-nothing.”\n\"It seems the junior wants to die today.\"\n\"You think I'm scared of you?\"\nThe tension between the two, fueled by the long-standing rivalry between the Dokgo and Baek Families, escalated to the point where they seemed ready to draw their weapons.\nBut taut tension snapped quite anticlimactically.\n\"H-hey, where are you going!\"\nThis was because Il-mok had already turned his back and was heading to his room.\nWhen Park Gi-tae belatedly discovered this and hurriedly shouted, everyone's attention naturally shifted from Dokgo Pae and Baek Cheon to Il-mok.\n'Damn. Busted.’\nIl-mok clicked his tongue in disappointment and turned around without hiding his annoyed expression.\n\"Their quarrel has nothing to do with me, so I thought I'd head back in.\"\nMak Ho-yeol laughed heartily hearing that.\n\"Hahaha! Their quarrel has nothing to do with us either. We came looking for you, junior.\"\n\"For me?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"For what purpose?\"\n\"We came because we want to fight with you.\"\n\"So, why do you want to fight me?\"\n\"Hahaha. You ask something so obvious. Isn’t it only natural you’d want to fight them?”\nIl-mok’s face crumpled.\n’Why is that natural, you lunatics?’\nThat reply rose to Il-mok's throat before he swallowed it back.\nSurrounded by lunatics, he felt like the normal one was becoming the weirdo.\nWhile contemplating how to send these madmen away, Il-mok came up with a suitable excuse.\n\"That's not possible.\"\nMak Ho-yeol, who looked surprised as if he hadn't imagined a refusal, exclaimed. Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs novelfire(.)net\n\"Why not?!\"\n\"Unofficial duels between disciples are subject to penalty points.\"\n\"...Didn't you just fight with me a little while ago?\"\nMak Ho-yeol asked with an incredulous look. But Il-mok had already prepared an excuse.\n\"That was in a secluded place, and it was just you, senior. But with all of you rushing in and making a scene like this, we're bound to get caught.\"\n\"......\"\nHis logic was sound, yet it leaves everyone speechless.\nWhile everyone was flustered by Il-mok's roundabout logic and couldn't retort…\n“So, how about this? Tomorrow, let’s find an instructor in the afternoon after our training. That’s all.”\nHaving said his piece, Il-mok turned around and went back to his room.\n\"......\"\n\"......\"\nWith their target gone, silence briefly fell over Black Dragon Pavilion.\n\"Ahem.\"\nAnd the embarrassed seniors began to turn back one by one and return to Black Tiger Pavilion.\n“I’ll deal with you properly another time.\"\n\"Hmph. You're welcome anytime.\"\nIn the meantime, Baek Cheon and Dokgo Pae continued their battle of nerves.\nThe next day.\nA strange tension filled the Hall of the Demonic Way from the morning.\nBecause of the previous night's events, the disciples kept glancing at Il-mok, anticipating his afternoon showdown with the seniors.\nA few even approached him during training.\n\"It'll be tough to face all those senior guys alone. I'll handle a few of them for you. Especially that Baek Family guy, despite his slippery attitude, he’s no slouch, so he might be too much for you. Leave him to me.\"\nDokgo Pae suddenly took Il-mok's side, as if they had been close from the beginning.\n\"Hoho. It seems like a good opportunity for me to cross swords with the seniors as well.\"\nBang Mi-hwa, pretending to be haughty while volunteering to help Il-mok. She was enchanted by her own coolness in helping a man who admired her.\n\"Don't worry. I have something in mind.\"\nOf course, Il-mok, finding both their approaches burdensome, tried to brush them off with a vague reply, but…\n“Hah! Don't be shy. Even rivals should join forces against a common enemy.”\n\"That's right, Young Master. There's no need to be embarrassed. I understand your feelings too.\"\n\"......\"\nIl-mok sighed at their nonsense.\nHe thought it was fortunate that Ju Seo-yeon was in the Lower Class. If she had been here as well, he would have been driven mad.\nSeeing him sigh, Dokgo Pae and Bang Mi-hwa nodded knowingly.\n“It must be a heavy burden. Don't worry. We’ll be there for you.”\n“Just trust me, Young Master.”\n\"......\"\nIl-mok squeezed his eyes shut.\n‘Maybe I should just quit the Hall altogether...’\nThen he pictured his master’s furious face brandishing his blade, and the thought vanished as quickly as it came.\nAfter all the training hours had passed.\nWithout fail, after finishing his bath, Il-mok headed to the dining hall to find about a dozen senior disciples standing at the entrance.\n\"We've already eaten, so go ahead and have your meal.\"\n“Yeah. You can’t fight on an empty stomach.”\nIt was unnecessary consideration.\nSo Il-mok began his meal under the gaze of about a dozen people.\nNo, they weren't all.\nThanks to those damned seniors, everyone else had gathered to stare at Il-mok too.\nIt was enough to make anyone lose their appetite, but Il-mok simply shoved food into his mouth with an annoyed expression.\nAfter finishing his meal, Il-mok rose and left the dining hall.\n\"Well then, let's find an instructor together.\"\nHe turned and headed towards the instructors' office, followed by fifteen seniors and a few of his classmates.\nAnd upon entering the office, his expression involuntarily wrinkled.\n‘Damn. Of all people, it had to be him.’\nThe other instructors were nowhere to be seen. Only Chu Il-hwan remained.\nSeeing Il-mok suddenly arrive with a crowd of senior disciples pouring in behind him, Chu Il-hwan, for some reason, wore a mischievous grin.\n\"Hoh. You said you liked 'women', yet you seem surprisingly more popular with men.\"\nIl-mok shuddered at his frivolous joke.\n'Damn. Has he still not given up?'\nThis was why he didn't want to get tangled with that instructor.\nWith a deep sigh, Il-mok thought, 'Can't be helped.'\nHe had come this far. There was no turning back.\nOf course, Il-mok had no intention of fighting those seniors whatsoever.\nThe plan he had come up with yesterday was, of course, not just a plan to avoid last night.\nWith a sigh, Il-mok composed himself and looked at Chu Il-hwan with a solemn expression.\nChu Il-hwan’s smile widened at the sight.\n‘Hehehe. This is going to be fun.’\nHaving been around the candidates, he was aware of the rumors.\nHe knew Il-mok had come to spar with the seniors.\nAs Chu Il-hwan and the seniors watched Il-mok with anticipation…\nIl-mok put the plan he had conceived into action.\nThe reason he had deliberately led the seniors to find an instructor was simple.\n\"Instructor. Since last night, the seniors have been constantly coming to disturb my training and bullying me.\"\nIt was to report them for bullying.",

    "content": "Chapter 75: Seniors (4) Chapters fırst released on noⅴelfire.net\nJust after Ilmok laid out his accusation with a solemn expression.\n\".......\"\nAn awkward silence descended upon the office.\nIn the martial arts-obsessed Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, and especially within the Hall of the Demonic Way, this was an unprecedented event.\nEven Instructor Chu Il-hwan who usually wore a playful smile had a blank expression as if something had short-circuited in his mind.\nAnd soon after.\n\"Wh-Wh-What are you talking about, junior!\"\n\"Us, bullying you?!\"\n“We came to ask you to observe our duel!”\n“Disciple Il-mok, explain yourself to us right now!”\nA storm of protests erupted as the seniors recovered from their shock.\nAgainst their indignant cries, Il-mok deliberately widened his eyes until they became bloodshot and shouted, “So many of you ganging up on me and forcing me to fight… is that really fair? I'm a junior! This is clearly bullying, not a fair duel!”\nBecause he kept his eyes wide open without blinking, a single tear even rolled down his cheek at the end.\n“Even though our cult reveres martial strength, it’s for punishing evil. Is ganging up on a weaker person truly in line with the cult’s teachings?”\nFaced with this passionate outcry from an alleged victim of school violence, the accused perpetrators couldn't open their mouths.\nThey knew something was off, but the seniors couldn't figure out how to articulate it.\nThen, Mak Ho-yeol, the most simple-minded of the bunch, exclaimed, “Weaker?! You defeated me yesterday!”\nFinally realizing the contradiction, Baek Cheon chimed in, \"That's right. While it’s true that many of us pressured you, Disciple Il-mok is clearly not weak.\"\nIl-mok almost clicked his tongue unconsciously but managed to maintain his expression.\n'They're not falling for it so easily.'\nHowever, he still had the moral high ground.\n“Compared to you seniors, aren't juniors naturally weaker? And the fact remains that many of you ganged up on me.”\nAs Il-mok pointed this out, the fifteen seniors started shouting over each other.\n\"What nonsense!\"\n\"This is a misunderstanding!\"\n\"We never intended to fight you all at once!\"\nAs everyone shouted over each other, Chu Il-hwan rose with an uncharacteristically serious expression.\n“Silence! Any disciple who continues to make noise will be severely punished.”\nHearing this, the seniors reluctantly shut their mouths.\nOnce the office was quiet, Chu Il-hwan looked over the intruders and said, “I understand why you came to me. However, this isn’t something I can decide on my own. I will discuss this with the other instructors and make a decision. You are all dismissed.”\nThe moment his eyes met Il-mok's at the end, Chu Il-hwan flashed a mischievous grin.\n'What is he planning?'\nIl-mok felt his hair stand on end as an ominous sensation washed over him.\nThat night, a meeting was held in the Hall Master's chamber within the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nSeated at the head of the table was Yeom Ga-hwi, the Hall Master of the Demonic Way. Next to him sat Yu Geuk, the Vice Hall Master of the Demonic Way, known by the title Ice Demon Saber. His face was cold and expressionless.\nThe seat opposite Yu Geuk was empty, and beside it sat Chu Il-hwan. The female instructor took her seat opposite Chu Il-hwan.\nChu Il-hwan was the Primary Instructor for the new disciples, while Cha Eun-yeong was the Primary Instructor for the senior disciples.\n\"Instructor Chu.\"\n\"Yes, Hall Master.\"\n\"Begin.\"\nFollowing Yeom Ga-hwi’s instructions, Chu Il-hwan explained the day's events.\nIt was Chu Il-hwan who had requested this meeting.\nAs soon as Chu Il-hwan finished his explanation, Yeom Ga-hwi frowned and said:\n“This is certainly an unprecedented case.”\n\"Yes, Hall Master.\"\nWhile occasional disputes between seniors and juniors occurred, this was different.\nNot only had no junior ever reported seniors for bullying, but there had never been a case where a group of seniors ganged up on a junior to demand a duel.\nThis was because one year of training in Demonic Arts created a significant gap in ability.\nIn almost every conflict between seniors and juniors, the seniors would win. Thus, seniors rarely bothered to challenge juniors.\nAs talented members of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, they were interested in fighting strong opponents, not weak ones.\nYu Geuk, who had been quietly listening to Chu Il-hwan's explanation and organizing his thoughts, looked at Chu Il-hwan with a cold expression.\n“But in essence, this could be resolved by simply refusing the duel request or forbidding the seniors from entering the Black Dragon Pavilion. The fact that you called this meeting suggests you have another solution in mind, Instructor Chu.”\nIn response to the Vice Hall Master's piercing insight, Chu Il-hwan tried to hide his expression behind his characteristically playful smile.\n\"Yes. I have one plan in mind, but I felt I needed the approval of the Hall Master as well as Instructor Cha, which is why I arranged this meeting, Vice Hall Master.\"\nHearing Chu Il-hwan’s response, the female instructor sitting across from him, Cha Eun-yeong, hardened her expression.\n\"My approval? What kind of pointless scheme are you plotting now?\"\nChu Il-hwan only grinned shamelessly.\n\"Unnecessary? It will greatly benefit all the disciples.”\nAs Chu Il-hwan and Cha Eunyeong were about to engage in a battle of wills, the Hall Master spoke up:\n\"Be mindful of your words, Instructor Chu. This is an official business.”\n\"...My apologies, Hall Master.\"\nUnexpectedly, Chu Il-hwan showed a respectful attitude towards the Hall Master.\nThanks to Yeom Ga-hwi's intervention, Instructor Cha Eunyeong, whose momentum had deflated, snorted and said, \"So, what is this scheme you've devised?\"\n\"It's simple. We'll hold a sparring competition between the new disciples under my charge and the senior disciples under Instructor Cha's supervision. A martial arts exchange, so to speak, to foster camaraderie between seniors and juniors.”\nThis was a sparring event that had never been held before.\nThe reason was simple. The gap between the seniors and juniors is too wide.\nCha Eun-yeong naturally pointed this out, but Chu Il-hwan replied slyly, “Now, now, it would at the very least be beneficial for the juniors, no? And if we make this competition a regular event, this year's class can pass on their knowledge to their juniors next year. Additionally, it could provide motivation for the seniors as well.\"\n\"Motivation?\"\nAs Cha Eun-yeong tilted her head in confusion, Yu Geuk spoke up.\n\"You mean that Young Master?\"\n\"Yes. If they realize they're being chased by or even overtaken by a junior one year below them, wouldn't that push them to work harder?\"\nYeom Ga-hwi, who had been listening quietly, nodded in agreement. It wasn't a bad idea.\nThe next morning.\nIt was time for Instructor Chu Il-hwan's martial arts class.\nHowever, instead of starting the lesson right away, Instructor Chu Il-hwan announced that he had something to share.\n\"Five days from now, an official sparring competition will be held between you and the senior disciples. This is an opportunity to exchange notes with your seniors who have trained longer than you, which will greatly help improve your skills. This is all possible thanks to Disciple Il-mok, so let's give him a round of applause.”\nAs soon as he finished, the Upper Class disciples all turned to Il-mok and applauded.\n‘Damn it. So that's why he was grinning.’\nIl-mok sighed as he realized the source of the unease he'd felt earlier.\nJust then, Dokgo Pae raised his hand and asked Instructor Chu Il-hwan a question, \"Instructor! What are the rules for the competition? Do we have to avoid injuries like in the last test?”\n\"Hahaha. Don't worry about that. The ones who should be concerned are not you, but your seniors.\"\nEveryone easily understood Chu Il-hwan's meaning.\nGiven the skill gap, even if they tried their best, it would be difficult for them to injure their seniors.\nSome accepted this as a matter of course, but Dokgo Pae and Bang Mi-hwa looked offended.\n\"Also, since the Hall Master, Vice Hall Master, and all instructors will be observing this competition, serious injuries are unlikely to occur.\"\nAs soon as Chu Il-hwan finished his explanation, Il-mok raised his hand.\nThere was an issue more important than injuries.\n\"How will the sparring opponents be selected?\"\nSince the competition was a result of yesterday's incident, he was worried that this crazy instructor might make him fight all fifteen seniors one after another.\nIn response to Il-mok's question, Chu Il-hwan smiled playfully and answered, \"It will be one-on-one, and your opponents will be matched according to each disciple’s academic performance. Each disciple will participate in only one match.\"\nIl-mok sighed in relief internally.\n'Just one match, huh? Like the sparring with the teaching assistant last time, I’ll just fight half-heartedly and pretend to lose.'\nJust then, Instructor Chu Il-hwan's voice snapped Il-mok back to attention.\n\"Over the past month, and through the recent exam, I've come to know your abilities very well. So, if any of you try any funny business or fight half-heartedly during the match, you will have a ‘special meeting’ with me.”\nChu Il-hwan deliberately emphasized the words 'funny business,' ‘half-heartedly,' and 'special meeting.'\n“Hahaha! What are you talking about, Instructor? How could a warrior of our cult fight a battle half-heartedly?”\n\"We'll gain enlightenment through sparring with our seniors!\"\nAmidst the Upper Class disciple who was full of excitement and motivation...\n'I'm screwed.'\n...There was Il-mok with a crumpled face.\nA special meeting with that lecherous instructor… the thought alone made him shudder.\nSeeing the Young Master fail to manage his expression this time, Chu Il-hwan formed an even happier smile.\n'Hehehe. This is going to be fun.’\nNot only would he get to see the true extent of the Eighth Young Master’s hidden skills…\n'Hehehe. I'll completely wreck that bitch Cha Eun-yeong's expression!'\nSeeing the senior disciples, whom she had diligently taught for over a year, get crushed by new disciples would surely make her eyes roll back in her head.\nHe didn't know about the other disciple, but he was sure that as long as Il-mok didn’t hold back, he would win against the seniors.\n\"And finally, there will be a reward for this sparring competition.\"\n\"A reward, you say?\"\nWhen Dokgo Pae asked again, Chu Il-hwan nodded.\n\"That's right. Since the Hall Master and Vice Hall Master will also be observing this competition, the disciples who show remarkable performance will have the additional opportunity to receive instruction from either the Hall Master or Vice Hall Master.\"\nThe disciples’ eyes sparkled. Yeom Ga-hwi was one of the strongest in the cult, and Yu Geuk, while not as strong as the Hall Master, was still incredibly powerful in the eyes of the disciples.\nThen, Choi Woong muttered with a sullen expression,\n“Then wouldn’t the seniors get the reward anyway?”\nIt was an offensive remark, but Chu Il-hwan just smiled playfully.\n\"Don't worry. Both the Hall Master and Vice Hall Master are excellent people. The reward won’t be based solely on victory or defeat, but on ‘performance.’ If you perform exceptionally well for your age, you’ll stand out.”\nRight after the talk about the martial arts exchange event came out, the atmosphere in the Hall of the Demonic Way became heated.\nThe new disciple devoted themselves to training in order to pose even a slight threat to their seniors.\nMeanwhile, the senior disciples who should have been more relaxed instead braced themselves.\nIt wasn't just because of Il-mok.\n\"I don't think any of you'll lose. But if even one of you shows bad performance, I swear on my name as an instructor, I will not let you off easy.”\nThanks to Instructor Cha Eun-yeong’s relentless and terrifying pressure, they too, had no choice but to grit their teeth and devote themselves to training.\nOn top of that, everyone dreamed of catching the eye of the Hall Master or Vice Hall Master for those private lessons. Whether first‑year or second‑year, they all trained with burning intensity.\nTime flew like an arrow, and soon the morning of the sparring competition arrived.",

    "content": "Chapter 76: Martial Arts Competition (1)\nThe day of the martial arts competition had arrived.\nIl-mok woke up and sighed faintly.\n\"Damn it. It's today already.\"\nIl-mok had absolutely no interest in the martial arts competition or the Hall Master’s teachings.\n‘I need to seriously screw over that damn homo instructor...’\nSettling the score with that wretched man was the only thing Il-mok gave a damn these days.\nAbsorbed with such petty thoughts, Il-mok finished his bath and breakfast, and before he knew it, he had arrived at the training grounds where the martial arts competition was scheduled to be held.\n\"Check today's match order,\" said Chu Il-hwan, Il-mok's target, as he posted a notice on the wall.\nEveryone swarmed the notice board to check their turn and find out who their opponent was. Slipping away from the cadets, Chu Il-hwan flashed a mischievous grin at Il-mok.\n'I'll get you back.'\nWith no suitable plan in mind, Il-mok silently vowed revenge as he headed toward the notice.\nChecking the various names written there, Il-mok hummed thoughtfully.\n'So it’s skill-based matchmaking.'\nIl-mok's turn was last. Right before him was Dokgo Pae, while Ju Seo-yeon was scheduled to go first.\nRoughly grasping the situation, Il-mok was about to go on his way when Dokgo Pae approached him.\n\"Young Master Il-mok. Have you checked who your opponent is?\"\n\"I've seen it.\"\nIl-mok didn't want to get involved with a mad dog, so he kept his words short, but Dokgo Pae continued to talk.\n“Then you must know. Your opponent is none other than that good-for-nothing from the Baek Family.”\n\"...He didn't seem that way to me.\"\nAren't you the good-for-nothing? Il-mok hid his inner thoughts as he replied.\n“Hmph. He may act like he has come to his senses ever since coming to the Hall of the Demonic Way, but he was quite infamous before enrolling here. Even now, he must be struggling to maintain his act of having turned over a new leaf.\"\nIl-mok let Dokgo Pae's slander go in one ear and out the other.\nHe already knew from Jin Hayeon, during his preparation to enter the Hall, that the Baek Family and the Dokgo Family weren't on good terms.\n\"So, what exactly do you want to tell me?\"\nWhen Il-mok asked this to stop the pointless gossip, Dokgo Pae answered with a serious face.\n“Ideally, I’d have liked to crush that good-for-nothing's arrogance myself, but since you ended up matched with him, I’ll tell you about his martial arts.”\n\"You mean Baek Cheon's martial arts?\"\n\"Yes. That good-for-nothing is still a direct descendant of the Baek Family, so he is skilled in using hidden weapons.\"\nAs expected.\nIl-mok nodded.\nThe Baek Family’s moniker was the Hundred Shadows Baek Family. Meaning, they carry numerous hidden weapons throughout their body. They are a family famous for their hidden weapon techniques.\n“You are saying he will constantly throw shurikens or hidden weapons during the match, right?”\n“That’s right. And to think they had the gall to call themselves a martial artist of the cult; they are despicable.”\nDokgo Pae's statement perfectly demonstrated why the Dokgo Family and the Hundred Shadows Baek Family were enemies.\nBut Il-mok had no interest in the affairs between the Baek Family and the Dokgo Family. Instead, his attention was drawn elsewhere.\n'Wait, if I use this well...?'\nA plan for petty revenge against Chu Ilhwan formed in Il-mok’s mind, and he smiled.\n“Thanks for the tip.”\nDokgo Pae’s lips twitched into a matching smile.\n\"I'm counting on Young Master Il-mok.\"\nDokgo Pae.\nHis reason for sharing this information with Il-mok wasn't simply because he disliked Baek Cheon.\n‘The Eighth Young Master already had a run-in with that senior, Mak Ho-yeol or whatever his name was. The seniors must already be familiar with the Young Master's martial arts. It's an unfair fight!’\nThis was his surface reason.\nAs the eldest grandson of the dignified and righteous Dokgo clan, he couldn't stand by and watch such an unfair fight...\nIn truth, that was just an excuse.\n‘For now, the Eighth Young Master is a step above me. But, if the Youngest Master beats that good-for-nothing, and then I beat the Eighth Young Master, it ultimately means I'm superior to that Baek Family’s good-for-nothing!’\nThis was the perfect plan he had come up with after racking his simple brain.\nEspecially since Baek Cheon was one year ahead and would graduate from the Hall earlier.\nHe reached the astounding conclusion that even after Baek Cheon graduated, as long as he himself eventually defeated the Young Master, it would count as having beaten Baek Cheon.\n\"Hahaha.\"\n\"Hehehehehe.\"\nThus, the two young men laughed deviously while harboring completely different dreams.\nSoon after Il-mok got some useful information from Dokgo Pae, the instructors gathered, followed by the Hall Master and Vice Hall Master.\nOn the opposite side, the senior disciples had already gathered and, like Il-mok's class, were checking their match order.\nOnce everyone had assembled, the martial arts competition soon began.\nAs Il-mok had confirmed earlier, Ju Seo-yeon was scheduled to go first.\n\"Begin!\"\nAs soon as the instructor who acted as a referee gave the signal, Ju Seo-yeon and the senior disciple began to move.\nClang!\nJu Seo-yeon couldn’t even last ten exchanges before her spear was forced upward.\nPat!\nThe senior disciple broke through her faltering stance and sealed her acupoint with a finger technique, causing her to freeze in place.\n'Hmm. She seemed to have improved quite a bit recently, but I guess the gap between juniors and seniors is still significant.'\nThat was Il-mok's simple assessment as he watched the match.\nThe competition continued after that. As Il-mok had expected, the matches seemed to be arranged by skill level, with all the lower-ranked disciples going first.\nIl-mok didn't pay much attention to his peers since he didn’t know most of their names, but a few did catch his eye.\n'Smart, but his martial arts are somewhat lacking.'\nThe bookish-looking disciple who had been on Dokgo Pae's team during the last test left early and was defeated instantly.\nNext, Jeong Hyeon stepped into the center of the training ground.\nConsidering the decent performance he had shown in the last exam, it was an unusual order. Especially considering that he had performed much better than Choi Woong, who was in the Upper Class on the last test.\nBut Il-mok, who had examined the previous martial arts matches, was able to grasp the situation in his own way.\n'Did they arrange it in order of pure martial arts skill rather than simple grades?'\nJeong Hyeon's archery and other skills were much more useful in actual combat than in this kind of simple head-on confrontation.\n“P-Please take care of me.”\nStepping into the center of the training ground, Jeong Hyeon made a fist-and-palm salute while trembling and spoke in a voice as quiet as an ant crawling.\nAfter taking his position about six meters away from the senior disciple, Jeong Hyeon raised his bow.\n\"Begin!\"\nAs soon as the instructor's command fell, the senior disciple lunged toward Jeong Hyeon.\nSwoosh!\nJeong Hyeon fired the arrow he had already nocked and then—\nPat!\nHe immediately used his footwork to create distance between himself and the senior.\nBut arrows shot openly from the front without any cover were bound to lose much of their effectiveness.\nClang!\nThe senior disciple calmly dodged the arrows Jeong Hyeon fired while gradually closing in on him.\n\"Eek!?\"\nFinally, when the distance between them narrowed to about three meters, Jeong Hyeon let out a strange gasp and froze completely.\nPat!\nNot missing the opening created by Jeong Hyeon's hesitation, the senior quickly moved in and held his sword right in front of Jeong Hyeon's face before stopping.\nRight after the spar ended.\nUnpleasant comments circulated among those watching.\n\"Tsk. Pathetic.\"\n\"How can someone who is called a warrior of the Divine Cult be so weak?\"\n\"I guess archery has its limits.\"\n\"There's still a lot of time left in the Hall of the Demonic Way, so I think it would be better for him to learn new martial arts.\"\nSome of these comments came from Il-mok's classmates, while others came from the senior disciples.\nNaturally, Il-mok's brow furrowed.\n'Stupid bastards.'\nHe wasn't angry just because they were belittling Jeong Hyeon, though that did irritate him.\n‘'Is there nothing in their heads but head-on fights?'\nRather, he frowned because they genuinely seemed too stupid.\nHonestly, among all the martial arts of the disciples present, Il-mok feared Jeong Hyeon's archery the most.\nHe was confident he could handle the others' martial arts to some extent since they were all meant to be used openly.\nOf course, this newfound courage was all thanks to Heavenly Demon's teachings.\nThanks to countless sparring sessions with Heavenly Demon, the greatest master of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, Il-mok had become unfazed by most attacks.\nBut what about an arrow flying unexpectedly from an unseen location during a chaotic battle?\nNo. Even if it wasn't in the middle of a chaotic battle, what if someone sniped him with a bow from far away while he was sleeping?\nFurthermore.\n‘There's no need to fight head-on, sweating buckets, right? I can just hide and laze around, and when the target comes, I can snipe them. Bang! Haa… Maybe I should have learned archery too.’\nTo Il-mok, who valued rest and efficiency, archery was the best martial art.\nWhile Il-mok was lost in such thoughts, Jeong Hyeon, having finished his match, was returning to his peers with his shoulders hunched.\nIl-mok, who had been watching the matches with an indifferent face from a corner until now, moved toward Jeong Hyeon.\n\"Don't take it too hard. I know your true value, Disciple Jeong.\"\n\"My, my t-true v-value, you say?\"\nFor some reason, Jeong-hyeon’s shoulders became even more hunched at Il-mok’s support. On top of that, he lowered his head, looking completely intimidated.\n'...Did I say something unnecessary?'\nFeeling somewhat awkward, Il-mok left one more word of praise before shifting his gaze back to where the matches were taking place.\n\"Ahem. I'm sure others will recognize it someday too.\"\nThe matches continued after Jeong Hyeon's.\nOnce the Lower Class disciples were done, it was time for the spars of the Upper Class disciples like Il-mok.\n\"Ohohoho!\"\nEven while being pushed back by a senior disciple, Bang Mi-hwa burst into strange laughter, trying her best to appear composed before eventually losing.\nAnd in Dokgo Pae's case.\n\"Try to block this too, senior!\"\n\"Wahahahaha! Excellent!\"\nAs it happened, he ended up in a spirited fight with someone of similar temperament named Mak Ho-yeol. The rıghtful source is N0velFire.ɴet\nThey took turns showcasing their best techniques, clashing their sword and saber relentlessly.\nThere was no yielding, no retreating, and they did not try to avoid each other's techniques.\nDokgo Pae relentlessly demonstrated the Dokgo Nine Swords, famous for its strong swordplay and aggressive attacks, while Mak Ho-yeol parried them all with his swift saber techniques.\n\"If you block even this, I'll admit defeat!\"\n\"Bring it on!\"\nFinally, Dokgo Pae displayed his most powerful technique.\nMassive internal energy flowed through his great sword, forming a heavy Sword Qi.\n\"Excellent!!\"\nMak Ho-yeol's eyes gleamed as he swung his saber in response, striking Dokgo Pae's great sword repeatedly.\nWatching their intense match, Il-mok thought, 'What happened to their footwork?'\nMoreover, blood was now trickling from the corner of Dokgo Pae's mouth as he performed his final technique.\nIt meant he was continuing to face his opponent head-on despite accumulating internal injuries.\n'Ugh, ignorant bastards.'\nIl-mok simply couldn't comprehend their 'romance-filled' battle.\nMeanwhile, Mak Ho-yeol's saber continued to strike Dokgo Pae's great sword repeatedly.\n\"Kuk.\"\nFinally, the greatsword lost its power and stopped. Dokgo Pae, suffering internal injuries, let out a faint groan.\nEven so, Dokgo Pae stood firm, retrieved his sword and made a fist-and-palm salute to Mak Ho-yeol, showing his respect.\n\"I admit my defeat. Senior.\"\n“Hahaha! I never knew we had such an excellent junior. Thanks to you, I feel like my eyes have been greatly opened!”\nThe atmosphere was as if they had found long-lost brothers.\nIl-mok felt dizzy at the thought that those two might soon become sworn brothers.\n'Damn it. Are they going to come together now?'\nAs Il-mok shuddered at the dreadful thought, his nearby peers wore tense expressions.\n'Could he be disappointed?'\n‘Well... knowing the Young Master, that might be it.’\n‘Yeah. Based on what the seniors said back then, Young Master had even won against that Senior Mak Ho-yeol.’\nThe reason for their thoughts was simple.\nSo far, nineteen matches had been fought, and their record was a complete defeat.\nThough they had expected the seniors to be better, such a one-sided result was bound to be shocking.\nAt that moment, as Mak Ho-yeol and Dokgo Pae stepped back, the instructor called the next pair of disciples.\n\"Disciple Il-mok and Disciple Baek Cheon, come forward!\"\nWith that instruction, Il-mok, who had been shaking his head, clicked his tongue with an unpleasant expression before stepping forward.\nLooking at Il-mok’s back as he walked toward the center of the training grounds, his classmates thought.\n'Yes! If it's the Young Master, he might win!'\n'We all lost, but the grand battle will be different!'\nHaving reached this strange conclusion, the classmates called out to Il-mok.\n\"Young Master Il-mok, you can do it!\"\n\"Young Master Il-mok is the pride of our class!\"\n\"You can win if it's you!\"\nSuddenly, Il-mok had become the sole hope of his classmates.",

    "content": "Chapter 77: Martial Arts Competition (2)\nHearing unexpected cheers, I instinctively turned to look behind me.\nMeeting the gazes of my classmates mixed with faith and expectation, I couldn't help but think.\n'Why are they suddenly acting friendly?'\nI couldn't understand at all why the guys who had been distant until now were suddenly acting like this.\nOf course, I was the one who drew the line in the first place, but even taking that into account, it still didn't make sense.\n'...Well. I don't really need to understand the thought process of these lunatics anyway.'\nJust as I was about to brush it off like that, Ju Seo-yeon suddenly stepped forward and began to lead the cheering.\n\"Young Master Il-mok! We believe in you! The Demonic Way's Number One Prodigy, Young Master Il-mok!\"\nShe waved the spear slung on her back vigorously as if it were a cheering prop.\n‘...Don't tell me she thinks I actually like being cheered on?’\nHer intentions were obvious. She was trying to get on my good side so she could become my attendant after graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way.\n‘I don’t know what the other lunatics are thinking, but why the fuck can I grasp the intentions of the craziest one?!’\nI decided it was because I had already met Ouyang Mun who was similar to her.\nSeemingly inspired by Ju Seo-yeon's boldness, Bang Mi-hwa also stepped forward and began spouting nonsense.\n\"Hohoho. Young Master Il-mok! If you avenge us, I'll make time for you!\"\nDue to these two women's absurd comments, the cheering from my peers grew even more intense.\nMeanwhile, Jeong Hyeon, who couldn't adapt to the heated atmosphere, was standing alone far away, silently mouthing words in my direction.\nI shook my head at the chaotic scene and turned back around.\n\"Hoho. He seems quite shy, doesn't he?\"\nBang Mi-hwa's strange comment reached my ears, but I chose to ignore it. Because a crazier person no less than Bang Mi-hwa was approaching head-on.\n\"Young Master Il-mok. I lost, but I believe that you'll flatten that good-for-nothing's nose.\"\nEven Dokgo Pae was looking at me with burning camaraderie in his eyes, as if we had been close friends all along.\nThere were lunatics everywhere.\nWatching the Eighth Young Master receive passionate support from his peers, Baek Cheon thought to himself.\n'It's as if I've become the villain here.'\nHe wasn't particularly bothered by it.\nBecause the satisfaction of crushing someone with such high expectations was unparalleled.\nDokgo Pae's assessment of Baek Cheon was somewhat accurate.\nBaek Cheon, who had been known as the Baek Family troublemaker before entering the Hall of the Demonic Way, hadn't actually reformed.\nHe had simply discovered a more efficient approach.\nActing with dignity rather than wreaking havoc by acting as he pleased made it easier to get what he wanted in the long run.\n'Defeat the Eighth Young Master and win the Hall Master’s favor.'\nIt was absolutely necessary to strengthen his position within the family after graduating from the academy.\nBut that didn't mean he underestimated the Eighth Young Master. Since he had won against that boar-like Mak Ho-yeol, he must be a formidable opponent.\nBut Baek Cheon believed he would win if he gave it his all.\n'Hehehe. I get to see the disappointed faces of the juniors and gain the Hall Master's attention. Killing two birds with one stone.'\nWhile Baek Cheon was inwardly chuckling sinisterly, he maintained a confident expression outside.\nIl-mok had already taken his position opposite him, and the instructor's shout rang out.\n\"Begin!\"\nDespite the instructor's signal, Il-mok didn't rush toward Baek Cheon.\n\"Hmm?\"\nNoticing the defensive stance, Baek Cheon waved his fan leisurely and said, \"Hohoho. You are more timid than I expected. Very well, I shall come to you.\"\nAs he finished speaking, Baek Cheon swung his arm through the air, sending hidden weapons that had been concealed between his fingers flying toward Il-mok.\nHe had secretly drawn these weapons from his sleeve while talking.\nAs several projectiles cut through the air toward him, Il-mok employed his footwork, darting here and there to avoid them.\n\"Hehehe.\"\nSeeing Il-mok desperately dodging or blocking without daring to approach, Baek Cheon continued to press his attack with the expression of a predator toying with its prey.\n\"Hmm.\"\nNot long after the most anticipated final match began, Chu Il-hwan slightly furrowed his brow.\n'I clearly warned him that there would be a special interview if he hid his skills again.'\nThe sight of the Eighth Young Master merely dodging and blocking rather than attacking was concerning.\nInstructor Cha Eun-young, watching alongside him, spoke mockingly to Chu Il-hwan.\n\"They called him a genius, but he doesn't seem like much.\"\nAs Chu Il-hwan was considering how to respond to his rival's provocation...\nSwoosh!\nSuddenly, a feathered dart flew directly toward his face.\nPat!\nHaving been momentarily distracted, Chu Il-hwan hurriedly swung his right hand, barely managing to block the dart.\n'Whew. I almost made a fool of myself.'\nThe dart had been thrown by Baek Cheon toward Il-mok. It was just that Il-mok had dodged it, and it happened to fly toward Chu Il-hwan who was standing behind him.\nTo be hit by a stray hidden weapon thrown by a disciple. If that had happened, his reputation as an instructor would have plummeted.\n\"Pfft. Look at you floundering.\"\nCha Eun-yeong provoked him again, and Chu Il-hwan began to feel the side effects of his Demonic Art rising.\n'If the Hall Master weren't here, I'd smash your skull right now.'\nAs murderous intent unconsciously rose within him, causing his right hand to twitch, and just as Chu Il-hwan's gaze shifted to Cha Eun-yeong...\nClang!\nAn unpleasant metallic sound rang out.\nSwoosh!!\nA shuriken shot toward Chu Il-hwan at tremendous speed.\n\"!?\"\nHaving been momentarily distracted, Chu Il-hwan barely managed to block the shuriken.\nAnd he didn't miss it.\n\"Tsk.\"\nThe moment he blocked the shuriken, he caught the Eighth Young Master quietly clicking his tongue.\n\"Hehehe.\"\nFinally understanding the situation, Chu Il-hwan let out a quiet laugh touched with madness.\n'So this is how you want to play?'\nThe Eighth Young Master wasn't hiding his skills. He was merely pretending to struggle.\nThe reason for doing such acting was.\nClang!\nTo send the hidden weapons Baek Cheon threw towards him, just like now.\n‘Revenge, is it?’\nUnderstanding Il-mok's intention, Chu Il-hwan felt more amused than angry.\n'I thought he was a genius, but I didn't expect this.'\nIn the midst of a martial arts match with a senior disciple—and not just any senior, but Baek Cheon, the top student of the second year’s Upper Class—he was accurately gauging Chu Il-hwan's position and altering the trajectory of Baek Cheon's projectiles.\nMoreover...\nSwoosh!\nWhen Baek Cheon's projectile collided with Il-mok's sword, it actually accelerated toward Chu Il-hwan.\nThis defied common sense. When a projectile collides with a sword, the repulsive force should naturally reduce its speed and power.\nYet, the Eighth Young Master was using the principle of fluidity to alter the projectile's path at the moment of impact and even pushing the projectile with his sword at the last moment to accelerate it.\nAnd he was doing this during an intense martial arts match while precisely targeting the moments when Chu Il-hwan was distracted.\nThough he could have been annoyed at being targeted this way, Chu Il-hwan found it amusing instead.\n'Hehehe. The disciple has set up such an entertaining game; I can't possibly spoil it.'\nHaving come up with a good idea, Chu Il-hwan approached Cha Eun-yeong, who had been provoking him.\nWith his back to the ongoing match, Chu Il-hwan glared at Cha Eun-yeong and retorted, \"What were you saying earlier?\"\n\"Hmph. You should separate public and private matters. The Hall Master and Vice Hall Master are watching.\"\nIn response to Cha Eun-yeong's sarcastic remark, Chu Il-hwan outwardly displayed anger while inwardly using his energy sense to carefully monitor what was happening behind him.\n\"You think I'll hold back just because they're here?\"\n\"Just move aside, would you? I can't see the match.\"\nAs he was about to respond to her...\nIl-mok, seeing an opportunity with Chu Il-hwan's back turned, applied the Floral Substitution to a shuriken thrown by Baek Cheon and sent it straight towards the back of Chu Il-hwan's head.\n\"Hmph. It's because you're so short...\"\nChu Il-hwan, who was retorting to Cha Eun-young, suddenly ducked sharply the moment Il-mok's redirected shuriken neared the back of his head.\nWhoosh!\nHe dodged the shuriken with impeccable timing.\nCha Eun-young, whose attention had been fixed on Chu Il-hwan, only noticed the shuriken flying towards her face when her view cleared, but it was too late.\n\"Eek!?\"\nStartled, she let out a strange shriek and hurriedly swung her arm.\nBefitting her position as an instructor of the Hall of the Demonic Way, she managed to deflect the shuriken despite the unexpected attack.\n\"Hahahahaha! D-Did you just squeal 'eek'? Kuhehe.\"\nChu Il-hwan, already bent at the waist, grabbed his stomach and burst into laughter, causing Cha Eun-yeong’s face to turn bright red with embarrassment.\nJust then, a telepathic message from the Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi reached both instructors' ears.\n—The students are watching. Show some restraint.\nFollowing the Hall Master's instruction, both instructors quickly straightened themselves and looked back at the arena.\nPfft.\nHearing Chu Il-hwan's snicker from beside her, Cha Eun-yeong finally lost her temper.\n\"Disciple Baek!!! How long are you going to let your junior play you for a fool?!\"\nHearing the female instructor's shout from behind, Il-mok looked back and clicked his tongue.\n'Tsk. Caught already?'\nChu Il-hwan was grinning playfully while the female instructor beside him had a flushed face.\nIt seemed there was no point in targeting Chu Il-hwan anymore.\nTurning his attention back to the front, Il-mok thought, 'Looks like he's caught on too.'\nWas it because he had been scolded in public during the match? Baek Cheon, who had maintained a relaxed and dignified attitude until now, had a face contorted with rage.\n\"How dare you humiliate me like this?! You truly wish to die, don't you?\"\nEven his manner of speech changed.\n\"I'll kill you!!\"\nAs if forgetting this was merely a martial arts match, Baek Cheon let out a murderous cry and threw more projectiles.\n\"Tsk.\"\nRealizing it was too late to target Chu Il-hwan, Il-mok moved boldly.\nPat!\nClosing in on Baek Cheon by the shortest route, he deflected the thrown projectiles with minimal movement several times.\n\"Oh? You blocked that? Try blocking this!\"\nSeeing Il-mok rapidly approaching, Baek Cheon swung the fan in his right hand.\nThe internal energy condensed on that fan sliced through the air like a sharp blade, flying toward Il-mok.\nClang!\nIl-mok easily deflected that fan energy with a sword energy he created, and as he stepped forward one more time...\nPat.\n\"Kuhehe. Now die!\"\nFrom the folded part of the fan pointed at Il-mok's face, iron needles suddenly popped out.\n'What the fuck!?'\nNot expecting hidden weapons to be concealed in the fan, Il-mok desperately twisted his body to avoid getting his head pierced.\nThanks to his extremely heightened concentration, Il-mok saw the iron needle passing by his nose in slow motion.\n'Whew. I almost died for real.'\nTo think he would resort to such underhanded methods in a martial arts match, not even a real-life-or-death duel.\nAs Il-mok breathed a sigh of relief after narrowly escaping death...\n\"Damn you! How dare you dodge my attack! Just die already!\" Read full story at novèlfire.net\nBaek Cheon, who had retreated again, continued to hurl insults and throw projectiles.\n'...Is this why he was called a troublemaker?'\nWith his mask removed, Baek Cheon was displaying verbal skills that surpassed even the rowdiest street thugs.",

    "content": "Chapter 78: Martial Arts Competition (3)\n\"Die! Just die already, you bastard!!\"\nThe second-year disciples watched with complicated expressions as Baek Cheon hurled daggers while cursing madly in the center of the training ground.\n\"It's been a while since we've seen this side of him.\"\n\"You're telling me. Wasn't this a common sight when he first entered the academy?\" The rıghtful source is NoveI[F]ire.net\n\"Yeah. It was a sight I never wanted to see again.\"\nIt was a sight that was fairly familiar to them. Baek Cheon in the early days of entering the Hall was literally a human who personified the word arrogance.\nThey thought he'd changed a bit now, but it seemed his true nature hadn't gone anywhere.\nMeanwhile, Il-mok, who was in the midst of combat with this scoundrel, charged at Baek Cheon with a grimace on his face.\nIl-mok was also slightly high on blood pressure.\nIt wasn't because of the filthy curses spewing from Baek Cheon's mouth. When it came to verbal abuse, he'd developed a certain immunity after dealing with countless angry citizens during his previous life as a civil servant.\nThe problem was...\n\"I almost died, you fucking bastard!!\"\nIt was the steel needle that had shot out from that fan earlier.\nNo matter how he looked at it, that was clearly a technique meant to kill him.\nIf not for the extraordinary reflexes of Il-mok's body, and if he hadn't received training that bordered on abuse from the Heavenly Demon, he probably wouldn't have even been able to react and would have had a hole drilled in his head.\n\"How dare you!! Do you think you can call me a bastard and get away with it?!\"\nWith his eyes gone wild, Baek Cheon shouted again and swung his arms frantically through the air.\nClang!\nClang! Clang!\nHaving almost died once, Il-mok's eyes were equally crazed as he deflected those hidden weapons with a precisely measured swordsmanship.\nThen, the moment his sword met the final incoming shuriken, he unleashed the Flower Substitution.\nBut this time, he wasn't aiming for Chu Il-hwan.\nThe instant the shuriken seemed to stick to the flat of his blade, Il-mok spun his body as if performing a sword dance, channeling the rotational force to send the shuriken straight back at Baek Cheon.\n\"!?\"\nEven in his enraged state, Baek Cheon was momentarily surprised by this near-miraculous technique.\n\"Eeeek!!!\"\nBut rather than acknowledging his surprise, his wounded pride made him grit his teeth and deflect the shuriken with his fan.\nClang!\nAnd in the instant Baekcheon deflected the shuriken...\nSwaaaash!\nA series of slashes imbued with Sword Qi flew toward Baek Cheon.\n\"You son of a bitch!!\"\nBaek Cheon, now having even forgotten the fact that Il-mok was the Heavenly Demon's disciple, spat out even insane curses and deflected that Sword Qi with his fan.\n\"If I'm a son of a bitch, does that make my Master a dog, you fucking trash?!?”\nWhile Baek Cheon was tied up dealing with the Sword Qi, Il-mok instantly closed the distance, roaring as he swung his sword again.\nHaving successfully closed the distance, Il-mok pressed Baek Cheon with a series of concise sword techniques, while Baek Cheon somehow managed to hold his ground using fan techniques and footwork.\nClang!\nClang!!\nThe sound of metal echoing in succession and the sublime spectacle of martial arts unfolding in the center of the training grounds.\nIt was an extraordinary display of skill that should evoke awe from their fellow disciples, yet...\n\"Hmph.\"\n\"Th-, that bastard is finally.\"\nThe observing disciples were all shaking their heads at the curses being exchanged between Baek Cheon and Il-mok.\nMeanwhile...\n\"Damn it all!!\"\nContinuously being pushed back, Baek Cheon let out a curse born of frustration, then threw himself down and rolled across the ground.\nThe Lazy Donkey Roll\nSome martial artists considered it the most disgraceful technique, even expressing that it was better to die than to deploy the Lazy Donkey Roll.\nBut the pettiness of Baek Cheon, who had revealed his true colors, didn't end there.\nPat!!\nAs if rolling on the ground was meant to gain momentum, Baek Cheon, who had secretly grabbed sand from the ground while rolling, threw it directly at Il-mok who was chasing after him.\nIn the process, he used his hidden weapon technique to infuse the sand with internal energy.\n\"Haaah!\"\nOn top of that, he pulled out more hidden weapons from his clothes and threw them, but...\n\"I knew you'd do this.\"\nIl-mok, who had felt an ominous premonition since Baek Cheon rolled on the floor, was already prepared.\nInternal energy from Il-mok's left palm resting on his sword.\nPat!\nAs Il-mok swung the sword wide to his right, the energy starting from his left palm spread along the sword, forming a thin Qi membrane.\nThe Twelfth Form of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword—Soul Prison Veil (魂獄緞).\nIl-mok didn't stop there.\nThe moment the sand Baek Cheon scattered came into contact with the thin gi membrane, Il-mok's left palm and the sword in his right hand began to dance fluidly.\nThe sword and the palm. The Soul-Guiding Sword was deployed by utilizing the thin Qi membrane on top of that.\nFollowing the principle of fluidity, the Qi membrane moved smoothly to wrap around not only the sand Baek Cheon had thrown but also the hidden weapons that followed.\nPat!\nThen it was swung forcefully in a particular direction.\nSwaaaash!\nThe sand and hidden weapons, now bundled together and carrying a fierce energy, flew at an incredible speed toward Chu Il-hwan.\n\"!?\"\nWhile Chu Il-hwan deflected those bundles with his Black Thunder Demonic Palm with an expression of disbelief...\nPat!\nIl-mok had already closed in right before Baek Cheon's face.\nBaek Cheon, who hadn't been able to rise properly as he had hurriedly thrown sand and hidden weapons while rolling on the ground, tried to move quickly, but...\nSmirk.\nWith a cruel smile at the corner of his lips, Il-mok's sword decisively flew toward Baek Cheon.\nThwack!!\nIn the midst of it all, he kindly rotated his sword and struck Baek Cheon's face with the flat of the blade.\n\"Kuh....\"\n\"Where do you think you're going? Keep rolling like the son of a bitch you are!\"\nIl-mok swung his sword relentlessly as if he'd caught his prey.\nEven while being beaten, Baek Cheon tried to resist by swinging his fan or twisting his body this way and that, but...\nWhoosh!\nThwack!\nIl-mok's sword, infused with various principles, deflected Baek Cheon's fan and showed bizarre trajectories as it repeatedly battered Baek Cheon's body.\n“They say a club has always been the best medicine for dogs!\"\nWith his eyes gone wild from the near-death experience, Il-mok truly swung his sword with no intention to stop.\n\"Stop!\"\n\"Enough! The match is over!\"\nThe instructors belatedly rushed over to restrain Il-mok by grabbing his arms and legs.\nAnd Il-mok, held by the instructors, spoke to them with a desperate expression.\n\"P-please let me go. I, I need to swing my sword.\"\n\"...Stop it. Disciple Baek has already lost consciousness.\"\n\"But....\"\n\"Ahem.\"\nWhen the instructors wouldn't release him, Il-mok struggled with his whole body and yelled.\n\"Because of that bastard, I got another damn enlightenment!\"\nHearing Il-mok's desperate cry, the instructors holding him and the disciples watching all had similar thoughts.\n'...If he's had an enlightenment, isn't that a good thing?'\n'Why is he beating up the one who gave him enlightenment?'\n'Now that I see him, he's a real madman.'\n'I would have never thought that I’d see anyone worse than Baek Cheon in my life.'\nThey were all looking at Il-mok like he was a lunatic.\nContrary to the initial intention, the martial arts competition ended somewhat chaotically.\nIl-mok ran to the clearing he shared with Jeong Hyeon and began swinging his sword like a madman.\nBecause the damn enlightenment brought on by Baek Cheon had triggered his compulsion.\nThe trigger point likely seemed to be the last test. His compulsion had flared up because of Bang Mi-hwa then, leading him to lose himself in a sword dance once already. And with the compulsion not having subsided completely, his reckless use of the Soul-Guiding Sword to get back at Chu Il-hwan was undoubtedly a bad move that aggravated his condition. And with Baek Cheon's action as the catalyst, it’s only a matter of time before his side effects reared their ugly head.\nThanks to those combined factors, his concentration peaked and he succeeded in performing the Soul Prison Veil and Soul-Guiding Sword together.\n'Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. I thought that as long as I completed all the first fourteen forms, I wouldn’t get another enlightenment!'\nIt seemed there was still enlightenment to be gained from the first fourteen forms alone.\nIl-mok swung his sword like a madman.\nWhat he was focusing on now was the principle of fluidity.\nHis enlightenment was trying to mix the principle of fluidity even among the first fourteen forms of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword that didn’t contain that principle.\nHe incorporated the principle of fluidity even when executing strong sword techniques or swift sword techniques.\nHis sword moved gracefully as if carrying a mysterious intent.\nIf someone were to see him, they might think he was a direct disciple of the Wudang Sect rather than the Heavenly Demon’s youngest disciple.\nWhen all of his internal energy was depleted from ceaselessly dancing with his sword, he would sit cross-legged as he was and enter meditation.\nBut meditating didn't mean resting.\nEven while he was circulating his internal energy to his dantian during meditation, he continued to internalize his enlightenment by practicing the sword dance in the depths of his mind.\nAnd after his dantian was filled, he would rise again and perform the sword dance to embody the enlightenment he had achieved during meditation.\nHow long did he dance with his sword like that?\n\"Huff... Huff...\"\nHis breath tasted metallic, and every muscle in his body was screaming. His dantian dried up again...\n\"I-it's over....\"\nFinally freed from the compulsion, Il-mok wanted nothing more than to collapse and sleep.\nBut he simply couldn't.\n\"D-damn hygiene compulsion.\"\nThe thought of sleeping with his whole body soaked in sweat made goosebumps rise all over his body.\nThe next morning.\nIt was the usual martial arts training time with Instructor Chu Il-hwan.\nBut before starting the training, Instructor Chu Il-hwan, with an uncharacteristically solemn face, opened his mouth.\n\"Disciple Il-mok.\"\n\"Yes, Instructor.\"\n\"Congratulations. The Hall Master has highly regarded your talent and said he will make time for you separately.\"\n\"Thank you!\"\n\"Hahaha. What are you thanking me for? It's the Hall Master's choice. I had nothing to do with it.\"\nWhile Il-mok showed a face full of gratitude, inside, he was cursing.\nNot at Chu Il-hwan.\n'Fuck! If I receive special training from the Hall Master on top of this, my body really won't be able to handle it!'\nReceiving special training from the Hall Master while enlightenment had already struck?\nHe might become an actual madman at this rate.\n'Need... need an excuse! Some reason to refuse, somehow!!'\nUnaware of Il-mok's inner thoughts, Chu Il-hwan, still uncharacteristically solemn, pointed somewhere with his hand.\n\"He should be waiting in his residence, so go see him right now.\"\n\"Understood!\"\nIl-mok replied spiritedly, but felt like he was being dragged to a slaughterhouse.\n'What excuse can I make? Fuck! Think, brain, think!'\nBy the time he stopped in front of the Hall Master’s residence, his brain was still unable to come up with a suitable excuse.\n\"Come in.\"\nSensing Il-mok's presence, Yeom Ga-hwi's voice came from inside the residence.\n‘Fuck.’\nCursing inside once more, Il-mok managed his expression and entered the residence.\n\"Welcome.\"\n\"Il-mok, a disciple of the Hall of the Demonic Way, greets the Hall Master.\"\nAs Il-mok saluted and pondered what to say, the Hall Master spoke first.\n\"The reason I called you specifically to my residence rather than the training grounds is that I have a few things to ask before we begin training.\"\n\"Please ask.\"\nWondering what he wanted to ask, Il-mok froze momentarily at Yeom Gahwi's question.\n\"Why did you show such an attitude at the beginning of your match with Disciple Baek Cheon?\"\nYeom Ga-hwi, one of the top masters in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, had naturally noticed Il-mok's antics.\nHe knew that Il-mok, despite pretending to struggle, hadn't really taken Baek Cheon seriously at all.\nNaturally, Il-mok's gaze turned to the Hall Master’s hands, which were clasped together and resting on the table.\n'If I just say I did it because Instructor Chu Il-hwan pissed me off, those fists will probably come flying, right?'\nIt was terrible in many ways.\nGetting his head smashed by those fists would be terrible, and getting another enlightenment while trying to fight back to survive would also be terrible.\nIn Il-mok's head, the topic of 'excuse to refuse the Hall Master's special lesson' was quickly buried.\nTo avoid death, he had to come up with an excuse for that match.\nAnd sure enough, because he sensed a life-threatening situation, his mind worked faster than usual.\n'Ah! That's it!'\nWith his thoughts organized, Il-mok opened his mouth with a solemn face.\n\"It was for my fellow disciples.\"\nIl-mok had decided to throw his peers under the bus.",

    "content": "Chapter 79: Scoundrel (1)\n\"Fellow disciples?\"\nThe Hall Master rubbed his interlocked fingers resting on the table as he asked.\nMy gaze kept drifting towards those heavy, menacing hands, but I barely managed to maintain a serious expression as I replied.\n\"Yes. The seniors defeated everyone except me, so the morale among my peers was extremely low.\"\nI was able to come up with this excuse because of how my classmates acted before my spar. Those lunatics are suddenly cheering for me even though we aren’t close.\nThe Hall Master must have witnessed that scene too.\nAs expected, my words seemed to work as the Hall Master showed interest.\n\"You're saying you deliberately adopted that attitude during the spar to boost your fellow disciples’ morale?”\n“As the ‘representative’ of my class, it is my duty to boost their morale.”\n\"Hmm...\"\nThe Hall Master sighed with complex emotions. As I watched him, a unique idea struck me.\n'Wait, what if I use this to my advantage?'\nIt was the moment a solution to a very important problem for me came to mind.\nSince the Hall Master seemed mentally preoccupied, now was the perfect opportunity.\nWithout hesitation, I spoke up.\n\"Also, the reason I came to see you, Hall Master, wasn't to receive training.\"\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\"I came to decline your offer.\"\n\"...You're refusing my teachings?\"\nWhen the Hall Master’s fist twitched again, I almost flinched without realizing it.\nIt felt like the fists of the man once called the Fist Demon were about to fly.\n'When there is a crisis, there is an opportunity.'\nEven while my brain was blaring alarms in my head, I gathered my courage and said, \"Hall Master. I'm already receiving plenty of teachings just for being my Master's disciple. If I receive special treatment from you as well, there's a risk of creating discord.\"\n“Nonsense. Your skill was already proven before everyone during the match. No one will be able to say a word.\"\n\"They might not show it outwardly, but there will certainly be those who harbor such thoughts inside. I don't want discord among my fellow disciples, so please give your teachings to another disciple instead of me.\"\nIt wasn't rejecting the teachings, but rather giving them to other disciples.\nThat was the excuse I dramatically came up with.\n'If I avoid the teachings, I should be able to avoid enlightenment too. On top of that, I’ll look good with the image of caring for my fellow disciples. Fantastic!’\nWhile I was mentally congratulating myself on my cleverness, the Hall Master sent me a sharp gaze as if to pierce through my mind and spoke.\n\"Very well. Then let me ask you a few more questions.\"\n\"Please do.\"\n“If you adopted that attitude in the match with your fellow disciples in mind, why exactly did you target Instructor Chu Il-hwan?”\nI was momentarily speechless but quickly came up with an excuse.\n\"Because if I deflected those hidden weapons toward the disciples, it could be dangerous. But I believed Instructor Chu Il-hwan would be able to block it properly.\"\n“Oh? It seems the disciples’ trust in Instructor Chu is quite deep.”\n\"My skills have improved tremendously thanks to his teachings.\"\nI managed to praise that perverted instructor without showing any disgust, though the mere thought of him still made my skin crawl.\n\"Good. Then, let's move on from that issue. Now, you said you humiliated Disciple Baek Cheon for the sake of your fellow disciples. But broadly speaking, Disciple Baek Cheon is also your fellow disciple, so why did you commit such a disrespectful act to him?\"\n\"...I was planning to apologize to him separately after the match. Though I would personally apologize for my rudeness, my decision at that time won’t change. Because I’m everyone’s hope, and I needed to fulfill their wishes as their representative.\"\n\"You were planning to apologize... Is that thought still unchanged?\"\n\"Yes, it is.\"\n\"Good. Then let me ask you one final question.\"\nThe continuous questioning made maintaining my string of lies quite difficult.\n'This isn’t the twenty questions game. Cut it out already!'\nAs expected.\nI suspected it from the first day, but the Hall Master is an even worse old fogey than my own Master.\nAnd the final question the Hall Master asked was something I hadn't expected at all.\n\"Disciple Baek Cheon said things that shouldn't have been said during the match with you. What kind of punishment do you think should be given?\"\nFor a moment, I couldn't understand what he was talking about.\nOnly after thinking for a while was I able to understand the meaning of those words.\n'Ah. He's referring to when he called me a son of a bitch.'\nIf I'm a son of a bitch, then my parents are dogs.\nOf course, my parents had passed away, so it was indeed a terribly disrespectful insult, but that wasn't really what mattered now.\nMy personality had only awakened after my parents' deaths, so I didn't really see them as 'parents' anyway.\nThe real problem lay elsewhere.\nIn this world, the saying of “A teacher a day, a father for life” isn’t just empty rhetoric. Insulting me as a son of a bitch is the same as saying my Master is a dog.\nIt required a logical leap and over-interpretation, but considering my Master is the Heavenly Demon, it became an obvious conclusion.\nA believer of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult had called a being revered as a god by the same cult a dog.\nConsidering the thought process of these lunatics, it didn't seem like it would end with just any ordinary punishment.\n\"Before I share my thoughts, may I ask you just one thing?”\n\"Ask.\"\n\"What punishment are you considering, Hall Master?\"\n\"Since he dared to utter an unspeakable insult against the Heavenly Demon, we should cripple his martial arts, sever his limbs, and feed him to wild beasts.”\n\".......\"\nI almost spat out \"Are you insane?\" without realizing it.\nSuch a punishment for just saying \"son of a bitch\" once seemed excessive by any standard.\n‘Even though that guy tried to kill me, I was the one who provoked him in the first place. Of course, seeing him try to kill me just because he got mad proves he's a son of a bitch, and thinking about how I even got enlightenment because of him still pisses me off, but...’\nSevering his limbs and feeding him to wild beasts felt like overkill.\n‘Yeah. Even though I'm pissed, beating him like a dog in front of everyone did let off some steam.’\nAs someone from modern times, I don't want to share the same mindset as these fanatical cult lunatics.\n\"I think that punishment is excessive.\"\nThe Hall Master frowned at my response and asked, \"Even though he spoke unspeakable words against the Heavenly Demon?\"\n“Baek Cheon was cursing at me in the first place. And since all disciples are equal in the Hall, something like this was bound to happen.”\n\"However, the insult directed at you also included the Supreme One.\" Thıs text ıs hosted at n0velfire.net\n“It happened because I provoked Disciple Baekcheon first. Of course, I didn't expect Cadet Baekcheon to lose his temper to that extent, but I believe it was a simple mistake rather than harboring any irreverent intent towards Master.”\n\"Hmm. Then, what kind of punishment do you think is appropriate?\"\n\"...I think he needs stern discipline to learn from this mistake, ensuring he won't make such a slip of the tongue again.\"\n\"Oh? You mean to cut out his tongue.\"\n\"!?\"\nWhy the fuck do these zealots always think this way?!\nI thought I had adapted, but they kept exceeding my imagination every time.\nSensing that Baek Cheon might become mute if things continued this way, I hastily spoke, \"Rather, how about this approach?\"\nShortly after Il-mok left the Hall Master's quarters.\nInstructor Chu Il-hwan, having finished his teaching duties, visited the Hall Master’s residence.\n\"Disciple Il-mok returned earlier than scheduled. Did the training end quickly?\"\nWhen Chu Il-hwan asked with a puzzled expression, Yeom Ga-hwi responded with an uncharacteristic chuckle.\n\"He said he's rejecting my teachings.\"\n\"!?\"\nWhile Chu Il-hwan wore an utterly uncomprehending expression, Yeom Ga-hwi reflected on the conversation he'd just had with Il-mok.\n\"The Young Master has a mind as vast as his talent.\"\n\"???\"\nLooking at Chuu Il-hwan’s bewildered face, the Hall Master held back his next words.\n‘No, perhaps it’s because his talent is so great that his mind is like this.’\nTo deliberately mock the opponent for the sake of his classmates and to even throw away this kind of opportunity for the sake of his classmates.\nHe was confident that he would still occupy the top seat even if he gave up this opportunity.\nFurthermore, he even forgave Baek Cheon who had tried to kill him.\nOf course, Il-mok had proposed his own disciplinary measure to Yeom Ga-hwi, but in his eyes, it felt less like punishment and more like magnanimity aimed at inducing repentance.\nOriginally, Yeom Ga-hwi had no interest in Il-mok.\nAs the Hall Master of the illustrious institute responsible for nurturing the future of the Divine Cult, he needed to be fair and impartial.\nAs the young master had mentioned, giving him special attention when he had already received excessive attention for being the Heavenly Demon's disciple would be very risky.\nBut.\n'Hmm. I'm quite curious to see how much he'll develop during his time at this institute.'\nDue to this conversation, Yeom Ga-hwi found his interest in Il-mok growing steadily.\nThat afternoon.\nAs usual, Il-mok headed to the cafeteria as soon as he finished his daily routine of cleaning his body.\n\"Young Master!!\"\n\"Young Master Il-mok!\"\nAnd as soon as he arrived at the dining hall, Bang Mi-hwa and Dokgo Pae rushed over.\n'Ugh.'\nIl-mok's expression soured. Not because of Bang Mi-hwa's face.\nEven now, she was covering the left side of her jaw with a fan, emphasizing only the right side of her face.\nThe problem was the strong smell of sweat emanating from both of them.\nDokgo Pae was one thing, but Bang Mi-hwa had always bathed after training before having dinner.\nThat was why Il-mok had been eating with her every time, but for some reason, the smell of sweat was wafting from her today as well.\n'Did she get called by Instructor Chu Il-hwan at the end? Is that why she couldn't bathe?'\nWhile Il-mok recalled what had happened hours ago, Bang Mi-hwa and Dokgo Pae began to speak.\n\"I heard the story from the Instructor. You gave up a precious opportunity for my sake?\"\n\"I heard about it too. To give up such a precious opportunity for us. I've misunderstood you all this time, Young Master.\"\nThanks to their alternating explanations, Il-mok could understand what had happened.\n'So Instructor Chu Il-hwan called them for that reason? It seems they'll be receiving the Hall Master’s teaching instead of me.'\nOf course, it didn't matter to him either way.\nHe didn't know what Instructor Chu Il-hwan had told them, but it wasn't something he had done for them. It was just to avoid enlightenment.\n'More importantly, I wish they'd go away.'\nIl-mok frowned and turned his head away from the strong smell of sweat emanating from the two who had approached with touched expressions.\n\"Hohoho. It's okay to be shy, Young Master.\"\n“That’s right! I’ll hone my skills to become a worthy rival for you!\"\nThe two kept spouting nonsense. And Bang Mi-hwa didn't stop there and spat out the words Il-mok had been waiting for.\n\"This incident has made your feelings very clear to me. Since I've received a great favor from you, I have to give you a reward as well. I'll grant you one wish, so just tell me anything.\"\nAt her offer, Il-mok's eyes lit up as he said, \"In that case, please go and wash up.\"\nBecause the smell was terrible.\nStill, since he was addressing a woman, Il-mok deliberately held back his additional thoughts.\nAnd for some reason, Bang Mi-hwa's face slightly reddened as she fanned herself.\n\"My, Young Master is bolder and naughtier than he looks. Hohoho.\"\nThe rhythmically swaying fan caused her facial asymmetry to alternately appear and disappear, and the strong smell of sweat wafted over on the breeze from the fan.\n'Ugh. Is this some kind of mental attack?'\nIl-mok, whose compulsions had worsened because of enlightenment, couldn't help but turn his head away quickly.\n\"Hohoho. Your shy side is cute too. Well then, wait for me. I'll go wash up.\"\nWith those words, Bang Mi-hwa departed with light footsteps.\nIl-mok, having escaped her mental attack, entered the cafeteria without delay.\n\"...Should I go wash up too?\"\nOnly Dokgo Pae remained while muttering incomprehensibly to himself.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 80",
    "content": "Chapter 80: Scoundrel (2)\nAfter quickly finishing his meal, Il-mok left the dining hall. It felt like if he lingered, more lunatics would inevitably come his way.\nAs usual, he headed towards the secluded clearing.\n\"Huu. Huu.\"\nAs Il-mok crossed the training grounds, he heard someone's rough breathing.\nThe sky over the mountainside glowed as the sun began to set.\nBeneath the crimson sky, a lone figure walked across the training ground.\nThud.\nHe collapsed to the ground as if prostrating himself, then rose to his feet again.\nAfter walking a few more steps, he collapsed and prostrated himself again, repeating this pattern.\nIl-mok knew who it was.\nThat's because the reason that man was receiving such a punishment was because of Il-mok.\nIt was Baek Cheon.\nHe was paying the price for his transgression of calling the Heavenly Demon a “dog.” He was punished to do a punishment called Three Steps, One Bow (三步一拜).\nIn fact, the first thing that came to Il-mok's mind was the punishment he had often seen in the South Korean army.\nThe infamous 'laps around the field in full military gear.'\nBut there was no equivalent of 'full gear' here, and since the people here were fanatical cult members, a more fitting punishment was needed.\nThat would be the only way to persuade the Hall Master.\nSo, what Il-mok came up with after much deliberation was running around the training grounds doing Three Steps, One Bow.\nAdditionally, each time he prostrated himself, he had to recite a passage from the doctrinal texts.\nSo that the scripture and faith would be completely engraved in his mind.\nSo that his faith remains firm even in the face of adversity.\nSo that he would never again make the mistake of disrespecting the Heavenly Demon, even by mistake.\nUsing such justifications, Il-mok had succeeded in persuading the Hall Master.\nAs a result, Baek Cheon continued circling the training grounds.\nWith his internal energy sealed, he has to perform the Three Steps, One Bow repeatedly while relying solely on his physical strength. Each time he did that, he would have to recite a passage from the doctrinal texts.\nHowever, Il-mok didn't think it was his fault.\nIf anything, he thought it was thanks to him.\nAt least this punishment was better than limb amputation and becoming food for wild beasts or having one's tongue cut off.\n‘Though I doubt he sees it that way.’\nLosing his interest in watching Baek Cheon, Il-mok continued on his way.\nShortly after Il-mok left.\nA woman dressed in flowing clothes that seemed out of place in a martial training facility was walking toward the dining hall.\nThe red sunset illuminated her face and clothes, creating a somewhat mystical atmosphere.\nNo, it was more accurate to say she was a woman who believed herself to emanate a mystical aura.\nWith haughty steps, the woman arrived at the dining hall, then froze.\n'...He's not here?'\nIt was because Il-mok, who should have been waiting for her, wasn't there.\nShe had even worn her ultimate killer outfit, the only one she'd deliberately brought when entering the Hall just for this occasion.\nBang Mi-hwa who had meticulously bathed and cleansed herself before coming momentarily froze at this cognitive dissonance.\n\"Hmph.\"\nHowever, she quickly regained her composure and gave a haughty smile.\n\"I suppose he must have been too shy.\"\nAs befitting someone who suffered from narcissistic personality disorder, she promptly accepted the situation in a way that was convenient for her.\nShe had a rough idea of where Il-mok might be.\nHe would probably be hiding in that empty lot.\nBut instead of heading there, Bang Mi-hwa walked with dignified steps toward the Black Dragon Pavilion.\n\"Hehe. Young Master, opportunities don't come just any time. If you come begging with tears later, I might forgive you once.\"\nShe decided that the one who got rejected was Il-mok, not her.\nThe next day. Early morning.\nRising from his bed, Baek Cheon walked toward the dining hall with sunken eyes.\n\"Tsk.\"\nThe sound of someone clicking their tongue upon noticing him pierced his ears.\nUnconsciously, Baek Cheon clenched his fist, but he didn't rush at the peer who had clicked their tongue.\nWhile trying his best to ignore that sound and walk, the sound of his classmates' conversation was heard from behind him.\n\"I can't believe he's still walking around normally after saying such things.\"\n\"Shameless.\"\n\"With such recklessness, I knew he'd cause trouble someday.\"\n\"It's not just about being reckless. He must have had such thoughts in his heart to blurt out those words.\"\nThey deliberately gossiped in a voice that he could hear.\nBaek Cheon gritted his teeth.\nAlthough anger rose to the top of his head, he dared not unleash it on them.\nIt wasn't because his internal energy was sealed.\nHe is a direct descendant of the Baek Family. One of the five major families in the Divine Cult. From childhood, he had been hearing the cult’s doctrine so much that his ears got calloused from hearing it so much. But his faith was genuine nonetheless.\nHe was aware that he had committed an unspeakable grave sin.\nHe knew that attacking them at this moment would be tantamount to denying his sin. This is why he endured their contemptuous words.\nForcing down the humiliation, Baek Cheon finished his breakfast and headed alone to the training ground.\nAnd just like yesterday, he continued the Three Steps, One Bow.\nHe had to recite the next passage of the scripture every time he prostrated himself, but it wasn't particularly difficult.\nIt was a scripture that he had heard until his ears were calloused since he was young and had read and read again until it was engraved in his brain.\nLeaving aside whether it resonated in his heart, it was engraved in his brain as it was.\nHe repeated the process wordlessly.\nBefore he knew it, training time had arrived, and he could see his peers and juniors passing by.\nEvery time their gaze turned to him, humiliation surged from the depths of his being even without them saying anything.\nHe had to walk and prostrate himself while becoming a spectacle for them.\nLunchtime passed, afternoon training resumed, dinnertime arrived, and the evening's self-study time began. Still, he walked and bowed endlessly, forced to be a spectacle for those passing by.\nHis stomach, which had not been fed since morning, screamed until he eventually felt nothing.\nHis muscles and joints, deprived of energy, creaked with each movement. His head grew more and more foggy.\nAbout two hours after complete darkness had fallen.\n\"Go back for now.\"\nInstructor Cha Eun-yeong came by and ordered him to rest.\nShe didn’t bother to hide her face that blatantly saying he was pathetic. The proud gaze she had given him until just a few days ago had turned into contempt. Ashamed of that gaze, Baek Cheon barely managed to move his trembling body back to the Black Tiger Pavilion.\nFortunately, his peers had already returned to their rooms.\nTime passed.\nThe same routine was repeated for several days.\nAfter breakfast, he simply walked and prostrated himself endlessly.\nHow many days did he repeat this?\nThe anger and humiliation inside him died. Instead, a different feeling replaces them.\n'Why do I have to keep doing this?'\nIt wasn't defiance.\n'Isn't it all over anyway?'\nGraduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way at the top seat, then solidifying his position in the family… Those ambitions now turned to dust.\nWhat reason was there to endure this punishment? Thɪs chapter is updated by ɴovelfire.net\n\"Go back for now.\"\nToday again, Instructor Cha Eun-yeong dismissed him with the same contemptuous eyes as yesterday’s.\n'Yes. Let's end it all.'\nJust as Baek Cheon, feeling that all this was meaningless, had such a thought.\nSomeone blocked his path.\n\"Eat this before you go in.\"\nIt was the man who caused all of this.\nAfter finishing dinner at the dining hall and offering the rice ball he had prepared in advance to Baek Cheon, Il-mok thought.\n'Tch. Seeing him like that still bothers me.'\nHonestly, just seeing him shouldn't have warranted his attention.\nThe problem was Baek Cheon’s condition kept getting worse with each passing day. His eyes now changed to the look of a dead fish.\n'No matter what, it's a bit too much to only feed him one meal a day and push him around like that.’\nAlthough it was Il-mok himself who had suggested the Three Steps, One Bow punishment, he hadn't expected them to be so brutal about it.\nAfter staring blankly at the rice ball Il-mok offered for a moment, Baek Cheon raised his head and looked at Il-mok's face.\nSoon after, life returned to his dead fish eyes.\nA lively anger at that.\n\"Because of you...\"\nSince he had only eaten one meal a day and spent the whole day performing the punishment, he lacked the strength to shout. Baek Cheon muttered in a raspy, hoarse voice.\nIl-mok chuckled at the malice shown by Baek Cheon.\n\"How is it my fault that this happened because of your shitty personality?\"\nHe felt some sympathy because the punishment seemed excessive compared to what he had done, but he had no intention of accepting the malice directed at him.\nAt Il-mok's pointed remark, Baek Cheon, who had been glaring at Il-mok, laughed deprecatingly.\n\"Fine. It's all my fault. So, I'm going to end it myself instead of receiving such a humiliating punishment.\"\n\"End it yourself? What do you mean?\"\nIl-mok frowned and asked with a sinking feeling.\n\"I mean, I'll kill myself, so leave me alone.\"\nAnd when the answer Il-mok had feared came out of Baek Cheon's mouth, Il-mok burst out with profanity.\n\"Are you crazy? Why are you acting up again when I tried so hard to save you?”\nBaek Cheon's expression turned strange.\n\"Save me? What do you mean?\"\n“You were originally going to have your body dismembered and be fed to wild beasts.”\n\"Don't tell me... You spoke to the Hall Master and changed my punishment?\"\nWhen Il-mok nodded, Baek Cheon's expression crumpled.\n\"Why didn't you just let me die! It's all over for me anyway. Since I got on the Hall Master’s bad side with that mistake, I can't climb to higher places anymore, and my standing in the family will soon fall to the bottom now! What's left for me to live for!?\"\nListening to Baek Cheon's desperate cry, Il-mok thought.\n'Ha. What is this? He's not even a kid.'\nIt was somehow a familiar sight.\nHow should he put it?\nIt felt like watching a high school student who thought college entrance exams were their entire life and committed suicide after failing one test.\n'Ah, seventeen is still a child, I guess.'\nCome to think of it, Baek Cheon was seventeen years old. In modern terms, he'd be at most a high school junior or senior.\n'Damn. Now he just looks even more pitiful.'\nA sigh leaked out unconsciously as the news that would come out right after the college entrance exam came to mind. He had felt sorry for those kids every time he watched the news.\n'They say people don't easily change... but he's still young, so there might be some chance.'\nPeople don't change easily.\nIt was an old adage Il-mok himself had experienced countless times in his life.\nHowever, the most important part of that adage wasn't the phrase \"don't change.\"\nThe adjective \"easily\" was what mattered.\nOccasionally, one or two out of ten people would change when facing a major turning point in their lives.\nSince he had already caused a major incident and reached a turning point, there might be a sliver of possibility for him.\nAfter organizing his thoughts, Il-mok sighed and said. \"First, let's eat and talk.\"\nPat!\nAs soon as he finished speaking, he moved his hand unexpectedly, pressing Baek Cheon's acupoints.\n\"Mmph!?\"\nIl-mok approached the paralyzed Baek Cheon and grabbed his mouth open with one hand and shoved the rice ball in with his other hand.\nThis was Il-mok's way of showing his greatest kindness.\nThat's because.\n'Aish.'\nIt was inevitable that Baek Cheon’s saliva would get on his hand when he shoved down that rice ball.\nMoreover, he had to support Baek Cheon’s exhausted body while doing so.\nFor Il-mok, who suffered from germophobia, this was a grace bestowed at the risk of going mad.\n\"Mmph!?\"\nOf course, from Baek Cheon's perspective, having a rice ball forcibly stuffed into his mouth was anything but.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 81",
    "content": "Chapter 81: Scoundrel (3)\nAfter he’d fed Baek Cheon every last rice ball and poured water down his throat to help him digest, Il-mok washed his hands with the leftover water.\n\"Phew.\"\nOnly then did Il-mok release the pressure points he'd sealed.\nBaek Cheon, whom Il-mok had force-fed, wore a strange expression instead of having a fit.\nHis body, which had been screaming like it was dying, had become a little more comfortable now that some food had entered his stomach.\nHe’d been wondering why he should even bother living just a moment ago, but with a bit of sugar in his system, his mind had calmed.\nFor some reason, Baek Cheon felt utterly ridiculous for the comfort he was now experiencing.\nWhile Baek Cheon was lost in complex emotions, Il-mok finished washing his hands and addressed him.\n\"So, you think dying is better because of one little mistake?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nHearing Baekcheon’s slightly more subdued reply, Il-mok sighed internally.\n\"I don't get it.\"\n“Someone as high-and-mighty as you wouldn’t. You were chosen by the Heavenly Demon; you’ve never known anything but success.\"\n“Can you stop with the bullshit? It’s only been about a year since I became the Master’s disciple.”\n“That’s exactly my point. I’ve heard about what you’ve pulled off in just one year. Things others couldn’t manage in ten, you could pull it off in just one year. How would you know what failure feels like?”\n“Hah. I don’t know what garbage you’ve been listening to, but it sounds like you haven’t heard a thing about what I was doing before I became the Master’s disciple.”\n\"???\"\nBaek Cheon wore a puzzled expression. Indeed, he hadn't heard anything about Il-mok's background before becoming the Heavenly Demon's disciple.\n“My relatives all died when I was thirteen, making me an orphan. It’s all thanks to an innkeeper uncle’s kindness that I could barely survive by working as a waiter for two years.”\n\"!?\"\n\"As if that wasn't enough, the Murim Alliance raided the inn because Master just happened to visit. Even that innkeeper uncle ended up kicking the bucket. It’s only because Master saw something in me that I’m still alive.”\nOf course, it was less ‘seeing something in him’ and more ‘passing some kind of twisted test.’ The man had held a sword to his throat, after all.\nBut bringing that up would be like badmouthing the Heavenly Demon, so Il-mok just glossed over it. He had zero interest in joining this guy in the Three Steps, One Bow punishment.\n\"So by your logic, I should have just died at thirteen since my life was such a failure.”\nBaek Cheon was momentarily speechless.\nHe'd only thought of Il-mok as heaven’s chosen lucky bastard, so he hadn't even imagined that he had lived such an unfortunate life.\n\"In that sense, aren't you luckier than I? Unlike me, who was an orphan and a waiter, you were a direct descendant of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult’s Five Great Families from birth.\"\nTruth be told, Il-mok didn’t really care that he’d been a waiter.\nHis dream was to earn just enough to get by, play around, and relax rather than climb to a high position and suffer from overwork.\nHe was just framing his past to sound unfortunate for Baek Cheon’s benefit.\n\"That's why I really can't understand. As a direct descendant of the Five Great Families, you could live comfortably by doing nothing, so why are you spouting suicidal crap just because of one failure?\"\nIl-mok asked with genuine curiosity.\nIf Il-mok himself had been born into a prestigious family, he would have just trained moderately and taken it easy. That alone would have been enough to live comfortably.\nAfter a moment of silent contemplation, Baek Cheon sighed and opened his mouth.\n“…You’ve probably heard that my nickname before entering the Hall of the Demonic Way was the Baek Family’s good-for-nothing, the scoundrel of my family.”\n“…I did hear something like that right before our match.\"\nWhen the other person switched to formal speech, Il-mok responded in kind. Though he wasn't sure why the conversation had suddenly shifted to the nickname.\n\"Since I was young, I hated having things taken from me more than I feared death itself. It was probably because of my brother. Just because he was born a few years before me, I was constantly compared to him, and the good things always went to my older brother first.\"\n\"Hmm....\"\nIl-mok nodded with a curious sound.\nHe wasn't sure about modern times, but it was quite a common story in this era. Even back in his Seo Ji-hoon days, it was something he’d often seen or heard growing up. The eldest son always came first in the family.\n\"So as a child, I threw tantrums and caused trouble. Begging for attention. Demanding they give me the same things they gave my brother.\"\n\"I see.\"\n\"That habit stuck with me even when I first entered the Hall of the Demonic Way, but my thinking changed a bit as I got older. I realized that such a method could bring immediate benefits, but it was a losing game in the long run.\"\n\"So the solution you came up with was to achieve excellent results at the Hall and gain recognition from your family?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"I see....\"\nIl-mok nodded as if he understood, then delivered his verdict.\n“Your vision is about as broad as a soy sauce dish.”\n\"!?\"\nBaek Cheon's eyes widened in astonishment.\nIgnoring this reaction, Il-mok continued his criticism.\n\"Though he held different views from the Divine Cult, the ancient sage Confucius said he set his mind on learning at fifteen. Yet here you are at seventeen, thinking only about gaining attention from your family elders. How incredibly small-minded is that?”\nFrom the beginning, Il-mok had no intention of comforting or soothing Baek Cheon. He was only trying to knock some sense into the guy’s thick skull.\nIf you always jump to defend someone just because you feel sorry for them, you’ll end up spoiling them rotten. Sometimes, you have to scold them even if you feel bad.\nBesides, this kid wasn’t his , so why should he go out of his way to console him?\n‘Though why I am lecturing someone else’s kid was beyond me.’\nWhile Il-mok was inwardly grumbling, Baek Cheon rose to object. Follow current novᴇls on n0velfire.net\n“Are you calling the approval of my Baek Family, one of the main lineages of the Demonic Path, ‘just’ something trivial?”\n\"I know your family is prominent, but it's still just one family. In the grand scheme of things, it's nothing special. Even without discussing the world at large, just within the Divine Cult, there are four other families of similar standing, not to mention my Master who stands above them all.\"\n\".......\"\nUnable to find a rebuttal, Baek Cheon hesitated, then his face grew gloomy once more.\n\"Then all the more reason I should die. I couldn't even manage the small feat of being recognized in a family. I can't even dream of doing bigger things.\"\n\"Stop talking such dumb crap. Think of Emperor Gaozu of Han. Until the final Battle of Gaixia, he lost almost every single battle to the Hegemon-King of Western Chu, yet in the end, it was Emperor Gaozu of Han who unified the realm. Failures are commonplace when you are pursuing great ambitions. That's because such endeavors are inherently difficult. That’s why the most important thing is an unbreakable spirit, wouldn't you agree?”\n\"!!!\"\nAs if having reached some epiphany, Baek Cheon wore a surprised expression.\nNow that the conversation seemed to be progressing, Il-mok moved beyond shock therapy and offered sincere advice.\n“So, before you go setting grand ambitions, take a good, hard look at yourself first.”\n\"At myself?\"\n\"That's right. If you're going to set a grand ambition, shouldn't you first figure out what you truly want to do? What do you love the most?\"\nIl-mok himself had done some reflection, embraced a grand ambition—to slack off and live comfortably—and was forging ahead with an unbreakable spirit.\nThough constantly hindered by his Master and Jin Hayeon, his spirit remained unbroken.\nIl-mok continued his heartfelt advice.\n\"Let me be blunt. If your family elders told you to die for their recognition, would you do it? Of course not. So, stop worrying about the Baek Cheon that others see and figure out the Baek Cheon that you wanted yourself to be.”\nRegardless of what others said, Il-mok's desire to live comfortably remained unchanged.\nThat was the very core of Il-mok himself.\n\"You'll have to be doing the Three Steps, One Bow for a while anyway, so you’ve got plenty of time on your hands.\"\nEven after Il-mok finished speaking, Baek Cheon remained silent for a while.\nHe wasn't ignoring Il-mok's words. He was simply organizing Il-mok's words in his head with a blank expression.\nAnd having finished organizing things to some extent, Baek Cheon, whose eyes had become clearer, spoke cautiously. \"I understand what Confucius said. But I'm not sure if I can truly make a comeback. Having spoken disrespectfully to the Heavenly Demon, can I ever realize my ambitions?\"\n“Tsk. You still don’t get it. If your ambition is firm, others' opinions don't matter. Besides, I’m the one who heard those insults, and I’ve forgiven you. So why should you care what anyone else thinks?”\n\"!!!\"\nFor a moment, Baek Cheon showed a moved expression at Il-mok's mention of \"forgiveness.\"\nThen, as if curiosity had struck, he asked with an expectant face.\n\"Then, what is your grand ambition?\"\nIl-mok pondered. He knew that answering with something like \"wealthy idler\" would nullify everything he had just said.\nSo after quickly racking his brain, he came up with a decent answer.\n“To personally avenge the old innkeeper who took me in and looked after me for two years. My Master told me that the Leader of the Flying Dragon Unit orchestrated the whole affair.”\n\"Oh....\"\nBaek Cheon looked at Il-mok with a surprised expression again.\nAs a direct descendant of the Baek Family, Baek Cheon knew that the Leader of the Flying Dragon Unit was one of the highest-ranking figures within the Murim Alliance.\nTo kill that Flying Dragon Unit Leader with his own hands…\n“So that’s how you managed to reach such an incredible level in just one year! I can’t even begin to imagine the brutal training you must have endured for the sake of your revenge.”\nIl-mok responded to the praise with an awkward smile.\n'I... I just trained to stay alive?'\nIt was mostly thanks to his ‘kind’ maid threatening to lop his head off if he failed the entrance exam.\nAnd, of course, his equally ‘kind’ Master, who seemed to think Il-mok was some kind of Super Saiyan and kept forcing him into ‘realistic combat spars’ that pushed him to the brink of death, also played a major role.\nBut perhaps taking Il-mok's awkward smile for modesty, Baek Cheon said with a resolute face.\n\"I haven't set my grand ambition yet, but I'll promise you just this one thing. Whatever my ambition becomes, I will help you with your revenge even if that costs my life.\"\n“Ahem. Well, thanks for the thought, anyway.”\n“The thought? Not at all, Young Master! I am absolutely sincere!”\nIl-mok felt goosebumps all over his body as the person before him suddenly changed and shouted earnestly with starry eyes.\n\"Ahem. A-alright, so go back and rest for today. And reflect on yourself while you continue with your punishment.\"\n\"I will do so.\"\n“And make sure you eat properly. If your body falls apart, your mind won’t be far behind.”\nWith those words, Il-mok utilized his lightness skill and left the place.\n\".......\"\nBaek Cheon silently stared in the direction Il-mok had gone with clear eyes for a while.\n\"I won't forget this kindness.\"\nHe suddenly cupped his fist in one hand towards the empty air and returned to the Black Tiger Pavilion.\nEarly the next morning.\nHeading to the dining hall upon waking as usual, Baek Cheon began shoveling large amounts of rice into his mouth, unlike his usual behavior.\nHe needed the energy to endure the punishment he was receiving.\nHe could hear disciples whispering behind him as they watched him pile up his rice bowl, but Baek Cheon didn't care.\n'The opinions of others don't matter.'\nHe was reflecting on the words he had heard from the Young Master last night.\n‘What is it that I really want to do?’\nAs he circled the training ground performing the punishment, only that question occupied his mind.\nOne could say he had successfully turned over a new leaf, just as Il-mok had hoped.\nHowever…\n'That's right. What I truly love isn't recognition from others at all.'\nThere was just one thing Il-mok had overlooked.\n'I never wanted to push aside my brother and become the family head either.'\nThis was the Hall of the Demonic Way, an institution dedicated to cultivating talent for the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. And every talent within its walls practiced Demonic Arts.\nThe side effect of the Hundred Flowers Demonic Art practiced by Baek Cheon, a direct descendant of the Baek Family, was precisely—\n'Attention! I just loved receiving people's attention!'\nAttention-seeking disorder.\n‘The reason I was jealous of my older brother when I was a kid was just because I envied the attention that was going to him!’\nThe Hundred Flowers Demonic Art was exactly as its name suggested, it was an art that bloomed a hundred different flowers using various objects. That made it specialized for assassination techniques.\nIn the Central Plains, the Sichuan Tang Family was also renowned for its hidden weapons, much like the Baek Family. However, unlike the Sichuan Tang Family, which was famous for its use of poison in addition to hidden weapons, the Baek Family didn't handle poison at all .\nThe reason was simple.\nUsing poison wasn't flashy enough.\nThe reason the Baek Family was called the Hundred Shadow Baek Family was also due to the principle of the first family head.\nFlowers are most beautiful at the moment they bloom. Thus, they believed that hiding various hidden weapons and blooming them at once was the true art.\n'Yes. Attention! Attention is the reason for my life and its true value!'\nThe moment Baek Cheon's self-reflection reached that point...\nThe contemptuous gazes and criticisms from around the training ground began to feel entirely different to him.\n'Hehehe. Yes. Look at me.'\nHe had only enjoyed positive attention in the past, but now, all forms of attention pleased him.\n'I will surely change those gazes that look at me like trash. Hehehe.'\nJust imagining turning those negative gazes around sent shivers down Baek Cheon's spine.\n‘Yes! The Young Master told me to dream big! From this moment on, I have only one goal: to become the most famous man in the entire world! A man who commands everyone’s attention!’\nHe didn't know how to achieve that goal yet, but as the Young Master said, what he had now was time to think.\nHe could gradually devise methods as he went along.\n\"Hehehe.\"\nIt was the moment when the Baek Family's troublemaker evolved into a legendary attention-seeker.",

    "content": "Chapter 82: The Greatest Prodigy of the Demonic Way (1)\nLife had been good for Il-mok these past few days.\n\"Hehehe. How peaceful.\"\nBang Mi-hwa and Dokgo Pae had begun receiving special lessons from the Hall Master. Thanks to that, the two of them had barely been around Il-mok recently.\n\"I won't waste this opportunity that the Young Master has graciously given to me! Just you wait! I'll definitely become a worthy rival for you!\"\nIl-mok wasn't entirely sure what kind of thought process he had, but Dokgo Pae had declared this challenge like some sort of revenge vow before immersing himself in training.\nAs for Bang Mi-hwa...\n“Hmph. Opportunities like this don’t come often, Young Master. Well, if you get on your knees and beg for forgiveness, maybe I’ll consider letting it slide… just once.”\nShe’d spouted that weird nonsense and started acting like Il-mok didn’t even exist.\nFrom Il-mok's perspective, this was truly a blessing. They were ignoring him of their own accord.\nTo top it off, Ju Seo-yeon had been throwing herself into her training to become the second-ranked student ever since Il-mok had scolded her.\nAnd Mak Ho-yeol—who Il-mok couldn’t help but think looked suspiciously like Dokgo Pae’s long-lost brother—had caught the eye of Vice Hall Master Yu Geuk and was also receiving special training.\nWith hardly anyone coming to bother him, peace had finally returned to Il-mok's daily life after a very long time.\nThe only slightly annoying things were Instructor Chu Il-hwan, whom he had to face during every class period, and the strange rumors swirling around Baek Cheon.\nApparently, while doing his punishment in the training ground, he’d occasionally flash a creepy smile or burst into mad laughter.\nThe gossip within the Hall of the Demonic Way was that he’d gone completely bonkers while serving his punishment.\nSince Baek Cheon’s strange behavior had started right after their conversation the other night, Il-mok felt a little uneasy.\n'Well, going mad is better than committing suicide, I guess.'\nAfter convincing himself of that, he decided to just ignore it.\n\"Haaah...\"\nAs Il-mok let out a long yawn, Jeong Hyeon, who had been aiming her bow from about ten paces away, flinched and looked toward him.\nShe hesitated for a moment, clearly unsure of what to do. Then, lowered her bow and asked Il-mok cautiously.\n\"Um, young lord...? A-Aren’t you going to… train?”\n\"Rest is also a form of training. Haaah...\"\nSeeing Il-mok's languid face as he answered and yawned again, Jeong Hyeon, who had been fidgeting like a restless puppy carefully said, “I-If you’re uncomfortable… I-I’ll leave, Young Master.”\n“??? What are you even talking about?”\nIt would make sense if Jeong Hyeon felt uncomfortable because of him and wanted to leave, but there was no reason for him to feel uncomfortable because of her.\nSure, he disliked crowds and commotion, but even now, Jeong Hyeon was keeping a good ten-foot distance as they talked.\nAnd she’d barely said a word to him until now, making her pretty much the most comfortable person to be around.\n“Ah. Did I make you uncomfortable? Sorry.”\n“N-No, not at all, Young Master!”\nAt Il-mok's apology, Jeong Hyeon shook her head and waved her hands vigorously.\nAfter pondering for a moment, Jeong Hyeon mustered courage and said, \"Actually, I saw it.\"\n\"...Saw what?\"\n“T-The way you were training after the competition… I happened to come here and… saw you…”\n\"Ah.\"\nIl-mok recalled that incident.\nAn enlightenment had struck him during his spar with Baek Cheon, and he’d practically lost himself in a wild training session right here to integrate that enlightenment into his body.\n\"Ahem. How embarrassing.\"\nWhen Il-mok replied with a sheepish expression, Jeong Hyeon’s internal monologue went something like, Yep, just as I thought.\nJeong Hyeon had seen it that day.\nWhat Il-mok was like when he truly immersed himself in the sword.\nIt was almost deranged—something you wouldn't see unless you were completely obsessed with swords.\nEven when she had approached nearby, Il-mok hadn't noticed her presence and continued swinging his sword endlessly.\nOf course, \"nearby\" was relative in her case.\nEither way, Jeong Hyeon had felt a sense of dissonance since then.\nWhy would someone who loved the sword that much, who was that devoted to his training, only practice stealth techniques when he was around her?\nAnd based on her own experience, Jeong Hyeon concluded.\n‘The Young Master must be surprisingly shy too.’\nHe must be embarrassed to train with his sword in front of other people.\nNot wanting to bother Il-mok, Jeong Hyeon took a deep breath and spoke again.\n“I-If I’m in your way… I’ll leave, Young Master. Please, please train comfortably.\"\nIl-mok thought this was absurd.\n‘I finally get some peace and quiet after ages, and he wants me to train?’\nHe was already dealing with stronger compulsions since his recent enlightenment.\nIf he didn't rest and stabilize his mind a bit, there was no telling when he might explode.\nEspecially with the Hall Master and Vice Hall Master’s special training sessions about to end. If people like Dokgo Pae, Mak Ho-yeol, or Bang Mi-hwa kept clinging to him, he might end up dancing with his sword again.\n'I need to calm my mind at least until then.'\nHe definitely wasn’t slacking off. Absolutely not.\nHis rest had its reasons.\nBut he couldn't very well answer that his mental illness was getting worse.\n\"Not all training involves directly swinging a sword. I was actually meditating, so don't mind me.\"\nIl-mok made up a flimsy excuse.\n\"Me-meditating.\"\nShe clearly remembered seeing him yawning just moments ago.\nShe even recalled seeing him dozing off while seated and snoring yesterday.\nNoting Jeong Hyeon's skeptical attitude, Il-mok shrugged once and said, “It’s called visualization, you should try it, Disciple Jeong. You still seem pretty uncomfortable with people getting close. Try closing your eyes and picturing it. Once you get used to it in your imagination, you’ll find it more manageable in real life.”\n\"Ah!\"\nJeong Hyeon nodded with an impressed expression.\nShe had been wanting to overcome this side effect of fearing people's approach.\n\"Whew.\"\nTaking a deep breath, Jeong Hyeon closed her eyes while standing and sank deep into her mental world.\nIn her mental landscape, she was in the middle of a mountain with no people around, holding a bow and aiming somewhere.\nPop.\nSuddenly, her imagination solidified, and a person appeared twenty feet away.\nIt was Il-mok.\n‘Well, even if it’s just my imagination, it’s probably best to picture someone I’m at least a little comfortable with, right?’\nAnd in her mental world, she released the bowstring aimed at Il-mok.\nClang!\nThe Il-mok in her imagination easily deflected the arrow.\nThough this Il-mok was created in her mental world, she had observed him enough to recreate his wondrous swordsmanship accurately.\nAfter easily deflecting her arrow, Il-mok stepped one step closer.\nIn that interval, Jeong Hyeon pulled her bow taut again and released.\nClang!\nOnce more, Il-mok deflected the arrow and stepped one step closer, and she shot another arrow at him several more times.\nBefore she knew it, he had reached the ten-foot boundary line she unconsciously maintained in her mind.\nClang!\nAs her arrow was deflected again and Il-mok finally crossed that boundary...\n'Eek!'\nJeong Hyeon, who was about to have a panic attack without realizing it, quickly composed herself.\n‘This is just my imagination. I can do anything in my imagination!’\nShe repeated the mantra in her head. She nocked another arrow to her bow, pulling back the string, and staring straight at Il-mok's face as he came closer.\n'Right. Since it’s just my imagination... I can do anything... Can’t I? So… getting closer to the Young Master is okay too…?’\nThe moment that thought crossed her mind.\nStep.\nStep.\nThe Il-mok in her mental world, who had been taking one slow step at a time until now, began boldly approaching her.\n‘Hiiik….’\nFrozen by Il-mok's sudden approach, she realized he was now close enough for her to feel his breath.\n‘Th-This is way too fast, Young Master!?'\nFor what felt like an eternity, she squirmed, flustered and blushing furiously, not knowing what to do.\nThen, belatedly remembering this was all in her head, she opened her eyes.\n\".......\"\nThe face of Jeong Hyeon, who had emerged from her mental world, was just as crimson as it had been in her imagination. Not only that, she was twisting her body in the same bizarre way as in her mental world.\nSeized by sudden fear, she quickly turned her head. Check latest chapters at novᴇlfire.net\nHad Il-mok seen her looking like this?\n\"Zzzzzzzzz.\"\nWhat she saw was Il-mok sitting cross-legged, snoring and dozing off.\nWhile Il-mok was deep in dreamland and Jeong Hyeon was lost in her own strange fantasies…\nOn the other side of the Hall of the Demonic Way, Bang Mi-hwa and Dokgo Pae were engrossed in their training under the watchful eye of Yeom Ga-hwi.\nAfter watching them trade blows with fans and swords for a while, Yeom Ga-hwi finally spoke.\n“You’ve both improved remarkably these past ten days.”\n“It’s all thanks to your guidance, Hall Master.”\n“Thank you, Hall Master.”\nThe two clasped their hands in respectful bows, thanking the Hall Master. Yeom Ga-hwi nodded, then casually mentioned, “You could also say you owe it to Disciple Il-mok for giving you this opportunity.”\n\"That's true, Hall Master.\"\n\"Even now, we're grateful to Disciple Il-mok.\"\nYeom Ga-hwi hid his inner thoughts behind a solemn expression and asked, “Speaking of which… What’s your impression of Disciple Il-mok, as fellow disciples?”\nYeom Ga-hwi had been increasingly intrigued by Il-mok since their last conversation.\nTo Yeom Ga-hwi's question, Dokgo Pae answered first.\n“I think I understand now why the Heavenly Demon chose Disciple Il-mok as his disciple. He is truly worthy of being called the Greatest Prodigy of the Demonic Way. But that doesn't mean I’m giving up! Now that the Hall Master has given us his teachings, I will catch up to Disciple Il-mok!”\nDokgo Pae’s eyes burned with the fire of rivalry.\n\"Hmm.\"\nAnd Yeom Ga-hwi uttered a curious exclamation as he looked at Dokgo Pae.\n‘No need to tell him outright how difficult that will be.’\nThe skill the youngest Eighth Master had displayed at the last sparring assembly was already far beyond what most could achieve at his age.\nMoreover...\nConsidering he’s only been in the cult for a year, the gap is more likely to widen than shrink. Catching him will be a monumental task.’\nBut there was no reason to voice such thoughts. And one never truly knew what the future held. Perhaps this boy could actually manage to catch up to the Young Master.\n“Beyond martial arts, what is your impression of him as a person?”\nYeom Ga-hwi changed the subject smoothly, asking what he really wanted to know in the first place.\nSince he had already witnessed Il-mok's martial prowess at the previous competition, what he was truly curious about was this aspect.\nAt Yeom Ga-hwi's question, Dokgo Pae fell silent.\nHe’d been so focused on Il-mok’s martial arts and seeing him as a rival that he hadn’t paid any attention to anything else about him.\nBang Mi-hwa spoke up instead.\n\"Il-mok is more shy than he appears.\"\n\"...Shy?\"\nYeom Ga-hwi was confused.\nThis description didn't match at all with the image of someone who had confidently presented logical arguments before him, the Hall Master.\nAt Yeom Ga-hwi's query, Bang Mi-hwa answered with her characteristically proud and haughty expression.\n\"Hehe. He struggles even to look directly at the face of the woman he admires. And he seems embarrassed by attention, so he always goes to secluded places when he’s not in training.”\nOut of consideration for the shy Il-mok, she omitted mentioning that she was the woman he admired.\nIf even the Hall Master knew this fact, Il-mok might become even more embarrassed.\nStill, as someone who cared for Il-mok in her own way, she added, \"But I believe he's a man who does what needs to be done when the time comes. Didn't he demonstrate his skills in front of others during the martial arts competition?\"\n\"Hmm....\"\nYeom Ga-hwi let out a faint sigh, his characteristically grave face revealing nothing of his inner thoughts.\n'Shy... That's a regrettable temperament for someone meant for a significant position.'\nHowever, he had no intention of finalizing his judgment of Il-mok based solely on Bang Mi-hwa's account.\nAfter all, he'd only seen two aspects of Il-mok:\nHis prowess in the martial arts competition and his demeanor when confidently refusing Yeom Ga-hwi's teachings while presenting logical arguments.\nFinding that a little contradictory, Yeom Ga-hwi dismissed Bang Mi-hwa and Dokgo-pae and summoned Ch Il-hwan to his residence.\n\"Tell the instructors to write and submit evaluations of the new disciples they've observed.\"\n“Understood, sir.”\nChu Il-hwan didn't express any doubts. It was an order from the Hall Master, and such directives were not uncommon.\nThe following day, dozens of scrolls lay piled on Yeom Ga-hwi’s desk. They are the instructors’ assessments of the twenty disciples.\nAmong them, Yeom Ga-hwi first began reading the evaluations about Il-mok.\nHowever, Yeom Ga-hwi's mind was plunged into even greater confusion after reading them all.\nIt was because Instructor Choo Il-hwan and Instructor Eun Ryeo had given Il-mok the same evaluation.\n—Outstanding talent, but a potential womanizer.\nShy, yet fond of women?\nThe more he heard others' evaluations of Il-mok, the more confused Yeom Ga-hwi became.",

    "content": "Chapter 83: The Greatest Prodigy of the Demonic Way (2)\nA few days later.\nAfter reviewing all the reports on the disciples submitted by Chu Il-hwan and pondering for several more days, Yeom Ga-hwi summoned Chu Il-hwan to his place.\n\"I will personally attend the second test of the new disciples that will be held soon.\"\n\"Understood.\"\nChu Il-hwan showed no particular surprise at Yeom Ga-hwi's announcement.\nHe usually attended tests or training sessions three or four times a year.\nHowever, his purpose wasn't to observe the disciples.\nThe original role of the Hall Master was to monitor the \"instructors,\" not the disciples.\nThe instructors of the Hall of the Demonic Way were all individuals who had mastered Demonic Arts to a certain level, which meant they were all suffering from side effects.\nAlthough they could control themselves to some extent and thus perform their duties as instructors, they were all like ticking time bombs.\nThe Hall Master's role was to keep these instructors in check.\nOf course, if his intention was to monitor the instructors, it would make sense to conduct surprise inspections without prior notice, but Yeom Ga-hwi never acted that way.\nKnown for his straightforward character, he always expressed his intentions in advance before attending.\nIt was precisely because of this personality that Heavenly Demon had appointed him as the Hall Master.\nIn the first place, the role of the Hall Master was more about 'preventing' the instructors from going berserk. Cleaning up after the instructors who caused an accident was merely a byproduct of that.\nUltimately, it meant that it was crucial to make the instructors constantly aware that the Hall Master was watching them, thereby encouraging them to exercise self-restraint.\nIn that sense, Yeom Ga-hwi's straightforward personality was perfectly suited for the position of Hall Master.\nChu Il-hwan, knowing Yeom Ga-hwi's personality, naturally assumed this observation was meant to monitor them, but...\n'Hmm. While checking on the instructors' condition, I need to assess the Eighth Young Master's true character.'\nIn truth, Yeom Ga-hwi's real purpose was to observe Il-mok.\nThe evaluations of Il-mok were so mixed that the Hall Master wanted to see for himself in detail.\n\"There might be a bit of a shortage of manpower for this examination, so I will also take on the role of supervisor alongside the instructors.\"\nIt was to observe Il-mok in detail, but Chu Il-hwan clasped his hands in salute with a moved expression.\n\"I can only express my gratitude for your consideration, Hall Master. This Chu will ensure that no unfortunate incidents occur during this examination.\"\n\"Good. You must be busy with work, so you may go now.\"\nAs Chu Il-hwan left the Hall Master's chamber at Yeom Ga-hwi's dismissal, he thought,\n'They've been doing well enough on their own, but I should still pass along the message to the instructors. That they need to be extra vigilant this time.' Google seaʀᴄh NoveIＦire.net\nOf course, those who ‘need to be vigilant’ included Chu Il-hwan himself.\nThe next morning. It was Instructor Chu Il-hwan's martial arts training session, same as always.\nHowever, instead of immediately beginning the training, Chu Il-hwan gathered the disciples' attention, saying he had an announcement to make.\n\"Five days from now, it will mark two months since you all entered this Hall of the Demonic Way. And as you might have gathered from the last test, the second one will be held in five days.”\nIl-mok, who had been listening to Instructor Chu Il-hwan's words with a disinterested expression, nodded his head.\n'Hmm. It was an exam notice?'\nHe felt indifferent about it.\nSince the last martial arts competition, Il-mok had truly done his best to rest for over twenty days—so much so that he hadn't drawn his sword even once outside of martial arts training hours.\nEven during training, he merely pretended to swing his sword halfheartedly.\n'I'll just get through it and rest again.'\nAs Il-mok was thinking about taking another nap in the training ground today, Instructor Chu Il-hwan continued his explanation.\n\"The reason I'm telling you about the test in advance is because the Hall Master will be observing this test.\"\n\"!!!\"\nThe eyes of the Upper Class disciples listening to Instructor Chu Il-hwan's explanation grew more intense.\nGlancing over those disciples, Instructor Chu Il-hwan added his final words.\n\"Of course, I believe none of you would take the test casually or halfheartedly even if the Hall Master wasn't watching. However, since the Hall Master will be observing, I hope you'll be even more focused. That is all.\"\nFor some reason, as he spoke the words ‘casually or halfheartedly,’ he stared intently at Il-mok.\n'Ahem.'\nIl-mok quickly averted his eyes from that intense gaze. Not because he felt guilty.\n'Damn. He still hasn't given up?'\nIt was because whenever he made eye contact with Chu Il-hwan, goosebumps kept rising on his skin.\nMeanwhile, unlike Chu Il-hwan's focus on Il-mok, others were more stimulated by his words.\n'The Hall Master is observing! He must be here to see me!’\n'Hehe. It seems the Hall Master has taken an interest in my talent as well.’\nDokgo Pae and Bang Mihwa, who had been receiving special training from Yeom Ga-hwi thanks to Il-mok's concession, had similar thoughts.\nThey believed that the reason the Hall Master was coming to observe was to directly verify the results of their special training.\nNaturally, both of them looked toward Il-mok.\n'Hehehe. It won't be so easy this time!'\n'Hohoho. Since the Young Master is too embarrassed to apologize, it wouldn’t be bad for me to make him kneel before me this time!’\nAfter all, to show the results of their special training, they needed to teach the top-ranked Il-mok a lesson.\n'What are those idiots up to now?'\nOf course, from Il-mok's perspective, it just looked like those lunatics were plotting some other crazy stunt.\nAfter announcing the exam, Chu Il-hwan gave an order.\n\"Now begin your training.\"\nAs soon as his order fell, the disciples spread out widely across the training ground and began wielding their weapons, keeping appropriate distances from each other.\nOccasionally, sparring sessions were held under the supervision of Chu Il-hwan and his assistants, but martial arts training sessions had been proceeding in this way for some time.\nAfter observing the first day's duels, Chu Il-hwan would tell each disciple what they needed to correct or improve. Then the disciples would train, keeping those points in mind.\nChu Il-hwan and his assistants would walk around checking on each person's condition, and if someone seemed to be struggling, they would offer guidance through direct sparring.\nThe same had happened after the previous test and martial arts competition. Chu Il-hwan would point out mistakes or flaws shown in the test or competition, and the disciples would reflect on their martial arts accordingly during training.\nIn other words, that's how the others were training.\nExcept for Il-mok.\nWhen Il-mok stared intently at somewhere, the trio there bowed their heads and approached Il-mok.\nThey were the very trio who had picked a fight with Il-mok on the second day and gotten thoroughly beaten up.\nIn particular, Choi Woong, who had passed information about Il-mok to the seniors, felt especially guilty that he even used his lightness skill to approach Il-mok.\nChoi Woong and the trio took positions around Il-mok and began training with their weapons.\nIt was a kind of human barrier. One to shield from the gazes and interest of Chu Il-hwan and other crazy people.\nUsing the three as shields to block others' gazes, Il-mok just swung his sword halfheartedly within that protection.\n\"Hwaaaahm.\"\nComplete with an exaggerated yawn.\nThe five days passed quickly as he spent his days in a lazy manner that would make Jin Hayeon or Heavenly Demon rush to cut off his head if they knew about it.\nThe disciples of the Upper Class and the Lower Class left the main gate of the Hall of the Demonic Way with the instructors just like the last time.\nBut after arriving at the gathering place from the last time, something was different.\n\"Team One: Dokgo Pae, Choi Woong, Kang Taeseok, Gwak Sul, Ju Seo-yeon.\"\nFirst, each team had five members instead of four.\n\"The groups whose names have been called, please come this way.\"\nAnd instead of moving them in groups in advance, they were merely sorting them.\n\"Last team, Team Four: Il-mok, Seong Hwan, Jeong Hyeon, Lee Gyun, Bu Gayeong.\"\nIl-mok quickly scanned the members of his team.\nSeong Hwan was from the Upper Class like Il-mok, and like Choi Woong, he was one of the trio who had picked a fight with Il-mok.\nAnd for some reason, Choi Woong was looking at Seong Hwan with envious eyes.\n'Damn it. I should have been the one on Young Master Il-mok's team.'\nIt was because he got a taste of what Il-mok was capable of during the previous test.\nMoreover...\n\"Hahaha! Everyone just trust your team leader!\"\nLooking at the self-proclaimed team leader Dokgo Pae, who was laughing confidently, he couldn't help but think they were doomed.\nMeanwhile, Il-mok quietly sighed to himself.\n'Did I show off too much in the first test and martial arts competition?'\nOf the five members in Il-mok's team, only he and Seong Hwan were from the Upper Class. The other three, including Jeong Hyeon, were all from the Lower Class.\nIt seemed to be a maneuver to balance the skill levels between teams. Conversely, the First Team, led by Ju Seo-yeon, who ranked at the bottom of the Lower Class, had three Upper Class disciples, including Dokgo Pae.\nNot that he thought they were at a disadvantage. He could easily make up for two or three Upper Class disciples himself.\nIt’s just that...\n'I was planning to take it easy, but... tsk.'\nMaintaining his rank while taking it easy would be somewhat more challenging with this kind of team composition.\nInwardly shaking off his disappointment, Il-mok looked at Jeong Hyeon.\n'At least Instructor Eun Ryeo granted my request.'\nAs Jeong Hyeon had requested the day after the first test, Il-mok had requested Instructor Eun Ryeo to put him and Jeong Hyeon on the same team.\nFortunately, Instructor Eun Ryeo had granted Il-mok's request.\n\"I'm counting on you, Disciple Jeong.\"\nAs Il-mok said this and took a step toward Jeong Hyeon...\n\"I-I-I look forward to working with you.\"\nFor some reason, Jeong Hyeon trembled and retreated further than the distance Il-mok had approached.\n\"Eek!\"\nThen, belatedly realizing she had gotten close to another teammate, she let out another strange shriek.\n'Young Master is a liar!'\nAfter following Il-mok's advice and doing the mental training, it had become even more difficult for her to get close to him.\nJust getting a little closer made her remember what happened in that mental world, causing her face to flush and her whole body to twist uncomfortably.\nSeeing Jeong Hyeon looking like he might have a seizure at any moment, the rest of the team thought.\n'Seems like we got stuck with a bad team...'\n'One member is practically useless.'\n'Still, with the Eighth Young Master here, there might be a glimmer of hope.'\nWhile they were lost in their own thoughts, Instructor Chu Il-hwan, who had finished forming the groups, stepped forward and said.\n\"The test will begin in one hour from now. The content of the test is simple. You must survive my pursuit.\"\nWith those words, Instructor Chu Il-hwan took out a small bell from his pocket and tied it to his belt.\n\"I will pursue you while wearing this bell. You will move one hour ahead to move out, erase your tracks, and evade my pursuit. The longer your team survives, the more bonus points you will receive. However, if you try to leave Taecheon Peak and get trapped in the formation, you will fail the exam, so be careful. Lastly...\"\nAs if to draw the disciples' attention, Chu Il-hwan paused briefly before continuing with his characteristic mischievous smile.\n\"Any team that succeeds in taking this bell from me will receive the highest score, regardless of time.\"\nIt was a smile that seemed to challenge them to try if they could.\n\"Well, the explanation is over, so start moving now!\"\nAs soon as Instructor Chu Il-hwan's command fell, all teams scattered and began running in different directions.\nFollowing them, the waiting instructors and assistants also deployed their stealth techniques and pursued their assigned teams.\nAmong them was Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi.\n'An exam close to actual combat. When several people are mixed together in such situations, their true nature tends to emerge.'\nThe team he was following was none other than the fourth team, the one to which Il-mok belonged.",

If that's the case, wouldn't it be better to overlap our traces instead?\"\n\"Overlap traces? What do you mean by that?\"\n\"Just before we dispersed. Team Three ran in this direction.\"\n\"Ah!\"\nOnly then did the group members understand Il-mok’s intention.\nAnd thanks to employing their lightness technique at full power, they could easily find traces of people who had passed through.\n\"These appear to be traces left by Team Three. We'll follow them.\"\nFollowing Il-mok's direction, they moved along the traces left by Team Three for a while.\nAt some point, the traces became blurry.\n\"It seems they started erasing their tracks from here.\"\nAt Seong Hwan's remark, Il-mok nodded and spoke.\n\"Now we're at a crossroads. Do we pursue them, or move in another direction?\"\n\"You mean we're chasing Team Three?\"\nPerhaps because they had been moving slowly since they started tracking Team Three, Bu Gayoung from the Lower Class, who had regained some composure, asked the question.\nBut before Il-mok could answer, Seong Hwan exclaimed, \"Ah!\"\n\"Are you planning to join forces with Team Three to catch the instructor?\"\nEveryone looked at Il-mok with faces of admiration at Seong Hwan's prediction. However, Il-mok shook his head.\n\"An alliance would be meaningless. Remember carefully. Instructor Chu Il-hwan said he would give the highest score only to the 'team' that steals the bell. Even if we form an alliance, only the group whose member directly obtains the bell will benefit, making it an alliance in name only.”\n\"Then why on earth are we chasing Team Three?\"\n\"Hmm. What if we create a fake alliance with them and then betray them since they might not notice it?\"\nWith Jeong Hyeon as the exception, the rest of the squad members started spouting their own ideas. Il-mok sighed inwardly.\n\"Think about it. The test rule is simply to survive for as long as possible. There was no rule prohibiting fights between disciples this time. If we subdue Team Three and let them get caught by Instructor Chu Il-hwan, we can at least avoid last place.\"\n\"!!!\"\nEveryone wore shocked expressions at Il-mok's explanation.\nSeeing their reactions, Il-mok secretly breathed a sigh of relief.\n'Did that work, more or less?'\nIn fact, there were several problems with the plan Il-mok proposed.\nThere was the possibility of failing to subdue them, or even being subdued in reverse. And in the worst-case scenario, there was the risk of being pursued by Chu Il-hwan during the fight and being eliminated as a group.\nStill, the reason Il-mok proposed this plan was simple.\nFirst, he was confident that they wouldn't be subdued by another team.\nAnd second...\n‘Wandering the mountains all day just to avoid someone who could pop out from anywhere at any time is the worst.’\nHe simply wanted to beat up another group and end the test swiftly so he could rest.\n\"Then, I think it would be better to pursue Team Three first.\"\n\"I think so too. Since we'll be leaving traces of two squads traveling together, it'll make it harder for Instructor Chu Il-hwan to approach, don’t you think so?\"\nOnce Seong Hwan and Lee Gyun supported Il-mok's opinion, the decision to chase Team Three naturally fell into place.\n\"Then, Disciple Jeong Hyeon, would you mind taking the lead to track Team Three traces? Your tracking skills are likely the best among us.”\nJeong Hyeon, who had been following about three meters behind, showed a surprised expression at the sudden call. But perhaps due to his experience from the previous test, he quickly regained his composure.\n\"Ah, understood, Young Master.\"\nWhile Jeong Hyeon stepped forward, Il-mok instructed the other team members.\n\"The three of you, move while erasing the traces behind us.\"\nAt Il-mok's command, the remaining three quickly moved to the rear and began erasing the tracks they had made, as well as the faint tracks left by Team Three that had gone ahead.\nThis was to delay Instructor Chu Il-hwan as much as possible, should he pursue them.\nAnd after quickly giving his instructions, Il-mok walked leisurely behind Jeong Hyeon, who was tracking Team Three's traces at the front.\n'Having five team members is certainly convenient.'\nWhether it was erasing traces or tracking them, these tasks required constant rummaging through undergrowth and dirt.\nFor Il-mok, who suffered from a cleanliness compulsion, it was the worst thing possible.\nAnd with more team members, he could naturally pass those dirty tasks to the other four.\nYeom Ga-hwi was trailing Il-mok's party from a distance, concealing his presence.\nAs a warrior of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult who had carried out various missions, he was well-versed in the art of stealth.\nWatching them divide roles and move in an organized manner, Yeom Ga-hwi thought, ‘ It seems Disciple Bang Mi-hwa's assessment was somewhat mistaken.’\nIt was nearly impossible for someone shy to give such proactive directions. On top of that…\n‘Instead of choosing to flee, he chose to subdue another team. Not only is he quick to grasp the essence of the test, but he's also bold.'\nFor a bold person to be shy was also somewhat contradictory.\nIn that sense, Yeom Ga-hwi wanted to give Il-mok a passing grade.\nFrom assigning personnel to the right places to his bold judgment and commands, he exuded a level of experience hard to believe for a sixteen-year-old.\n'Could the rumors be true?'\nThe rumors he was thinking of were not the ones circulating in the Hall of the Demonic Way. There were rumours about Il-mok's achievements at the main headquarters before entering the Hall.\nTales about the school program and the meditation hall. Even rumors that he had led the Eldest Young Master to enlightenment.\nYeom Ga-hwi, with his straightforward character, wasn't one to be swayed by rumors, but at this point, it would be foolish not to believe them.\nWhile Young Master Il-mok showed outstanding talent in both martial arts and mental cultivation, there was one thing that bothered Yeom Ga-hwi as his gaze moved past Il-mok to Jeong Hyeon, who was leading the way.\n'Hmm. I heard he requested to be placed in the same team as that female disciple?'\nObviously, Instructor Eun Ryeo had reported to both Chu Il-hwan and the Hall Master that Il-mok had made such a request when she put Il-mok and Jeong Hyeon in the same team.\nOf course, Instructor Eun Ryeo had granted Il-mok's request because she felt sorry for Jeong Hyeon's severe social anxiety.\nAnd this wasn't special treatment.\nSince tests were conducted once a month, teams were initially formed based on friendships or compatibility.\nIn fact, Bang Mi-hwa was teamed with her longtime friend Ha Young, and Dokgo Pae and Gwak Sul, who had shown good chemistry in the first test, were also paired together for this reason.\nThe reason Yeom Ga-hwi was concerned about Jeong Hyeon was different.\nAs Jeong Hyeon bent over to thoroughly examine the undergrowth or ground to track Team Three's traces, Il-mok would move while watching her from behind.\nAnd observing the two of them, Yeom Ga-hwi frowned.\n'Was he said to have an eye for women?'\nIl-mok's gaze towards Jeong Hyeon's backside as she bent over seemed very suspicious to Yeom Ga-hwi.\nOf course, it could be said that it was a perfectly natural posture when following the lead scout.\n'Did he request that with the purpose of puting her like that?’\nIn addition to the instructors' evaluations, Yeom Ga-hwi found it suspicious that Il-mok had specifically requested Jeong Hyeon for his team and had her take the lead.\nBut soon Yeom Ga-hwi shook his head.\n'Sigh. There's no need to view a disciple with unconditional negativity. Besides, it's not a sin for a young man to be attracted to women. Unless he were to force himself on her, that would be a different matter.'\nTrue to his just and upright character, the Hall Master tried to evaluate Il-mok fairly.\nAnd shortly after.\nSensing something, Yeom Ga-hwi stopped first, and soon Jeong Hyeon, who had been tracking the traces, also stopped and relayed information to her teammates through hand signals. New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on NoveIꜰire.net\nIt was a signal indicating that the team they were tracking was not far away.\nAfter confirming Jeong Hyeon's hand signals, Il-mok quickly gave instructions.\n\"Disciple Jeong, secure a good sniping position around here as you approach them slowly. The rest of you, follow me as we approach Team Three.\"\nAfter giving additional instructions to the three, Il-mok advanced toward the direction Jeong Hyeon had indicated, employing his stealth technique.\nThe moment he confirmed the figures of five people gathered beyond the bushes—\nPat!\nIl-mok unleashed his lightness technique at full power and lunged toward a disciple whose face he didn't even know.\nThe fact that he didn't even know their face meant that they were a Lower Class disciple.\nNo matter how uninterested Il-mok was in other disciples, he knew the faces of all the Upper Class disciples he studied with. After all, there were only ten of them.\nSimilarly, even though there were only ten Lower Class disciples, Il-mok barely remembered their faces because he didn't take classes with them.\nAt most, he only recognized Ju Seo-yeon and Jeong Hyeon.\n“What the—!?”\nWhen Il-mok suddenly emerged from the bushes and approached rapidly, the Lower Class disciple drew his sword in surprise, but—\nSwoosh.\nIl-mok dodged it with a graze and simply pressed an acupoint.\nThe remaining members of Team Three quickly tried to surround Il-mok for a joint attack.\n\"Haaa!\"\n\"Attack!\"\nSeong Hwan, Lee Gyun, and Bu Ga-young, who had followed behind Il-mok and joined in, each faced one opponent.\nIn the midst of this.\nShriek!\nWhen Jeong Hyeon unleashed supporting fire from afar, the battle naturally became one-sided.\nClang.\n\"Ugh.\"\nMeanwhile, Il-mok subdued another Upper Class disciple in just three exchanges.\nThanks to the insight he gained from his previous duel with Baek-cheon, his skills had advanced considerably.\n'Damn. Should I be happy about this?'\nBut Il-mok's expression wasn't particularly bright.\nPerhaps due to his compulsive disorder, his sword moved along the most optimal path even when he wanted to fight half-heartedly.\nTo the point that he felt an ominous feeling that he might receive another enlightenment.\nAs Il-mok glared at his sword hand with an unpleasant expression after subduing two people alone, Yeom Ga-hwi, who had been watching the battle between Teams Three and Four from afar, nodded and thought, 'Indeed.'\n'At least he is sincere when it comes to the sword.'\nDespite reaching an overwhelming level compared to his peers, it was clear to Yeom Ga-hwi that Il-mok was still not satisfied with his swordsmanship.\nAround the time Il-mok and his team were subduing Team Three.\nTeam One, where Dokgo Pae had appointed himself team leader, had stopped walking and was standing somewhere.\n\"Let's rest now and prepare for the decisive battle.\"\nThe team members showed puzzled expressions at Dokgo Pae’s instruction, and one of them, Gwak Sul, stepped forward and asked.\n\"Are you perhaps planning to fight another team and eliminate them first?\"\nGwak Sul had also reached a conclusion similar to Il-mok's.\nBut there was one thing he overlooked. Namely, Dokgo Pae's way of thinking.\n\"What are you talking about? As the eldest son of the Dokgo Family, shouldn't I naturally aim for the best?\"\n\"???\"\nConcealing his inner thoughts of what kind of bullshit is that? Gwak Sul pondered for a moment before reaching an ominous conclusion.\n\"D-don't tell me. Are you aiming for the instructor?\"\nAt Gwak Sul's question, Dokgo Pae nodded as if it were obvious.\n\"Hahaha. If we just catch Instructor Chu Il-hwan, we get the highest score. Why bother chasing other teams?\"\nGwak Sul felt an inexplicable headache at Dokgo Pae's nonsense.\nMeanwhile.\n\"What an excellent idea, Disciple Dokgo! Indeed, a disciple should aim for the highest score, shouldn't they?\"\nSuddenly, Ju Seo-yeon, who was ranked last overall, supported Dokgo Pae's opinion.\nHer thinking was simple.\n'I need to get the highest score and quickly rise to second place!'\nHer only thought was to become Jin Hayeon's junior by reaching second place.\nBut for some reason. Dokgo Pae furrowed his brow when Ju Seo-yeon took his side.\n\"Ahem. Call me Team Leader!\"\nIt was purely because of the title.\n\"Understood, Team Leader! Let's catch the instructor together!\"\n\"Hahaha. A student who speaks my language! Let's get the highest score together.\"\nWatching the two laugh boisterously in agreement, Gwak Sul thought.\n‘I wonder if defecting to another team is against the rules?’\nSomehow, this test felt doomed as well.",

    "content": "Chapter 85: The Greatest Prodigy of the Demonic Way (4)\nGwak Sul, who had momentarily tried to escape reality, finally gathered his wits and asked, \"Then, how will you prepare for the fight against the instructor, Team Leader?\"\n\"Prepare? What is there to prepare? After getting enough rest, I'll aim for a head-on battle!\"\nGwak Sul's fist twitched involuntarily, but he couldn't bring himself to swing his weapon.\nIt was obvious they would lose. This was the problem with being smart—you couldn't attempt something crazy because you knew better.\nStill, with his experience from the previous test, Gwak Sul decided to try coaxing and persuading Dokgo Pae.\n\"Team Leader, if this test were like the previous martial arts competition, you'd be right. But this test is an integrated evaluation of all our training. Tracking, concealment, traps, and the like are all part of the test.\"\n\"Disciple Gwak is right, Team Leader. Even if you aim for a direct confrontation, there's no guarantee the instructor will accept it, is there?\"\nChoi Woong chimed in, supporting Gwak Sul.\nHe too, being a 'somewhat' normal person, instinctively realized that their grades would plummet if they continued this way.\n\"Especially if we don't prepare traps or countermeasures in advance, there's a risk that other teams might interfere while we're fighting the instructor.\"\nWith Gwak Sul's final addition, Dokgo Pae, who had been negative until now, finally nodded.\n\"Indeed. The Young Master might pull something like that.\"\nDokgo Pae recalled the ambush during a meal in the previous test.\n\"In that case, you two start preparing the traps. You both seem to have a knack for it.\"\nHearing Dokgo Pae's instruction, Gwak Sul and Choi Woong, who had advocated for setting traps, exchanged a look.\n'...You've been through a lot.'\n'That's how it turned out....'\nMisery loves company, they say.\nThey understood each other's feelings with just a look.\nAround the time when Choi Woong and Gwak Sul were hurriedly preparing traps, Team Two which included Bang Mi-hwa and Ha Young had also stopped moving and mapping out their plans.\n\"I think it's best for everyone to scatter and hide as much as possible from now on.\"\nBang Mi-hwa said haughtily, fluttering her fan open.\n“Hmm. Wouldn’t sticking together at least give us a chance to snatch the bell if we encounter Instructor Chu Il-hwan?”\nWhen a squad member raised this objection, Bang Mi-hwa raised her chin and replied.\n\"Hmph. How foolish.\"\n\"!?\"\n“Even I, whose talent the Hall Master recognized and keeps an eye on, cannot yet gauge Instructor Chu’s full strength. It goes without saying that the instructor can’t kill us, but that also means that someone like Instructor Chu wouldn’t be choosy about his methods. He will hunt us down one by one using hit-and-run tactics and tracking skills.\"\nHaving painted Chu Il-hwan as a villain before he did anything, she continued confidently.\n\"In any case, the evaluation criterion for this test is how long we can survive. There was no condition that team members must stay together. If we scatter and at least one person survives while the other teams are being taken down by Instructor Chu Il-hwan, that means victory for us.\"\nHer team members stared at her with blank eyes at her logic.\nThey weren't shocked by her reasoning.\nThey instinctively realized that she wasn't someone they could reason with.\nExcept for one person.\n\"As expected of Mi-hwa!\"\nHa Young, Bang Mi-hwa's best friend, was praising her with an admiring expression. They were truly a well-matched pair.\nWith the gaze of her friend who was singing her praises and the other three squad members who were staring blankly, Bang Mi-hwa's pride swelled even more. Content orıginally comes from Nove1Fire.net\n'Hmph. I intended to bring the Young Master to his knees this time, but with the test like this, it can’t be helped. Well, as long as I’m the last one surviving, it’ll be my victory anyway.'\nConfident in her victory, she said, \"Well then, let's start moving. Hide and erase your traces as much as possible.\"\nAt her instruction, the three team members who couldn't even voice their opinions inwardly sighed and began to scatter.\nAnd Instructor Eun Ryeo, who had been watching them from beyond the bushes, also let out a faint sigh.\nIt wasn't because Bang Mi-hwa's plan was foolish.\nThe tests at the Hall of the Demonic Way were designed to present situations similar to real combat, allowing observers to see how the disciples navigated through them.\nIn that sense, dispersing for survival was certainly a valid approach.\nThis is especially true in cases where information that absolutely had to be reported to the Cult was obtained during a mission. Situations where they would scatter to ensure at least one person survived and returned could certainly arise.\nThe problem was a lack of manpower.\nAfter letting out a faint sigh, Instructor Eun Ryeo gave instructions to a nearby teaching assistant using hand signals and they each began to chase after one person.\nThat meant the other three were now beyond the reach of surveillance.\nAround the time when the squad with Il-mok had subdued Team Three, and the other two squads had each established their own strategies...\n\"Hmm.\"\nChu Il-hwan, confirming that the hourglass he had set had run out, stretched lightly and started moving.\n'Does Disciple Il-mok's team go in this direction....'\nChu Ilhwan, who had unknowingly thought about chasing after Il-mok, soon changed his mind. It was an exam, after all, so there was a need to proceed with some degree of fairness.\nExamining the traces left by the four teams, Chu Il-hwan began following the one that had left the most noticeable trail.\nA series of metallic sounds rang out around Chu Il-hwan as he moved swiftly, following the trail.\nIt was the sound coming from the bell attached to his belt.\nThe disciples being pursued could run away upon hearing this sound, but Chu Il-hwan didn't mind.\nAfter all, the bell was placed there for that very purpose, and he knew there was still quite a distance between him and those he was pursuing.\nHe knew this from the traces they had left behind.\nChu Il-hwan, who had been moving at full speed, began to slow down at some point.\n'These traces aren't that old.'\nRealizing he was getting closer to his targets, Chu Il-hwan started moving slowly to prevent the bell from ringing, continuing to follow the trail.\nAfter moving stealthily for a while...\nSmirk.\nThe corner of Chu Il-hwan's mouth curved upward.\n'Interesting. Let's play along, shall we?'\nQuickly composing his expression, Chu Il-hwan continued to follow the trail with a feigned oblivious look and—\nThud.\nAt some point, he felt an odd sensation from the ground beneath his feet.\nSnap!\nSimultaneously, tree vines twisted as if to bind his legs.\nSwish!\nSharply honed tree branches poured down from the air in succession.\nBut as Chu Il-hwan lightly swung his right hand, the black lightning that spewed from his hand burned the branches in an instant.\nAnd the moment Chu Il-hwan executed his technique—\nPat!\n\"Die!!\"\n\"Now's our chance!!\"\n\"Hyah!\"\nDisciples sprang out from all directions at once, unleashing their techniques at Chu Il-hwan.\nHowever, their moves merely cut through empty air.\n\"Don't you think it's a bit harsh to tell your instructor to die?\"\nChu Il-hwan, who had swiftly leaped into the air with superior lightness skills, chuckled playfully as he brought his hands together.\nCrackle!\nAs the black lightning from both hands crossed each other, it expanded with a booming sound.\n\"Haah!\"\nWith a shout, a massive surge of black lightning shot toward the disciples from his outstretched hands.\n\"Dodge!\"\n\"Damn it!!\"\nBut given the scale of the technique, the disciples could easily leap in various directions to avoid the strike.\nNo, it was Chu Il-hwan who had deliberately used such a technique for them to dodge.\nAfter all, he couldn't kill the disciples during the test.\nThud.\nLanding on the ground, Chu Il-hwan immediately leaped toward one of the disciples who had scattered in all directions to avoid his previous technique.\n\"Haah!\"\nFaced with Chu Il-hwan's rapidly closing distance, Ju Seo-yeon thrust her spear.\nHer spear, which emphasized the principle of illusion, showed bizarre trajectories and created phantoms.\nGrasp.\nChu Il-hwan immediately identified the real one and grabbed the side of the spear with his right hand.\nCrackle!\nThe black lightning emanating from Chu Il-hwan's right hand traveled along the spear and burrowed into Ju Seo-yeon's body.\n\"Kyeeeeek!\"\nWhile she was screaming strangely as the electric shock paralyzed her, Chu Il-hwan quickly seized her pressure point and flung his body sideways with her slung over his shoulder.\nAs she let out a pained scream from the electric shock, Chu Il-hwan quickly pressed her pressure point, slung her over his shoulder, and leaped to the side.\nBOOM!!!\nRight after, an explosion erupted from where Chu Il-hwan and Ju Seo-yeon had been.\n\"Disciple Dokgo, are you trying to kill your fellow disciple?\"\nIt was the carnage Dokgo Pae had created.\n\"Minor casualties are bound to occur in the process of capturing an enemy commander, Instructor!\"\nAs he was putting down the subdued Ju Seo-yeon, Chu Il-hwan involuntarily winced at Dokgo Pae's nonsense.\n\"You have a point, but this is a test, not actual combat.”\n\"Didn't you tell us to treat it like a real situation?\"\n\".......\"\nShould I kill him?\nThe thought momentarily crossed Chu Il-hwan's mind, but he easily suppressed the murderous impulse.\nBecause a more amusing prank had come to mind.\n\"Come at me.\"\n\"That's what I was thinking!\"\nProvoked by Chu Il-hwan, Dokgo Pae charged like a wild boar.\nChu Il-hwan, employing dazzling footwork, easily evaded Dokgo Pae’s attacks. Furthermore, Chu Il-hwan subtly moved towards the other disciples.\nAs a result...\n\"W-wait a moment!\"\n\"Team Leader, stop!!\"\nDokgo Pae's sword, failing to hit Chu Il-hwan, ended up flying towards his own team members.\n“Grr! Get out of the way!”\nDokgo Pae shouted as if his teammates were merely obstacles, relentlessly unleashing his offense-focused Dokgo's Nine Swords without pause.\nAnd due to Dokgo Pae's crude swordsmanship, the other team members couldn't even properly execute their martial techniques and were desperately trying to dodge.\nAs for Chu Il-hwan...\nThud.\n\"One more down.\"\nHe simply subdued the disciples whose stances had been compromised by Dokgo Pae.\nEventually, it wasn't long before all of the disciples except Dokgo Pae were subdued.\n\"Isn't this too underhanded?!\"\nWhen Dokgo Pae let out an enraged shout, Chu Il-hwan responded with a sly smile.\n\"Didn't you say you'd treat it like a real situation? If you say such things in a real battle, you'd be treated as a fool, Disciple Dokgo.\"\nIn response to Chu Il-hwan's playful provocation, Dokgo Pae’s expression turned resolute instead.\n\"It's better this way! Now that I’m the only one left, I’ll face you fair and square, Instructor!”\n\"Alright. Come and try again.\"\nChu Il-hwan, deciding to end the prank there and showed a rare serious expression. Dokgo Pae unleashed his Dokgo’s Nine Swords, pressing against Chu Il-hwan.\nClang!\nClang!!\nMetallic sounds echoed as Chu Il-hwan's hands, wrapped in black lightning, repeatedly clashed with Dokgo Pae's great sword.\nDokgo Pae's great sword, wrapped in Sword Qi, did not shake easily even after clashing with the black lightning, and Dokgo Pae endured the lightning qi and continued to maintain his offensive.\n'Oh. He has certainly improved quite a bit in the past two months. Is it because he has set Young Master Il-mok as his target? Or is it due to the Hall Master’s special training? Maybe it’s both.’\nHe indulged Dokgo Pae for a while, meeting all of his attacks.\nAs he played along with Dokgo Pae's endless offensive, the urge to kill began to rise again.\n'I should end this now.'\nRealizing that dragging it out further might turn a precious cadet into a charred lump, Chu Il-hwan’s demeanor changed. His once playful eyes turned serious.\nAs he struck down Dokgo Pae’s technique with his right palm…\nThud!\nHe closed the distance with greater speed than before and instantly struck Dokgo Pae’s abdomen with his left palm.\n\"Kuk...\"\nAs Dokgo Pae collapsed, gripped by the lightning qi penetrating his abdomen, Chu Il-hwan, now with a smiling face again, pressed Dokgo Pae's pressure point.\nAfter handing over the subdued disciples to the instructor in charge of Team One, Chu Il-hwan set out on a journey to find the other squads.\n\"Hmm?\"\nIn the process, he came across a small trace.\nA trace too small for five people traveling together.\n'Hehehe. This batch is definitely interesting.'\nChu Il-hwan was pleased with the different approaches taken by each team.\nBut fun was fun, and a test was a test.\nChu Il-hwan pursued that trace and was able to easily find a member of Team Two who was acting alone.\n\"It's fun, but finding the remaining four will definitely be cumbersome.\"\nAfter muttering his impression, Chu Il-hwan moved on to find new traces.\nAfter wandering the mountain for a while, Chu Il-hwan began to move cautiously to hide the bell sound, and—\nHeh.\nChu Il-hwan's mouth curved up to his ears as his eyes met with a new target.\nAnd the target who met eyes with Chu Il-hwan—\n\"Damn it.\"\n—Was Il-mok, whose face crumpled immediately.",

    "content": "Chapter 86: The Greatest Prodigy of the Demonic Way (5)\nThe moment Il-mok's eyes met Chui Il-hwan's face through the bushes, one thought immediately crossed his mind.\n'Should I run?'\nIf the five of them scattered and fled in different directions, one or two might get caught, but the rest would likely survive.\nBut...\n\"Hehehe. There you are. Disciple Il-mok.\"\nThat madman was staring intently at him alone as if the other four team members didn't even exist.\nIl-mok instinctively realized that if they scattered in all directions, that lunatic would definitely chase him alone.\nOf course, that wasn't the problem.\nEven if he got caught, the other four would survive.\nHe just needed to run as far as he could and surrender immediately when he got caught. It would be troublesome if he exchanged blows and some kind of enlightenment dawned on him.\n\"Scatter imme—\"\nJust as Il-mok had organized his thoughts and was about to give instructions to his team members, he hesitated.\nHe realized there was a very big problem with the plan he'd come up with.\nDuring the escape, if he fell behind alone, got caught by that crazy instructor, and was subdued...\nThe thought that there would be no one around, just the subdued him and that instructor, sent intense warnings throughout his body.\n'Fucking hell.'\nRealizing he was in danger of having his precious chastity violated, Il-mok hastily changed his words.\n\"Don't scatter! Form a battle formation!\"\n\"!?\"\nThe team members who were preparing to use their lightness skill wore bewildered expressions, but their bodies quickly followed his instructions.\nHaving moved according to Il-mok's instructions all along, their bodies reacted automatically.\n“Oh~? You choose a direct confrontation? Unexpected.\"\nAs Chu Il-hwan licked his lips with interest, Il-mok felt chills running down his spine.\n'Right. Fuck. No matter how crazy that bastard is, he wouldn't pounce on me in front of all the team members, would he?'\nIl-mok had decided he didn't care if he was caught by that damned instructor and received a low score. His purity was more important than the score.\nSeeing Il-mok's resolute expression as if declaring a fight to the death, Chu Il-hwan smiled unexpectedly, then—\nPat!\nHe explosively used his lightness skill and charged forward.\nBut his target wasn't Il-mok.\n\"Damn it!\"\nSeeing Chu Il-hwan bypassing him and rushing to the side, Il-mok drew his sword in shock and chased after him.\nBecause his target happened to be Jeong Hyeon.\nHe was trying to grab Jeong Hyeon, who was stealthily retreating to provide support with his bow.\nAlarmed, Il-mok rushed toward Chu Il-hwan, swinging his sword repeatedly through the air.\nSwish!\nSword Qi formed along Il-mok's swings and flew toward Chu Il-hwan's side, but Chu Il-hwan easily avoided them with his footwork.\n\"Protect Disciple Jeong!\"\nAs soon as Il-mok's command fell, Bu Gayoung, who was closest to Jeong Hyeon, hurriedly swung her whip.\nMoving eerily like a snake, the whip tried to wrap around Chu Il-hwan's body, but Chu Il-hwan extended his right palm and caught the whip.\nCrackle!\nBlack lightning burst from Chu Il-hwan's right palm and traveled along the whip into Bu Gayoung's body.\n\"Kyaaaak!\"\nWhile Bu Ga-young screamed from the electric shock, Jeong Hyeon, who had already aimed his bow, released arrows toward Chu Il-hwan.\nBut Chu Il-hwan didn't panic.\nHe pulled his right hand that was holding the whip, and Bu Gayoung, whose muscles had spasmed from the lightning qi, was dragged along with it.\nThud! Thud!\nThe arrows, whose tips had been blunted to prevent casualties during the test, repeatedly hit Bu Gayoung's back. Using Bu Gayoung as a shield, Chu Il-hwan instantly moved his left hand to press Bu Gayoung's acupoint.\nOne person was subdued so easily it felt almost anticlimactic, but Il-mok didn't care.\n\"Haaah!\"\nWhile Bu Gayoung was being neutralized, Il-mok had already approached Chu Il-hwan and was swinging his sword.\n\"Phew.\"\nJeong Hyeon, who had barely retreated, exhaled in relief and was nocking another arrow.\nOn top of that.\n\"I'll join in!\"\nSeong Hwan and Lee Gyun also quickly drew their weapons and charged toward Chu Il-hwan.\nChu Il-hwan watched Il-mok's sword moving bizarrely, obscuring his vision, and leisurely dodged or blocked the attacks by alternately swinging both hands.\nSwish!\nMeanwhile, he effortlessly dodged the arrows shot by Jeong Hyeon.\nHis attitude was as relaxed as if he were appreciating Il-mok's swordsmanship, despite Il-mok's teammates Seong Hwan and Lee Gyun joining the fight.\n\"Haah!\"\nSeong Hwan and Lee Gyun, who had finally approached, swung their spear and sword respectively, targeting Chu Il-hwan.\nAnd Chu Il-hwan, who had been casually engaging with Il-mok, finally began to move in earnest.\n\"Huhuhuh.\"\nThere were two reasons why he had been leisurely engaging with Il-mok.\nOne was to see how much the Young Master had improved over the past two months.\nAnd the other reason—\n\"Just because there are three of you doesn't mean you're three times stronger.\"\nAs an instructor, he wanted to teach them how dangerous poorly coordinated group attacks could be.\nSurrounded by the three, Chu Il-hwan deflected the incoming sword and spear with his palms. Then, seizing the opening, he displayed his unique nimble footwork and dived toward Lee Gyun.\nIt was a perfectly timed move.\nStartled by Chu Il-hwan's sudden approach, Lee Gyun hastily swung his sword.\nClang!!\nIt collided with Seong Hwan's spear, which was also targeting Chu Il-hwan, causing them to interfere with each other's movements.\nThe moment Lee Gyun hesitated after his hastily swung sword collided with Seong Hwan's spear—\n\"That's two down.\"\nChu Il-hwan, who had already dived into Lee Gyun's chest, simply pressed Lee Gyun's acupoint using his finger.\nOn top of that, he took Lee Gyun’s paralyzed body in his arms and threw him toward Il-mok, who was approaching with his sword.\n'Even in this situation, he doesn't hold back his lecherous thoughts!'\nShocked by Chu Il-hwan's boldness in embracing Lee Gyun, Il-mok had to quickly withdraw his sword and throw his body to the side to avoid colliding with the flying Lee Gyun.\nThud.\nThanks to Il-mok not catching him, the paralyzed Lee Gyun rolled on the ground.\nSwish!\nMeanwhile, arrows continuously flew toward Chu Il-hwan, shot by Jeong Hyeon who had been waiting with his bow aimed.\nHe couldn't find an opportunity to shoot because Il-mok, Seong Hwan, and Lee Gyun had surrounded Chu Il-hwan.\nInstead of waiting indefinitely for an opportunity that might never come, he had already put some distance between himself and Chu Il-hwan.\nCrackle!\nThe arrows Jeong Hyeon shot in ambush were instantly consumed by the black lightning emitted from Chu Il-hwan's left palm.\nBut it wasn't a meaningless attack.\nIn the meantime, Seong Hwan had retrieved his spear and was thrusting it again toward Chu Il-hwan.\n\"Let's take it easy!\"\nIl-mok, who had avoided Lee Gyun, had also dived back to Chu Il-hwan's side and was swinging his sword.\nChu Il-hwan had considered launching himself into the air to perform a technique like he did when subduing Dokgo's team, but soon realized an important fact and clicked his tongue lightly.\n'Arrows are troublesome opponents in midair.' ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ novel⟡fire.net\nQuickly organizing his thoughts, Chu Il-hwan leaped to the right, narrowly avoiding Il-mok's sword while simultaneously deflecting Seong Hwan's spear with his right palm.\nA similar situation unfolded.\nWhile blocking or avoiding the attacks from Il-mok, Seong Hwan, and Jeong Hyeon—\nPat!\nChu Il-hwan suddenly twisted his body, and Jeong Hyeon's arrow, which had been flying toward him, passed by and flew toward Seong Hwan instead.\n\"!!!\"\nThe startled Seong Hwan hurriedly rotated his spear to block the arrow—\nChu Il-hwan, as if waiting for this, dodged Il-mok's sword and dived into Seong Hwan's chest.\n\"Hehehe. Now only two remain.\"\nAfter pressing Seong Hwan's acupoint, Chu Il-hwan smiled slyly, causing Il-mok to frown.\n‘I don’t like it when things go in his way.’\nAs Chu Il-hwan had said, their incompetent teamwork turned out to be worse than having no teamwork at all.\nIt was because Lee Gyun and Seong Hwan's movements had actually interfered with Il-mok's swordplay.\nTo be precise, Chu Il-hwan had used his footwork to lead them into that situation.\nAnd as if pleased with Il-mok's frown, Chu Il-hwan smiled broadly and dived straight toward him.\nThud! Thud!\nSimultaneously, Jeong Hyeon's arrows belatedly hit the spot where Chu Il-hwan had been standing.\nAs Chu Il-hwan's left palm flew toward him—\n\"Phew.\"\nIl-mok sighed lightly and calmly thrust his sword in response.\nWithout his teammates getting in the way, he felt it was actually easier to swing his sword.\nOn top of that—\n\"!?\"\nClang!\nChu Il-hwan showed a perplexed expression for the first time and barely blocked Il-mok's sword.\nIt was because Il-mok's sword had flown straight for Chu Il-hwan's neck without bothering to set up a defense. As if aiming for mutual destruction.\nIt was a very contrasting sword style compared to his previous defensive swordsmanship, which prioritized his own safety.\nThe reason for Il-mok's sudden change in movement was simple.\nThanks to the previous fight, Il-mok had realized a very important fact.\n'This guy is holding back.'\nChu Il-hwan didn’t use any lethal techniques at all. To be precise, he had no real intention to kill.\nHe occasionally used lethal techniques as feints, but they were just that—feints to induce evasion or defense. In the end, all his real attacks were light ones.\nAn instructor shouldn't kill a disciple during a test, after all.\nRealizing his opponent's weakness, Il-mok's sword advanced along a path that disregarded defense.\nIn fact, Il-mok had two objectives.\nOne was to exploit an opponent's weakness who couldn't use killing techniques, as he knew he couldn't win with orthodox methods.\nThe other was—\n'One way or another, if I fight that madman any longer, I might get enlightenment!'\nWhether he won or lost, he just wanted to end the fight quickly.\nClang!\n\"Hooh?\"\nChui Il-hwan muttered with interest as Il-mok swung his sword in a suicidal manner like Dokgo Pae’s Nine Swords of Dokgo.\nAlthough it reminded him of the Nine Swords of Dokgo, Il-mok's sword was actually more complete in its execution. The sudden change in Il-mok's sword intent was also interesting.\n\"Hahaha! Good. Let's dance together!\"\nIntrigued, Chu Il-hwan gladly engaged with Il-mok's sword.\nSwish!\nAbandoning defense, Il-mok's sword flew concisely and blatantly targeting only Chu Il-hwan's heart, neck, or other vital points.\nChu Il-hwan moved both hands rapidly, completely blocking or deflecting all those sword attacks.\nFaced with Chu Il-hwan's suddenly defensive attitude, Il-mok felt like he was burning inside.\n'Just end this quickly, you crazy instructor!!'\nHe felt like enlightenment was about to dawn on him.\n'Hmm.'\nWatching Il-mok and Chu Il-hwan's battle through the bushes, Yeom Ga-hwi almost involuntarily made a sound.\n'I thought he was excellent, but to think he'd be this good...'\nChu Il-hwan, as the First Instructor, was the strongest man among the instructors.\nIt was surprising in many ways to see a mere disciple fighting evenly with him, even if Chu Il-hwan wasn't using his full strength.\nMoreover—\n'It's getting more refined.'\nThe more they exchanged blows, the sharper and more concise Il-mok's lethal strikes became.\n'They say the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword aims for perfection, but I can only say he's truly versatile.'\nIn the martial arts competition, he had demonstrated the principle of softness to the extreme, and now he was refining the principle of swiftness.\nWatching the high-level fight that could hardly be seen as one between an instructor and a disciple, Yeom Ga-hwi had a feeling that he might have to intervene in that fight.\n'...Instructor Chu's bad habit might act up.'\nIf things went on like this, Chui Il-hwan might go berserk and accidentally kill the Young Master.",

    "content": "Chapter 87: The Greatest Prodigy of the Demonic Way (6)\nYeom Ga-hwi's concern was not unfounded.\nThe more Il-mok sparred with Chu Il-hwan, the more refined Il-mok's swordsmanship became, the faster it grew.\n\"Hehehe.\"\nThe smile on Chu Il-hwan's face deepened with each passing moment.\nSlowly realizing that his own state was becoming strange, Chu Il-hwan understood that enjoying it any further was dangerous.\n'I should end this.'\nForcing himself to shake off the lingering disappointment, Chu Il-hwan began to fight in earnest.\nCrackle!\nBlack lightning coiled around his twin palms more intense than before, and he used lethal techniques as he struck at Il-mok.\nHe wasn't trying to kill him.\nIt was a feint to pressure Il-mok, who was attacking relentlessly, and end the fight quickly.\nBut...\n'As if I'd fall for that!'\nCertain that Chu Il-hwan wouldn't kill him, Il-mok ignored the palm strike flying toward his heart and swung his sword at Chu Il-hwan's neck instead.\n\"!?\"\nThe startled Chu Il-hwan hastily withdrew his right palm while simultaneously thrusting his left hand to barely deflect Il-mok's sword aimed at his neck.\n\"Hah!\"\nTaking advantage of Chu Il-hwan's momentarily broken stance, Il-mok seized the opportunity and intensified his assault.\n\"Do you have a death wish?!\"\nThe flabbergasted Chu Il-hwan shouted and began to draw internal energy from his dantian in earnest.\nHe needed to subdue Il-mok quickly, before he himself lost control.\nOn top of that, Chu Il-hwan started to unleash his Black Thunder Demonic Palm technique while radiating killing intent toward Il-mok.\nHowever, there was one thing he overlooked.\n'It's just another feint anyway.'\nChu Il-hwan's killing intent had no effect on Il-mok.\nNot just because he believed it was a bluff.\nIl-mok had experienced something far more terrifying than Chu Il-hwan's killing intent countless times.\nNamely, the killing intent and demonic energy his Master, the Heavenly Demon, had unleashed during what he called \"realistic combat training.\"\nOf course, the Heavenly Demon hadn't gone all out either, but compared to the killing intent generated by the Heavenly Demon, the pinnacle of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, Chu Il-hwan's paled in comparison.\n\"Hah!\"\nAs if Chu Il-hwan's killing intent was non-existent, Il-mok moved boldly.\nIl-mok's sword, targeting only Chu Il-hwan's vital points, repeatedly clashed with Chu Il-hwan's twin palms swirling with black lightning.\n\"Kup...\"\nPerhaps due to the inevitable difference in internal energy and realm, internal injuries accumulated, causing faint traces of blood to flow from Il-mok's mouth.\nSwiiiiiish! Swiiiiiish! Swiiiiiish!\nEvery time Chu Il-hwan paused while clashing with Il-mok, the arrows Jeong Hyeon shot from afar targeted Chu Il-hwan.\nTrying to subdue Il-mok, who was filled with suicidal determination, while additionally handling the pressure of Jeong Hyeon’s distant harassment is no easy task.\nThis made the battle even more prolonged.\n'Hehehe.'\nA playful smile had returned to Chu Il-hwan's face at some point.\nUnlike his usual manufactured smile, this was an impulsive one.\n'Hehehe. Fine. If you want to die so badly, I'll grant your wish.'\nHaving momentarily failed to control his murderous impulse, Chu Il-hwan's right palm shot toward Il-mok's heart.\nIl-mok, once again believing it to be a feint, countered with his own lethal technique.\nAnd just before Chu Il-hwan's right palm could burst Il-mok's heart...\n— HALT!!!\nNoticing the intent behind Chu Il-hwan’s attack this time, Yeom Ga-hwi delivered a harsh mental shock to Chu Il-hwan’s mind.\n\"!!\"\nBarely escaping Qi Deviation, Chu Il-hwan hastily withdrew some of the internal energy in his right palm while simultaneously twisting his arm.\nThe right palm that almost reached the left side of Il-mok’s chest faltered and his palm strike transformed into a finger strike aimed at Il-mok’s acupoint.\nWhoosh!\nMeanwhile, Chu Il-hwan dramatically twisted his upper body to avoid the sword Il-mok unleashed.\nPat!\nAs Chu Il-hwan and Il-mok's bodies passed each other like crossing paths.\nThud!!\nWith his acupoint struck by Chu Il-hwan’s finger, his body tumbled across the dirt.\n\"Huh...\"\nBut even after subduing Il-mok, Chu Il-hwan stared at the fallen Il-mok with an expression of disbelief.\nMore precisely, at something caught on the tip of Il-mok's sword.\n\"To think you'd aim for that in the middle of all that.\"\nIt was the bell that had been tied to his belt.\nIl-mok's sword, which appeared to be targeting Chu Il-hwan's neck, had twisted its path during that fleeting moment when Chu Il-hwan flinched at Yeom Ga-hwi's mental shout.\nAnd when Chu Il-hwan twisted his upper body to protect his neck while pressing Il-mok's acupoint, Il-mok's sword had cut the string that held the bell on his belt as if he had aimed for it all along.\nStrictly speaking, this happened because of Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi's intervention.\n'But that's irrelevant since I succumbed to the side effects of Demonic Arts in the first place.'\nChu Il-hwan clicked his tongue lightly and acknowledged his defeat.\n\"Congratulations. You've achieved the highest score on this test.\"\nAt his praise, Il-mok, who was sprawled on the dirt ground, said with a look of disgust.\n\"Could you please release my acupoints first?\"\nHaving engaged in such a precarious duel and now rolling in the dirt, Il-mok felt like his compulsive disorder was about to flare up.\nAs Chu Il-hwan approached to release Il-mok's acupoints, Il-mok suddenly convulsed and shouted.\n\"Re-release the other disciples' acupoints first! I-I can have mine released by another disciple later!\"\nHe had realized that he couldn't be sure what Chu Il-hwan might do in the process of releasing his acupoints.\n'Hooh. Thinking of your teammates first, even in this situation.'\nYeom Ga-hwi observed the entire process from a distance and stroked his beard with a satisfied expression.\nChu Il-hwan began to release the acupoints of the remaining disciples one by one, excluding Il-mok.\nAnd Jeong Hyeon, who had been shooting arrows from afar, had returned to the vicinity at one point.\n\"Disciple Jeong! Please release my acupoints!\"\nWhen Il-mok urgently called out to Jeong Hyeon, who was still maintaining a three-meter distance, Jeong Hyeon responded with a startled face.\n\"M-me?\"\n\"Yes! It must be you, Disciple Jeong! Please come quickly and release my acupoints!\"\n\"Co-couldn't you ask the instructor...\"\n\"Not the instructor! It has to be Disciple Jeong!\"\n\"......\"\nAt Il-mok's aggressive plea, Jeong Hyeon's face turned so red it seemed about to burst.\n'...So he does have an eye for women after all.'\nWatching from a distance, Yeom Ga-hwi nodded as if thinking, 'As expected.'\nWhen everything was wrapped up, the disciples were gathered one by one at the initial meeting place.\nAt the base of a large tree on one side of Taecheon Peak.\n‘Fufufu. As expected, my stealth skills are so outstanding that even Instructor Chu Il-hwan can't find me!'\nA woman was hiding there with a proud expression.\n'Huhuhuh. This time, victory is mine, Young Master!'\nFor a long time. Check latest chapters at novel⟡fire.net\nThe day after the second test ended.\nEveryone at the Hall of the Demonic Way was going about their day as usual. This was also true for Bang Mi-hwa, who had been discovered too late after being overly immersed in the test.\nHowever, there was one change the disciples weren't aware of.\nThat was the absence of the Hall Master.\nThe place where the Hall Master had gone, leaving the academy after a long time, was the Heavenly Demon Palace situated at the main headquarters.\n\"I pay my respects to the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons.\"\nYeom Ga-hwi paid his deepest respects to Heavenly Demon, who emanated no aura and wore a benevolent expression despite his high realm.\n\"Hohoho. Welcome, Hall Master Yeom.\"\nHeavenly Demon welcomed Yeom Ga-hwi kindly, like an ordinary elderly man from the countryside.\n\"Hohoho. Please rise.\"\nFollowing Heavenly Demon's command, Yeom Ga-hwi straightened his posture and formally presented a book he had brought to Heavenly Demon.\n\"Then, I shall return to the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\n\"Hohoho. Since you're already here, won't you have a simple cup of tea?\"\n\"What if the instructors cause trouble while I'm away? I cannot neglect the sacred mission you have entrusted to me.\"\nHearing Yeom Ga-hwi's straightforward answer, Heavenly Demon nodded and sent him back.\nShortly after Yeom Ga-hwi left the Heavenly Demon Palace.\n\"Hmm.\"\nWith a subtle expression, Heavenly Demon read the book that Yeom Ga-hwi had left behind.\nIt was a kind of evaluation report. One personally written by Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi.\nIt was based on what Yeom Ga-hwi had directly reported and felt, as well as the reports the instructors had submitted.\nSince the Hall of the Demonic Way was an institution responsible for nurturing talents who would carry the future of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, such evaluation reports were periodically delivered to Heavenly Demon every few months.\nObviously, he had received and read such reports before, but the Heavenly Demon was particularly looking forward to the newest report.\n'Hohoho. To think I'd become such a doting father in my later years.'\nIt was all because of that brilliant youngest disciple.\nGiven how he had stirred up various incidents even before entering the academy, it was quite curious to see what he had accomplished during his two months at the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nAnd knowing the Hall Master, his expectations grew even greater.\nHe knew that Yeom Ga-hwi was not the kind of sycophant who would only write praises about Il-mok to curry favor with him.\nTrying to suppress his anticipation, Heavenly Demon began to read through the evaluation report.\nWhether Yeom Ga-hwi had deliberately written it that way or not, Il-mok's evaluation was written quite far back.\n\"Hooh.\"\nAnd Yeom Ga-hwi's evaluation was filled with nothing but praise.\nConsidering his temperament, this was definitely not flattery.\n'Hohoho. As expected of my youngest disciple.'\nAs he continued reading the evaluation with a satisfied expression for a while, he unwittingly paused when he reached a section at the end.\n— Despite having such excellent qualities, he has the potential to become a womanizer.\nWords involuntarily escaped from Heavenly Demon's mouth.\n\"What is this....\"\nHe wasn't disappointed in Il-mok. It's just that.\n'That child has an eye for women...?'\nThere had been no sign of such tendencies before he entered the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nIn fact, when Heavenly Demon first assigned Jin Hayeon as Il-mok's attendant, it was partly a test.\nHe wanted to test what attitude Il-mok would display while being with Jin Hayeon, a young woman whose beauty was counted among the best within the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nYet, the youngest disciple who had stayed away from women, even when faced with Jin Hayeon, was now openly showing interest in women at the Hall of the Demonic Way?\nBut the upright Yeom Ga-hwi wouldn't lie about such things.\nAfter pondering for a moment, Heavenly Demon soon reached his own conclusion.\n'...It seems my youngest's taste is quite unique.'\nSomewhere in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's main headquarters as darkness fell.\nTwo elderly men were having a meeting.\nIn a room where all the lights were out, as if no one was there, with faces hidden.\nOne elderly man cautiously opened his mouth.\n\"Have you heard the rumors about the school program?\"\nThe first initiative Il-mok undertook was to establish schools in each branch of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult to educate children.\nA year had already passed since that began. The children, who initially began learning the Thousand Character Classic and basic exercises, had now started learning simplified doctrinal texts along with basic martial arts after a year.\nIn addition, reports were continuously coming to the main headquarters that the loyalty to the cult among the children learning to read and exercise, as well as their parents, was increasing day by day.\n\"I have.\"\nAt the other elderly man's calm answer, the one who had asked the question inquired again.\n\"Then, have you also heard the rumors about the Pure Mind Hall?\"\nThe second project that Il-mok had undertaken was a medical institution that couldn't be called \"Heavenly Demon Divine Cult Mental Ward\" and had come to be called Pure Mind Hall instead.\nThat place had also been open for more than half a year now, and it was building its system through information collected via consultations or medical texts.\nThere were stories that among the young martial artists receiving counseling, some had their side effects slightly alleviated, or even gained insights that led to higher achievements.\n\"I have.\"\nAgain, at the other old man's concise answer, the old man who had asked the question sighed softly and asked.\n\"The initiatives undertaken by the Youngest Young Master have all been proven effective. So, rather than killing the Eighth Young Master, wouldn't it be better to rope him to our side?\"",

    "content": "Chapter 88: Oblivion (1)\nThe old man across from him firmly rejected the proposal.\n\"That's impossible.\"\n\"...May I ask why?\"\nAt the distrust lacing that voice, the old man suppressed a sigh with effort and opened his mouth.\n\"We've already crossed a river of no return. We attempted to assassinate the Eighth Young Master, remember?\"\n\"...Couldn't we just hide that fact?\"\nThis time, the old man failed to contain his exasperation. He sighed heavily before replying.\n\"Hoo... As you say, the Eighth Young Master possesses an absurdly keen intellect. Do you think such a mind would be easily fooled? He might fall for it at first, but he's bound to notice inconsistencies as we work together. Can you honestly say you're sure he'll still be on our side then?\"\n\".......\"\n“If anything, joining hands with him now would only increase the risk of being betrayed at the most critical moment. It's especially dangerous because the Eighth Young Master has a strong bond with the Eldest Young Master.”\nWith nothing left to rebut, the elderly man across the table pondered for a moment before carefully opening his mouth.\n\"...If we can't make him an ally, then the best course of action is to eliminate him quickly.\"\n\"Indeed.\"\n\"So, is it ready? Are you sure we will be able to dispose of him without leaving any trace of our involvement?\"\nA faint white gleam appeared from across the table.\nIt was the reflection of moonlight on teeth revealed by a cruel smile.\n\"Word has arrived. We'll disguise it as a series of unfortunate incidents. Just because he is absurdly talented doesn’t mean he is immune to accidents.”\nA few days later, in the evening, a disciple of the Hall of the Demonic Way came to the Hall Master's quarters.\n\"Disciple Baek Cheon of the Demonic Way, here to see the Hall Master.\"\nIt was Baek Cheon, who had spent the last month or so carrying out the punishment given by the Hall Master.\nLooking at Baek Cheon, whose eyes were now clear unlike during the martial competition, Yeom Ga-hwi stroked his beard.\n\"You seem to have gained some insight.\"\n\"It's all thanks to the Hall Master and Disciple Il-mok.\"\nYeom Ga-hwi had a peculiar feeling.\n'Thanks to Disciple Il-mok, he says.’\nUnaware that Baek Cheon and Il-mok had spoken separately, Yeom Ga-hwi couldn’t understand why the Eighth Young Master’s name had suddenly come up.\nOf course, a peculiar rumor had been circulating within the Hall of the Demonic Way recently: that Baek Cheon would occasionally burst into maniacal laughter or break into strange smirks while undergoing his punishment.\nThis led to whispers that Baek Cheon had gone mad from his harsh treatment.\nBut just as with Il-mok before, Yeom Ga-hwi was not a man swayed by rumors. This update ıs available on novel(ꜰ)ire.net\n'I see. So that's how it is.'\nHe was a man who formed his judgments based solely on what he saw and felt. Thus, Yeom Ga-hwi assessed the situation from his own perspective.\n'He truly has broadened his vision. To the extent of feeling gratitude even toward Disciple Il-mok who caused him to receive such punishment.'\nLooking at Baek Cheon's clear eyes filled with conviction and certainty, Yeom Ga-hwi nodded.\n'It seems Disciple Il-mok's suggestion to spare him was a good one.'\nYeom Ga-hwi came to believe that a righteous and excellent member of the Demonic Cult had been born. All thanks to the Eighth Young Master.\n\"I will lift your restriction.\"\n\"Thank you, Hall Master.\"\nAs Baek Cheon bowed his head again in gratitude, Yeom Ga-hwi rose and approached Baek Cheon to release his pressure points.\n\"Huu.\"\nWith the powerful force that suppresses his internal energy and dantian vanished, Baek Cheon closed his eyes and began to control the demonic energy that threatened to run wild.\nHe managed to gather all his demonic energy with little difficulty.\nThis too was thanks to the insight he had gained while serving his punishment.\nWhen Baek Cheon opened his eyes, a radiant light shone from them, making them appear even clearer than before.\nWatching Baek Cheon, Yeom Ga-hwi offered words that mixed warning and advice.\n\"I'm lifting the restriction now not because I believe you've reflected sufficiently and come to your senses. It's merely a temporary release for tomorrow's expedition.\"\nDisciples in their second year at the Hall of the Demonic Way regularly embark on expeditions. They join one of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's various armed groups or organizations to directly observe and experience their operations firsthand.\nAnd as nearly a month had passed since their return from the last expedition, they were scheduled to depart on a new expedition tomorrow for further practical training.\n\"If any untoward incidents occur during this expedition, be warned that you will face an even greater punishment then.”\n\"I shall keep that firmly in mind.\"\nHearing Baek Cheon's response, Yeom Ga-hwi nodded once and dismissed him.\n“Then, go and prepare for tomorrow’s expedition.”\nBaek Cheon paid his final respects and then turned to leave the Hall Master’s quarters.\nBut his destination was not the Black Tiger Pavilion.\nUnlike his peers who had spent the past month reviewing what they had learned from the previous expedition, addressing their shortcomings, and preparing for the next one, he had merely repeated his punishment for a month.\nGiven his lack of preparation, he should be getting ready for the expedition right away.\nBut Baek Cheon thought there was something far more important to do.\nAnd this important matter was something he couldn't accomplish alone.\nThe place Baek Cheon headed after leaving the Hall Master’s quarters was to seek someone's help.\n\"Young Master Il-mok!\"\nThe place he sought was a modest vacant lot located in a secluded corner of the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nStartled by Baek Cheon's sudden appearance, Jeong Hyeon let out his characteristic strange shriek, while Il-mok, who had been enjoying an afternoon nap, turned his head with a scrunched face.\n\"Haah. What is it?\"\nDespite Il-mok's obvious annoyed expression, Baek Cheon didn't mind.\n“I came here because I have something urgent to ask you, Young Master.”\n\"Me? Is it related to the expedition?\"\nIl-mok asked this because he knew that Baek Cheon's class would be departing the next day, but Baek Cheon shook his head.\n\"It's something far more important than that.\"\n\"???\"\n\"I've been pondering continuously about the advice you gave me.\"\nIl-mok, who had been wearing a puzzled expression, finally let out a soft, \"Ah.\"\nHe recalled the advice he had given to Baek Cheon the other time.\n'Career counseling? But why me of all people?'\nHe had indeed given advice then, but he was still a year younger than Baek Cheon. At least physically, if not mentally.\nNo matter what advice he had given back then, Il-mok wondered if it was really necessary for Baek Cheon to seek him out again like this.\nBut, uncaring of Il-mok’s bothered expression, Baek Cheon continued to speak with sparkling eyes.\n\"What I truly enjoy. What I consider most valuable. After contemplating while receiving punishment from the Hall Master, I finally realized it.\"\n\"I, I see.\"\n\"What I truly desire is just one thing! And that is! Attention!\"\n\"....\"\n\"I enjoy attention more than anything else in the world! I've realized that the gaze of others looking at me is what keeps me alive and breathing!\"\nSeeing Baek Cheon's eyes shining with conviction, Il-mok was certain.\n‘This guy’s nuts.’\nRealizing this was someone he shouldn't associate with, Il-mok said, \"Congratulations. You've found your true self, and that's all that matters, isn't it? Now please leave.\"\nHe wanted to end the conversation quickly, but that didn't work with Baek Cheon.\n\"Didn't you tell me to set a grand ambition? So, I've set my own ambition. To become the most famous man in the world. A man who receives everyone's attention!\"\n\"...Crazy.\"\nBaek Cheon, who had been preaching with shining eyes, tilted his head at Il-mok's mutter that slipped out unconsciously.\n\"What did you say?\"\n\"Ahem. Uh, nothing. Anyway, since you've even set a great ambition, so that's that, right? Good luck.\"\nIl-mok even clenched his fist in encouragement, hoping the man would just leave, but the madman had no intention of departing.\n\"However, there's a problem that I haven't been able to solve even after agonizing over it for more than half a month since setting my grand ambition, so I came to you, Young Master.\"\nSeeing the madman continuing to speak only what he wanted to say, Il-mok sighed.\nHe wanted to beat him up and drive him away, but he couldn't.\nThanks to being tormented by that damn perverted instructor during the last test, he was in a precarious state himself\n\"Haa... What's the problem?\"\n\"I've set my great ambition, but I haven't found a way to achieve it. The only method that comes to mind right now is to become the Heavenly Demon in the future and receive the reverence of everyone, but that's too far in the future.\"\nJeong Hyeon, who was listening from behind, was shocked by Baek Cheon's bold declaration to become the Heavenly Demon, but Il-mok remained indifferent.\nIt was a waste to care about whatever the madman was saying. Besides, it was Il-mok himself who had urged him to have a grand ambition.\n\"That's why I've come to find the Young Master. Somehow, I thought a wise person like you might know a good method.\"\n\"So, you want to know a way to become famous and receive a lot of attention from people?\"\n\"That's right.\"\nAverting his gaze slightly to avoid the expectant look from the clear-eyed madman, Il-mok thought.\n'To think that the Baek Family's wild dog would become an attention seeker.'\nHe let out a hollow laugh at the unexpected turn of events.\n'Hm? Wild dog?'\nA thought occurred to him.\n'Isn't an executioner also a profession that receives a lot of attention from people?'\nNot in a good way, perhaps, but didn’t people flock to see the showmanship of performing sword dances and spitting alcohol before cutting off a criminal’s head?\n‘Hmm. Still, recommending the job of an executioner to someone who was called a good-for-nothing… doesn’t seem right.’\nWhile pondering what profession might be similar to an executioner, Il-mok soon exclaimed, \"Ah!\" and said, \"Have you ever heard of Bian Lian or Beijing Opera?\"\n(TL Note: Bian Lian, a traditional Chinese performance where the performer rapidly changes masks, creating the illusion of a person with an ever-changing face.)\nBian Lian is a famous mask-changing performance from Sichuan Province. Beijing opera is named for its development in Beijing. Both involve performing in front of an audience, much like an executioner’s performance.\nIn other words, they were a type of stage actor.\n'No matter how I think about it, there's no better profession for an attention seeker than an entertainer.'\nNot all entertainers were necessarily attention seekers, but for an attention seeker, there could be no better job.\n\"...I've heard of them, but are you suggesting I try Beijing Opera or Bian Lian?\"\n\"That's right. Didn't you say receiving attention is the most enjoyable thing in the world for you? Imagine yourself performing in front of people. Picture people admiring and becoming immersed in your performance.\"\nAs if Il-mok’s words had sent him into a reverie, Baek Cheon, his eyes glazed over, suddenly shivered violently.\nThe sight was so creepy that Il-mok almost involuntarily shuddered.\nBut Baek Cheon, emerging from his imagination, wore a surprisingly negative expression.\n“But how can I, as a martial artist of the Divine Cult, do such a thing? Though the gazes of others don’t matter to me, isn’t it something that doesn’t contribute to the great work of our Divine Cult?”\n\"What are you saying? Didn't you already memorize all the history and doctrines of our Divine Cult? Then, couldn't you perform the great records of the past Heavenly Demons in front of an audience?\"\n\"!!!\"\n\"It means you could become the vanguard in spreading the achievements of our Heavenly Demon Divine Cult and the past Heavenly Demons.\"\n\"In addition to gaining countless attention and fame! This is indeed the most suitable work for me!\"\nBaek Cheon's clear eyes flashed with radiance, and as if the mere imagination brought him joy, he shook his entire body again while shouting.\n\"It seems I made the right decision to come to Young Master Il-mok! Thank you so much!\"\nBaek Cheon took a step towards Il-mok to express his gratitude, but Il-mok quickly backed away.\nIl-mok’s gaze was fixed on Baek Cheon’s lower abdomen.\n'...He didn't wet himself, did he?'\nBecause of the constant shivering, Il-mok’s mysophobia was screaming alarms.\n“Ahem. No need for thanks, just be on your way.”\nBecause he felt like he was going to smell piss.",

    "content": "Chapter 89: Oblivion (2)\nBaek Cheon didn't back down easily.\n“If so, could you teach me about that Peking opera or Bian Lian? I need to learn that first before I can adapt it to fit the great achievements of the past Heavenly Demons!”\n\"Ahem. Sorry, but I've never seen it myself either. Besides, Disciple Baek, you have less than a year left until you graduate from the Hall, wouldn't it be better to learn it after graduation?\"\nBaek Cheon nodded in agreement at Il-mok's explanation.\n\"So the priority is graduating from the Hall! Understood. I won't forget the favor I received from you today, Young Master!\"\nAfter showing his respect with a salute, Baek Cheon departed with spirited steps.\nIt was hard to believe this was the same man who had been punished with kowtowing for a month until earlier today. His gait was remarkably light and cheerful.\nJeong Hyeon, who had been staring blankly at his retreating figure alongside Il-mok, carefully spoke, \"Y-Young Master seems to be very popular.\"\n\"What? What's that supposed to mean all of a sudden?\"\n“W-Well, Senior Baek Cheon, and also, aren't there many people looking for y-you, Young Master, every day?”\nJeong Hyeon spoke with slumped shoulders and a thoroughly dejected voice.\nWhile Il-mok was the only person she could call a friend, he had too many people seeking him out.\nShe was starting to feel anxious that Young Master Il-mok might become closer to others, and he would be forgotten.\nAnd for good reason.\nMany of those who sought Il-mok were far more accomplished than she was.\nPut aside her peers like Dokgo Pae and Bang Mi-hwa, even the problematic Senior Baek Cheon who had just visited was both the top scorer of his year and came from the prestigious Baek Family.\nAs her self-esteem began to plummet and she turned her head to avoid his gaze, Il-mok rubbed his arm from the goosebumps covering his arms. “Never say such horrible things again, even as a joke. I'm content just spending time here with you, Disciple Jeong.”\nBecause he couldn't stand lunatics.\nHearing Il-mok's blunt words, Jeong Hyeon trembled.\n\"Are you feeling unwell somewhere?\" Il-mok asked with a concerned voice, noticing Jeong Hyeon’s familiar habit.\nIt was a sight he had seen before. During their first meeting, Jeong Hyeon had suddenly had a seizure.\n‘If I get closer, it'll get worse, won't it?’\nKnowing Jeong Hyeon's side effects, Il-mok couldn't decide what to do.\n\"I-I'll go ahead first!\"\nWith a face flushed crimson, Jeong Hyeon fled the clearing.\nMeanwhile, around the same time.\nThe Black Tiger Pavilion was bustling with activity as they prepared for an expedition departing early the next morning.\nAmong those moving busily back and forth was Mak Ho-yeol, famous for his martial arts obsession.\nAfter completing all the preparations for departure, Mak Ho-yeol returned to his room and began his final preparation.\nWith a composed mindset, he ground some ink and began writing a message on paper.\nThe letter he wrote in a bold and uninhibited style befitting his personality was a kind of challenge letter.\nHaving caught the eye of Vice Hall Master Yu Geuk during the previous martial competition, he had received special training for about a month.\nThanks to that, he felt he had made noticeable progress, and he was confident of gaining achievements alongside the seniors of the martial units on the upcoming expedition.\nTherefore, he planned to challenge someone after returning from this expedition.\nHe would have preferred to challenge and duel every day, but he considered that disrespectful.\n'He is a man several levels above me. At the very least, I should make achievements for myself before challenging him again.’\nWith that thought in mind, Mak Ho-yeol finished writing his challenge letter, carefully folded it as soon as the ink dried, and rose to his feet.\nMak Ho-yeol left Black Tiger Pavilion and headed toward Black Dragon Pavilion.\n\"Disciple Il-mok!!\"\nThe person he wanted to challenge after the expedition was none other than Il-mok. Despite being his junior, Il-mok had become a goal that Mak Ho-yeol needed to surpass. Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on Nov3lFɪre.ɴet\n\"Come out for just a moment!\"\nAs Mak Ho-yeol kept shouting loudly at the entrance of Black Dragon Pavilion, Il-mok soon appeared.\n\"What is it?\"\nAlthough Il-mok wore a face that openly showed how annoyed he was, Mak Ho-yeol didn't care.\n\"Just take this. Junior.\"\n\"???\"\nIl-mok accepted the carefully folded letter that Mak Ho-yeol held out with a puzzled expression.\nWhat Mak Ho-yeol said next made Il-mok flinch involuntarily.\n\"I wrote it with all my heart.\"\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\"Since the day I first met you, I haven't been able to forget you for a moment.\"\nMak Ho-yeol had not been able to forget Il-mok's sword since the day he lost in the duel.\n'What kind of bullshit is this again?'\nOf course, Il-mok couldn't understand the mindset of a martial arts maniac.\n\"Read it well. I'll hear your answer after I return from this expedition.\"\nBut, as if that was enough, Mak Ho-yeol said only what he wanted to say and turned to leave.\nHalf in a daze, Il-mok looked around.\nWas it because Mak Ho-yeol had shouted so loudly? All of his peers were watching the scene. Even Jeong Hyeon's face was faintly visible through the shadows in the corner over there.\n'Is he feeling better?'\nRecalling what had happened at the clearing earlier, Il-mok was about to approach Jeong Hyeon, carelessly tossing aside the letter in his hand.\n\"Disciple Il-mok!! How dare you treat a letter that Brother Mak wrote with such care so carelessly?!\"\nSuddenly, that bastard Dokgo Pae jumped forward to block his path, throwing a fit.\nIl-mok sighed deeply at the meddling of Dokgo Pae, who was now boasting his close friendship with him as if they were long-lost brothers.\nEarly the next morning.\nThe senior year, including Mak Ho-yeol and Baek Cheon, departed from the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nPerhaps because the senior year had disappeared, the Hall of the Demonic Way had a quiet atmosphere.\nThis should have been good news for Il-mok, but he wasn't feeling at ease.\nFor some reason, Jeong Hyeon had started avoiding him since that day.\n\"Disciple Jeong!\"\n\"Hiiiiiek!\"\nIt went beyond simply avoiding him; if Il-mok came even slightly close, Jeong Hyeon would have a fit and run away.\nJeong Hyeon couldn't help it.\n—I'm content just spending time here with you, Disciple Jeong.\nIl-mok's words kept echoing in her mind, making her so embarrassed that she didn't know where to put herself.\nEspecially after what had happened in the mental realm last time, facing Il-mok had become difficult for Jeong Hyeon, his words were like a fatal blow.\n\"Haah.\"\nSighing as he watched Jeong Hyeon fleeing in the distance, Il-mok soon realized an important fact.\n'Come to think of it, why am I constantly chasing after Jeong Hyeon?'\nIl-mok had originally vowed not to associate with the prospective mental patients of the Hall when he entered.\n'Was I feeling lonely without realizing it?'\nThough Jeong Hyeon was a bit too shy and had a pathological aversion to being close to people, he felt a little more comfortable with him because he was calmer than the other crazy people.\n\"Tsk. I ran around for nothing.\"\nFeeling the sweat he had shed while chasing Jeong Hyeon, Il-mok gave up chasing Jeong Hyeon and headed straight to that quiet clearing.\nIt was the place he usually shared with Jeong Hyeon, but today Il-mok was alone.\nHe didn't particularly feel lonely. He didn't especially dislike being alone either.\n\"Well, if I wait here, he’ll come eventually.\"\nHe didn't know why he was avoiding him, but he thought it would be better to talk to him later when he had calmed down, rather than forcing someone who was visibly scared.\nHe was fairly confident that Jeong Hyeon would return.\n\"I'm alone, but Disciple Jeong doesn't have friends either.\"\nFortunately or unfortunately, Jeong Hyeon did not return to that quiet clearing.\nPerhaps he had come in stealth while Il-mok was napping, but the situation where Il-mok faced Jeong Hyeon did not occur.\nIn any case, Il-mok enjoyed his naps alone there every day, and time flew by so quickly that the third test finally arrived.\nAs usual, they were leaving the Hall of the Demonic Way under the guidance of an instructor.\nJeong Hyeon's figure could be seen among the disciples from the Lower Class following Instructor Eun Ryeo.\nMoving slightly apart from the other students, Jeong Hyeon quickly turned his head away in shock as soon as his eyes met Il-mok's.\n'...Is he really sick?'\nWhile Il-mok was thinking this, Chu Il-hwan began speaking to the assembled disciples.\n\"This test will be conducted in a much larger area than before. The map that I'm going to hand out now shows the destination you need to reach.\"\nAs soon as he finished speaking, the assistants, who were carrying some papers, sticks and whistles, started handing them out to the disciples one by one.\n\"Unlike the previous two tests, this test is individual. Points will be awarded based on the time and order of arrival at the destination. There are countless traps prepared along the way, so you must carefully observe the path as you proceed.\"\nIl-mok unfolded the map he received from an assistant while listening to Chu Il-hwan and sighed lightly.\n'It is quite far.'\nThe map showed as many as three mountain peaks.\nIt meant they had to reach a place that required crossing three of the countless peaks in the Tianshan Mountain Range.\n\"If you stray outside the area drawn on the map, you will be trapped in a formation. However, the formation is designed to lead in one direction, so you don't have to worry about getting stranded.\"\nThis time, Chu Il-hwan showed the whistle and stick in front of him as he spoke.\n\"These two are for emergencies, so keep them safe. The test will last for four hours. If you fail to reach the destination within that time, light this stick and blow the whistle. The instructors and assistants will come to rescue you.\"\nAs if to demonstrate, Chu Il-hwan lit a stick, and yellow smoke billowed out. The yellow smoke appeared to serve as a kind of beacon.\n\"Lastly, as with the previous test, instructors and assistants will patrol the test site starting fifteen minutes after the test begins. This is to find those who are injured by traps or stranded, but conversely, those caught by instructors or assistants will fail the test.\"\nIn response to his explanation, the instructors and assistants showed the bells tied to their belts.\nAfter briefly explaining the test, Chu Il-hwan jokingly smiled and added a warning.\n\"The test site is larger, so you'll have to be careful. Also, I hope you don't make the mistake of getting injured because of your greed for grades or failing to send a signal even after the allocated time has passed. This is a test where occasional casualties or missing persons occur.\"\nDespite his mention of casualties or missing persons, the disciples showed confidence and determination rather than surprise or anxiety. It was as if they had that much determination from the time they entered the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nSeeing these youngsters' fearless attitude, Il-mok shook his head.\n'These lunatics.'\nIt felt absurd that they would create such a test for sixteen-year-old children.\nMore explanations from Chu Il-hwan followed, and after finishing all explanations, Chu Il-hwan shouted and flipped an hourglass.\n\"Then, begin!\"\nAs expected, at the start of the test, Dokgo Pae and Bang Mi-hwa shouted confidently and started running.\n\"Victory in this test is mine!\"\n\"Young Master! I won't go easy on you this time!\"\nThe one difference was that Dokgo Pae ran alone, as it was an individual competition, while Bang Mi-hwa was, as always, with Ha Young.\n\"Phew.\"\nSighing, Il-mok turned his head to look in the direction where the Lower Class disciples were gathered. More specifically, in Jeong Hyeon's direction.\n'Although it's an individual test, I guess it’s okay to be together until the first half or so,' Il-mok considered.\nIt would be uncomfortable if a large number of people were gathered, but they would soon disperse anyway.\nHe was thinking of trying to talk with Jeong Hyeon then, but.\n\"!?\"\nUnlike his usual self, as soon as the test started, Jeong Hyeon dashed off like an arrow and instantly concealed himself with his stealth technique.\n\"Tsk.\"\nClicking his tongue in disappointment, Il-mok let go of his lingering thoughts and began walking while examining the map.\n\"So I have to cross three mountains.\"\nThe thought of sweating made him feel unpleasant in many ways, but unlike the previous test, no useful shortcuts came to mind.\n\"It's best to just finish quickly and rest.\"\nHaving sorted out his thoughts, Il-mok started walking.",

    "content": "Chapter 90: Oblivion (3)\nNot even a quarter of an hour had passed since the test began when red smoke started rising into the sky.\nThis wasn't because someone had already been injured or stranded. The sticks distributed to the disciples produced yellow smoke, after all.\nThough it hadn't been explained to the disciples beforehand, the red smoke came from traps.\n\"Hmph. Unbelievable.\"\nChu Il-hwan let out a hollow laugh at the sight of the red smoke and said to those waiting with him, \"There's still time left, but I'll go check it out first.\"\n\"Then we'll depart at the scheduled time.\"\nAfter finishing his conversation with the other instructors and assistants, Chu Il-hwan used his lightness skill and headed toward the rising red smoke.\nBefore long, he soon arrived at the location; a trap had revealed itself. It was a pit with blunt wooden stakes embedded in its floor.\nChu Il-hwan lightly descended into the pit and shattered the stick emitting the red smoke with a strike from his Black Thunder Demonic Palm.\nThese sticks were installed in every trap as a sort of safety measure.\nThough the traps had been designed with reduced lethality, people occasionally fell into them and sustained serious injuries.\nAnd those who suffered serious injuries usually couldn't use their signal sticks or whistles.\nThat's why this safety measure had been put in place so instructors or assistants could come check if there were any injured people at triggered traps.\nFortunately, it seemed no fool had been caught in the trap this time.\nJust after Instructor Chu Il-hwan destroyed the stick to prevent other instructors or assistants from needlessly searching the area and leapt out of the pit with a nimble movement—\nFar away, red smoke began rising again.\nAnd Chu Il-hwan was beginning to have a pretty good idea which foolish disciple was setting off traps one after another from the start.\n\"Looks like someone's just charging ahead in a straight line like a maniac.\"\nAs Chu Il-hwan predicted, the one who had triggered two traps already was none other than Dokgo Pae.\nWith a powerful battle cry, he sprinted ahead in a direct line.\nIf a massive tree blocked his path—\n\"Haaaaap!!\"\nWith a fierce shout, he unleashed his Dokgo’s Nine Swords technique, cutting down the giant tree with his sword wrapped in Sword Qi.\nBoom!!\nThe felled tree crashed down with a deafening boom.\nThe impact splintered smaller trees nearby, triggering a trap that sent a cloud of red smoke billowing into the air.\n\"Hahaha!\"\nBut acting as if such things didn't concern him in the slightest, he simply used his lightness skill again and continued charging forward.\nHearing the successive explosions nearby, Bang Mi-hwa sneered.\n\"Sounds like that wild boar from the Dokgo Family is rampaging again.\"\n\"If he keeps going like that, what you said might actually happen, Mi-hwa.\"\n\"Of course. Hohoho.\"\nBang Mi-hwa laughed haughtily with her nose in the air.\nUnlike Dokgo Pae, the two were advancing calmly. ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ novel✶fire.net\nNot only were they checking for traps along their path, but they were also carefully using their lightness skill to leave as few traces as possible.\nInstructor Chu Il-hwan had told them that, just like the previous test, the instructors and assistants would begin pursuit after one hour.\nMoreover, unlike the last test, it wouldn't be just Instructor Chu Il-hwan pursuing them.\nThe testing grounds were much larger than in the previous test, and since it was an individual competition, the disciples were all scattered.\nAdditionally, they only needed to reach the destination to complete the task, giving them a significant advantage.\n'If we don't leave any traces, that is.'\n\"Now that I look at it, that red smoke probably comes from the traps. Triggering a trap will leave traces even if you don't get caught in it. We need to be even more careful from now on.\"\n\"Wow! As expected of Mi-hwa! How did you notice that already?\"\n\"Ohohoho. Isn't it obvious? That wild boar keeps leaving traces everywhere, so it's just a matter of time before he gets caught by an instructor or assistant. I really don't understand how he became the second-ranked disciple with that brain of his.\"\nThe two advanced while chatting pleasantly.\nAll the while, they each kept watch to their left and right, trying their best not to trigger any traps.\nFurthermore, they meticulously checked their maps to make sure they didn't deviate from their course, maneuvering around trees and rocks to avoid leaving traces.\nAnd contrary to Bang Mi-hwa's arrogant attitude, this wasn't a strategy she alone had devised.\nWith two tests under their belt, the disciples had somewhat become accustomed to the Demonic Way’s method and were able to adapt to the challenges.\nSome, like Bang Mi-hwa and Ha Young, moved together, while others, like Dokgo Pae, went solo, but all were moving cautiously to avoid leaving traces.\nIl-mok was no different, except for one key difference.\n'Since Dokgo Pae is drawing all the attention, now is my chance.'\nIl-mok had also realized that the one causing a ruckus up ahead was Dokgo Pae.\nSo he slightly altered his route, moving away from Dokgo Pae's path and heading down a side path.\nThe instructors and assistants would surely chase Dokgo Pae first, so following the same route could put him in the line of fire.\nAfter successfully veering off to the side path, Il-mok turned back toward the destination and drew more internal energy from his dantian to increase his speed.\n'As long as I don't trigger any traps, it doesn't matter if I leave some minor footprints.'\nWhile everyone's attention was focused on Dokgo Pae, he intended to break through quickly from the side.\nAn hour passed.\nThe instructors and teaching assistants set out to pursue the disciples.\nThis included Chu Il-hwan, who had started ahead due to the traps Dokgo Pae had triggered right from the beginning.\nHe had checked a few more traps just in case, but once he was certain Dokgo Pae was the one rampaging, he stopped.\nThis was for the sake of fairness in the test.\nAnd now that an hour had passed...\n\"He's really making a mess of this test.\"\nWith a murderous smile, Chu Il-hwan was charging straight after Dokgo Pae.\nOf course, since it was a test tailored to the disciples' level, the instructors and assistants weren't pursuing ‘all traces'.\nThe instructors could track them even if the disciples put their hearts into erasing their tracks, but the policy for this test was to overlook traces that weren't too blatant.\nIn that sense, blatantly chasing only Dokgo Pae like this might seem to deviate from the purpose of the test.\n'But this is just too blatant!'\nHe was practically begging to be killed by leaving such obvious traces, so how could he not oblige?\nBeyond that, there was another reason for Chu Il-hwan's anger.\nThis test had been designed with several practical scenarios in mind.\nScenarios like securing classified information or special items and transporting them safely back to the Divine Cult, or infiltrating deep into enemy territory during mountain warfare.\nAnd that reckless charge was the worst possible approach for all the scenarios they had considered.\nTo make matters worse, because that madman kept triggering traps nonstop, they might not have enough manpower to chase the other disciples.\n'If this were a group assessment, I could at least try to spin this as a feint to strike the east while attacking in the west, but this is an individual test, you boarish bastard!!'\nWith veins popping on his smiling face, Chu Il-hwan charged straight ahead, swinging his palms to release bursts of black thunder each time he passed a trap triggered by Dokgo Pae.\nThe black thunder from his hands knocked down the sticks that were busily emitting smoke, extinguishing the red smoke.\nThis was to prevent other instructors or assistants who had just begun their pursuit from unnecessarily wasting their time on these traps.\nHe spent quite a while cleaning up the mess Dokgo Pae had left behind.\nIn just over an hour after the test began, Chu Il-hwan finally succeeded in catching up to Dokgo Pae.\nWhoosh!\nChu Il-hwan launched himself into the air with his lightness skill, then bounded across branches of giant trees to sprint through the air.\nOvertaking Dokgo Pae, he landed on the ground and blocked Dokgo Pae's path.\n\"Huff. Before we start, let me ask just one thing, Disciple Dokgo. What were you thinking, pulling such a brainless stunt?\"\n\"It's the fastest way to reach the destination, Instructor.\"\n\"Even though this will attract pursuers?\"\n\"If there are pursuers, I just need to defeat them!\"\n\"...Sigh.\"\nTo calm his murderous urge, Chu Il-hwan let out a deep sigh before saying with a sweet smile, \"First, let's start with a beating.\"\nAfter running for quite some time while observing the red smoke that kept appearing in the distance, Il-mok suddenly noticed the red smoke had disappeared and slowed his pace.\n\"Hmm?\"\n“Looks like he finally got caught.\"\nIl-mok realized that Dokgo Pae, who had been drawing all the attention, had been subdued.\n\"Still, thanks to him, I managed to get almost halfway without much trouble.\"\nAfter checking the map and roughly gauging his current position, Il-mok began moving more carefully to avoid leaving traces.\nHe continued at this pace for about an hour.\nBarely an hour had passed since the test began, and he had moved approximately halfway to his destination.\n\"!!!\"\nThe faint sound of a bell jingling reached him from a distance.\nRealizing that an instructor or teaching assistant was wandering nearby, Il-mok hid his presence as much as possible and carefully moved away from the direction of the bell sound.\nOnce he had put some distance between them, the small bell sound disappeared, and Il-mok corrected his course and continued toward the destination.\nBut before long, the bell sound was heard again, and Il-mok once more concealed his presence and changed direction.\nThis pattern repeated several times.\n\"Hoo. Did they finally leave?\"\nWhen the sound of the bell had completely disappeared, Il-mok let out a sigh of relief.\n\"Tsk. Wasted time for nothing.\"\nClicking his tongue lightly, Il-mok checked his map and increased his speed again.\nWhoosh!\nAfter pushing through the underbrush for a while—\nIl-mok felt an inexplicable sense of unease.\n‘I should be near the location soon.’\nAccording to the map, he should be at a distance where he can see the destination soon.\nAfter all, he had already passed one mountain peak shown on the map and was now climbing the next peak where the destination was supposed to be.\nWorse—\n\"This stream wasn't marked on the map either...\"\nBefore his eyes was a fairly large stream.\nOf course, the map distributed by the assistants wasn't that detailed. It wasn't the kind of map that showed every tree and rock.\nBut at the very least, all distinctive places were marked. Places like cliffs, or wide-open spaces where trees didn't seem to grow for some reason, and such locations.\nBut why wasn't this large stream marked?\nAs Il-mok pondered this question—\n\"Who are you?\"\nA voice suddenly came from behind.\n'A master!'\nStartled by the approach he hadn't even sensed, Il-mok turned around to find an old man with a cane looking at him with a gentle face.\n'An old man?'\nWhile his confusion grew, Il-mok made a respectful salute. Since the other party was a master, he decided to show courtesy first.\n\"I am Il-mok, a disciple of the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\n\"Hohoho. Hall of the Demonic Way. What a nostalgic name.\"\nIt seemed the old man had also graduated from the Hall of the Demonic Way in his youth.\nAfter the old man finished reminiscing about his past for a moment—\nHe tilted his head once, then asked Il-mok again.\n“Who are you to dare set foot on the sacred grounds of the Divine Cult?!”\n\"!?\"\n\"Aha! You must be an assassin sent by the Murim Alliance!\"\n\"!?\"\nIl-mok was momentarily taken aback by the old man's string of nonsense before he finally realized where he was.\n'Fuck. How did I end up at Oblivion Ridge of all places(忘我嶺)?!'",

    "content": "Chapter 91: Oblivion (4) Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs novel[f]ire.net\nThe Oblivion Ridge (忘我嶺).\nEven within the Tianshan Mountain Range, home to the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, it was notorious as the most dangerous and forbidden area.\nHowever, contrary to its reputation, the official designation given by the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult for this place was the Peach Blossom Ridge (桃花嶺)—a paradise-like place overflowing with flowers and fruit trees, just as the name suggested.\nAnd befitting its beauty, this place was meant to be a sanctuary, a kind of retirement haven for the elders who had dedicated many years of service to the cult.\nSo why was such a retreat saddled with the grim name of \"Oblivion Ridge\"?\nThe reason was quite simple.\nThe elders of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult were, by definition, old fogeys who had practiced Demonic Arts to high levels.\nBut those who had mastered their Demonic Arts to Transcendence generally occupy important positions, such as the Divine Guardians of the Cult, Law Enforcement Elders, Heads of the Five Great Families, or the Left and Right Guardians of the Cult.\nIt was a situation borne out of necessity to be able to manage the young, capable, yet mentally afflicted martial artists of the Demonic Cult.\nThis meant the elders sent to this ridge were not the ones who had achieved Transcendence. They were the unfortunate souls who had failed to reach that state with their high-level Demonic Arts. Instead, they were consumed by mental afflictions, eventually forgetting even themselves in their twilight years.\nThat's why it was called the Oblivion Ridge.\nBecause it was a prison holding old monsters who no longer knew who they were.\nThis might seem cruel for those who’d sacrificed themselves for the cult and gone insane, but it was unavoidable.\nThese elders, senile from their mental illnesses, were all formidable masters who had reached at least the Extremity of their Demonic Arts, if not higher.\nIf such masters were allowed to run wild after losing their minds, the very foundations of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult would be uprooted.\nYet killing those who had dedicated themselves to the cult would be too cruel, and crippling their martial arts was also too risky; who knew what horrors would unfold if they destroyed the dantian of men already driven mad by their martial arts?\nSo, as a last resort, they decided to send these senile old masters to Peach Blossom Ridge and contain them there using a powerful formation.\nAnd at this very moment...\n\"You insolent cur! As the Vice Commander of the Black Dragon Corps, I won’t give you mercy! Huh? Vice Commander of the Black Dragon Corps? You bastard! How dare you impersonate the Vice Commander of the Black Dragon Corps! As the Deputy Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall, I cannot let this stand!\"\nOne of these old monsters glared at Il-mok, radiating terrifying killing intent and demonic energy.\nIl-mok's heart sank.\nHe had some experience dealing with senile old men.\nIn his previous life, his job as a social welfare official meant he occasionally had to deal with such people, directly or indirectly.\nBut that very experience made him feel even more hopeless now.\nDealing with dementia patients required an almost superhuman level of patience.\nEspecially when...\n\"Die!!\"\n…the senile patient was a martial artist far stronger than he was.\nAs the old man swung the cane that had been supporting his body, a massive ink-colored Sword Qi curved like a crescent moon and flew toward Il-mok.\nIl-mok immediately bent his back almost to the breaking point. The colossal black energy wave skimmed just over the bridge of his nose.\nWHOOSH!\nWHOOSH!\nA series of thunderous booms echoed as trees behind Il-mok were cleanly sliced through.\nHaving narrowly saved his life, Il-mok quickly straightened his back to avoid the next attack, but the sight that greeted him stopped him dead in his tracks.\nThe old monster who had just demonstrated an absurdly powerful technique with a mere wooden cane was now groaning and sprawled on the ground.\n\"Ouch!\"\nIt was the price for swinging the cane that was supporting his body.\nHis memory was so scrambled that, despite demonstrating amazing swordsmanship, he’d forgotten how to maintain his stance or footwork.\n“Hehehe. To think you could knock me down! Excellent skill, young man!”\nThe old monster was even under the delusion that he had fallen due to Il-mok's attack.\nBut Il-mok found this sight more frightening than amusing.\n'This means there's a whole bunch of crazy geezers here?'\nHe’d gotten lucky this time with the old man falling, but there was no guarantee the same would happen next time.\nBesides, getting tangled up with this one could create enough noise to attract a whole horde of other crazy old men.\nFeeling like he was about to lose his mind, Il-mok furiously racked his brain.\nHow could he escape this retreat for crazy old people? No, how could he stop this senile old man's attacks?\nHe considered attacking while the old man was down, but that might provoke him into remembering his martial arts.\nEven worse, battling this nutjob could lead to enlightenment.\n‘Wait a second.’\nIl-mok realized something.\nWhy was he avoiding enlightenment so desperately?\nBecause he didn't want to go crazy.\nBut this place was the gathering spot for the craziest people within the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, which was already a cult of mentally unstable people.\nAbove all...\n—You've been running for more than half an hour. Don't you feel sticky?\n— Dirt and sweat are caked all over you. It’s disgusting!\nEven now, another self inside Il-mok's mind kept screaming.\nHis mind was spinning.\n'In a world of two-eyed people, a one-eyed person is a mutant, but in a world of one-eyed people, a two-eyed person is the mutant. If that's the case!'\nIl-mok had a new enlightenment, a different kind of secret technique.\nFollowing the first secret technique of Il-mok Style, \"The Youngest Young Master Hides His Talent,\" came the second technique.\nNamely, Gone Batshit Insane.\n\"Aaaargh! It's disgusting!! It itches!!”\nIl-mok suddenly screamed, then stripped off his martial clothes at incredible speed.\nSplash.\nHe jumped headfirst into the nearby stream.\n\"Heeheeheee! Hehehehe!\"\nThen, he burst into bizarre laughter while scrubbing himself furiously in the water.\nIt wasn't fake laughter.\nUntil now, he had been suppressing his other self to avoid becoming a madman, but now that he moved to the other self’s desire, a strange pleasure that was hard to describe was rushing in.\nAnd the old man, who had barely managed to get up using his cane, stared blankly at the frenzied Il-mok.\n\"Heehick! Gotta scrub harder! Skin, get clean! Oohahaha!”\nWatching Il-mok scrubbing his skin with smooth, round stones from the stream bed, the old man clicked his tongue.\n\"Tsk, tsk. Such a young lad, already consumed by madness. What a pity.\"\nThe old man shook his head before tilting it in confusion.\n\"Hmm? Why am I here?\"\nFalling into confusion, the old man began muttering incomprehensible words to himself before turning around and disappearing beyond the bushes.\nEven after the old man left, Il-mok couldn't stop immediately.\n\"I need a loofah. A loofah!!\"\nMuttering strange words to himself, he furiously messed up his hair, then hastily tidied it when his other self reacted to the disheveled state.\nAfter thrashing about for a while, Il-mok finally managed to stop and exhaled a rough breath.\n\"Whew. I feel like I'm going insane.\"\nTrying to regain control after letting go felt twice as difficult as it usually did.\nAfter subduing the demonic energy that threatened to drive him mad, Il-mok used his lightness skill to leap out of the stream at once. Then he approached the martial clothes he had roughly stripped off earlier.\n'Fuck. I have to put this back on?'\nIt was somewhat bearable when he was just wearing it, but the thought of bathing and putting on the sweat-and-dirt-stained clothes again made him want to curse.\nAfter agonizing for a while, Il-mok held his scabbard in one hand and pinched the dirty clothes with the fingertips of his other hand, and walked away without putting them on.\n'Let's move somewhere else first. The stream is dangerous.'\nThe crazy old men were likely to come here often to drink. Then again, were those senile old men even able to remember the stream’s location?\n'Damn it. I need to find a way out of here somehow.'\nAs he walked, Il-mok recalled the information Jin Hayeon had told him about the Oblivion Ridge.\nA massive formation blocked the Oblivion Ridge. To be more precise, it was designed to prevent people from leaving.\nIt utilized the Illusionary Dream Formation, causing people who tried to leave to walk in circles until they returned to their original position.\nBut that didn't mean there was no exit at all.\nA life gate (生門) opened at specific intervals, and during those times, a few warriors entered the Oblivion Ridge.\nWhile this was essentially a place of exile, they still needed to check on the elders' conditions.\nThose skilled in stealth would sneak in to check on their well-being, leave some food they'd brought, and leave through the life gate.\nAnd some warriors would wait near the life gate to watch for any elders trying to escape.\nWhich meant that, if he knew the location and timing of the life gate, he could escape easily.\n'But I have no idea.'\nIl-mok forcibly suppressed a sigh that threatened to escape and tried to think positively.\n'Okay, but if I just hold on, maybe the guys who come to Oblivion Peak will find me?'\nJust as he was thinking that he might escape if he could hold out long enough...\n\"Who are you?\"\nFrom beyond the bushes, the cold voice of an old man who had approached without any presence reached Il-mok's ears.\n'...Holding out my ass.'\nFaced with this sudden crisis, Il-mok forced his eyes to stay open despite the urge to squeeze them shut. This was a place where closing his eyes for a moment might cost him his head.\nIl-mok slowly turned to look in the direction of the voice and saw a strange old man.\nUnlike what one would expect from an elder suffering from dementia, the old man had a neatly groomed beard and hair and wore an impeccably clean martial outfit.\nAt least, he wore a spotless top .\nWhy his pants were missing was anyone’s guess. At least he was wearing underwear.\n\"Wandering around the Divine Cult’s territory in such a disgraceful state… You’ve got a death wish.”\nThe old man, ignoring his own barely clothed state, drew his sword and charged at Il-mok.\n\"!?\"\nIl-mok desperately looked around but was immediately filled with despair.\n‘If I knew this would happen, I’d have stayed in the stream!’\nThe situation was not conducive to activating his newly realized secret technique of going crazy.\nWith a feeling of resignation, Il-mok threw the dirty martial clothes he had been holding at the charging old man.\nSlash!\nAs the old man's sword cleanly cut the clothes in two, Il-mok quickly drew his own sword to block the old man's attack.\nClang!\nUnlike what one would expect from someone with dementia, the old man's sword drew a simple yet efficient path.\nAnd Il-mok was barely able to block the old man's consecutive attacks.\nNot because the old man's skill level was low, but because the sword path was too familiar to Il-mok.\nIncredibly, the sword technique the old man was using was the same as Il-mok's — the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\n\"You scoundrel! How dare you steal my martial arts!\"\nThe old man seemed to have realized this fact as well and swung his sword in rage.\nHis anger was so intense that a brilliant Sword Qi had already formed on his blade.\n\"You fucking lunatic!?\"\nHorrified, Il-mok dove for the ground, forgetting he was naked, and rolled desperately to avoid the old man's sword.\n'I'll die at this rate!!'\nHe was holding on because of luck and because the old man's sword path was familiar, but the situation could turn fatal at any moment.\nAs he rolled, Il-mok saw the old man's sword hurtling toward him and an idea struck him like lightning.\n'Fighting him is suicide! So…!'\nIt wasn’t enlightenment about the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\n\"Master! Have you already forgotten your disciple?!\"\nIl-mok yelled, then finished his roll by slamming his forehead to the ground in a deep bow before the old man.",

    "content": "Chapter 92: Master (1)\n\"Disciple?\"\nIl-mok, realizing he was still alive even after the kowtow, cautiously raised his head to see that the old man's sword had stopped just inches from his face.\nSword Qi is still swirling around it.\nHic.\nIl-mok couldn't help but hiccup, but he desperately pulled himself together and shouted, \"Yes, Master! Do you truly not recognize me?\"\n\".......\"\nThe old man squinted his eyes, examining Il-mok for a moment as if he were appraising an item.\nThen, with eyes full of longing, he asked, \"Could it be... Yeong-jin?\"\nSensing an opportunity, Il-mok immediately exclaimed.\n\"Yes, Master! I am Yeong-jin, your disciple!\"\n\"Well, well. To think that little rascal has grown up so much already.”\nThe old man looked down at Il-mok with a face full of emotion, then tilted his head questioningly.\n\"But, my disciple, why are you naked?\"\nIl-mok himself wanted to ask why the old man wasn't wearing pants, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it.\n'If I bring that up, who knows where the conversation might go.'\nIn the worst-case scenario, that sword might come flying at his neck again.\nInstead, Il-mok gave a somewhat honest answer, one that the old man, who had mastered the same martial arts, would likely understand.\n\"The dust and sweat on my clothes felt too sticky. I couldn't bear to wear them, Master.\"\n\"Hoho. To think your realm has already reached such heights, truly admirable.\"\nJudging by how the old man admired his obsession with hygiene, it seemed he suffered from the same compulsion.\n“Hmm. But still, you can’t just be walking around naked like this. Let's go back together.”\nAt the old man's invitation, Il-mok flinched involuntarily.\n\"Together... you say?\"\n\"That's right. Didn't you come here looking for your Master?\"\n\"Y-Yes, Master.\"\nIn the end, Il-mok began walking after the old man, feeling like an ox being led to the slaughterhouse.\n‘But, does he even know the way back to his house?’\nAs Il-mok followed behind wondering this, the old man suddenly stopped.\n'Damn. So he doesn't know after all?'\nBut Il-mok's judgment was wrong.\nThe old man suddenly turned around and asked Il-mok with murderous intent pouring out.\n“Who are you to approach me from behind without a sound?”\n\"!?\"\nIl-mok's mind went blank for a moment, but having prior experience dealing with an elderly person with dementia, he quickly pulled himself together.\n“Master! Have you forgotten already? It’s me, your disciple, Yeong-jin!”\nThe old man cast a doubtful gaze for a moment at Il-mok’s confident answer.\n\"Hmm. You seem younger than when I last saw you. Did you succeed in achieving Overhaul Body Transformation?\"\n\".......\"\nDidn't you just say I've grown so much a minute ago?\nBut getting serious wouldn't do him any good. When dealing with someone with dementia, extreme patience is necessary.\n\"O- Overhaul Body Transformation? That's beyond my level, Master. It's just that my skin looks better thanks to some elixir I happened to take. Hahaha.\"\n\"Oh? An elixir? You had a stroke of good fortune.\"\n\"Y-Yes, Master.\"\nThe old man nodded in understanding at Il-mok's answer and said, \"So that's why you're naked. The impurities must have dirtied your clothes.\"\n“T-that’s right, Master. My obsessive symptoms have gotten worse since I ate the elixir.\"\n“Hahaha. So that’s why you came looking for this old man again.”\n\"Yes, Master.\" The source of this content ɪs NoveI-Fire.ɴet\n\"Then let's hurry back home.\"\nThe old man smiled brightly as if happy to see his long-lost disciple and began walking ahead again.\nAfter walking for quite a while, the old man tilted his head and once again asked Il-mok with killing intent.\n\"Who are you?\"\n\".......\"\nIl-mok squeezed his eyes shut.\nAfter repeating similar but slightly different conversations with the old man several times, Il-mok finally arrived at the old man's house.\nThe old man walked easily on the path leading to a house despite his mind being in an endless loop.\nNaturally, Il-mok wondered if this was really the old man's house, but that doubt quickly vanished.\nFor good reason.\n“They say the young are resilient, but walking around naked is bad for your health. Wear this, at least.”\nThe old man, as if familiar with the house, took out martial garb and underwear and handed them to Il-mok.\nWhat’s more, the martial garb and underwear were in very pristine condition, and the entire house was tidied up in an orderly, angular fashion.\nIt was evident this was the home of someone suffering from obsessive-compulsive tendencies.\nHaving walked naked for quite some time, Il-mok put on the underwear and martial clothes the old man gave him while lost in thought.\nOne might wonder how an old man with jumbled memories could remember the way back home, but Il-mok was pondering a more important issue.\n'This is horrifying. Does this mean I could end up like that when my mastery of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword increases and I get older?'\nFor Il-mok, the old man was like a mirror reflecting his future.\n'I must not gain any more enlightenment.'\nIl-mok made a resolution.\nIf he managed to escape this Oblivion Ridge alive, he would work hard to play and eat well from then on.\nAs Il-mok put on all the clothes with a determined expression, the old man who had been watching said with a pleased look. \"Hahaha. Truly magnificent, Yeong-jin. Ah? Was it Taesu?”\n\"It's Yeong-jin, Master.\"\n“Hahaha. Yes, Yeong-jin. I'm glad you came all the way here to see your old man. Hahaha.\"\n\"Ahem. You said that the master is like another parent, so isn't this a natural thing to do?\"\n“Hahaha. Truly commendable. But this incompetent old man has nothing to give to his disciple. What should I do?”\n\"N-Nothing to give? You don’t need to give me anything, Master.”\nIl-mok waved his hands in refusal, but the old man wouldn't listen.\n\"No, no. How could I send away a disciple I haven't seen in so long empty-handed? Actually, this is perfect. Since you've come after so long, let this old man examine your swordsmanship.\"\nIl-mok almost made a face as if he’d eaten shit, but he barely managed to control his expression and asked back.\n\"...My swordsmanship?\"\n\"Yes. Let's go outside.\"\nAs the old man promptly headed out the door, Il-mok tried to come up with a trick.\n\"Why aren't you coming out?\"\n\"Master, weren't we just about to go in rather than out? Didn't you say we should enjoy some tea inside?\"\nDespite Il-mok's natural-sounding lie...\n\"Are you trying to belittle your master right now? Though I've grown old, do you think I can't remember what happened just moments ago?\"\nIt didn't work on the old man.\nUnder the old man's stern gaze and imposing aura, Il-mok swallowed his curses.\n'Why are you so clear-headed at times like this!?'\nEventually, Il-mok gave in to the old man's pressure and went outside.\n\"Show me the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword to the best of your ability. After checking your level, I'll give some teachings.\"\nFollowing the old man's instruction, Il-mok began performing a sword dance, deliberately being sloppy to avoid enlightenment.\nBut after just a brief moment...\n\"You rascal!! Are you trying to deceive your Master's eyes?!\"\nThe old man’s thunderous voice fell once again.\nThinking he might actually be killed by the old man at this rate, Il-mok finally demonstrated the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword to the best of his ability.\nThe old man, carefully observing Il-mok’s sword dance, nodded with understanding and said, \"To think you've already reached such a level, truly admirable. However, you didn't show the later forms at all. Did I forget to teach you that part?\"\nIl-mok couldn't help but flinch.\n'Damn. The latter forms are absolutely out of the question....'\nIl-mok had done his best to avoid practicing the later forms, fearing that the side effects would worsen.\n\"I-I simply haven't mastered the latter forms due to my insufficient skill level.\"\n“Hahaha. Isn’t this training a perfect chance? Only by correcting your shortcomings in training can you further refine your sword and be able to use it in actual combat.”\nThe old man stroked his beard with a teacher-like expression at Il-mok's excuse, then drew his sword and performed a sword dance.\nIt was very similar to the sword dance that the Heavenly Demon had performed when teaching Il-mok the later forms just before entering the Hall of the Demonic Way.\n'...Even while suffering from dementia, he hasn’t forgotten the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.'\nIl-mok wondered if it was because this Demonic Art was something the old man had devoted his entire life to or something else.\nAfter explaining all the key points and true meanings of the techniques along with the sword dance, the old man stopped and looked at Il-mok.\n\"Now you try it.\"\nAs his vision darkened, Il-mok offered a silent prayer and readied his sword.\n'Right, he'll probably forget again if I do it for a while.'\nIl-mok began performing the sword dance while trying to maintain positive thinking, but...\n\"Oh my. There. You need to tilt your sword more diagonally.\"\n\"Your internal energy flow isn't keeping up with the speed of your sword!\"\nFar from having fluctuating memory, the old man seemed to have his memory restored as he meticulously explained to Il-mok the later forms of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\nIt was truly a heaven-sent opportunity.\n'Damn it!! Why now of all times!?'\nOne that Il-mok didn’t want.\nAround the time Il-mok was \"thoroughly enjoying\" the fortuitous encounter that came with his newfound master, at a place some distance away from Oblivion Ridge.\nThe Hall of the Demonic Way's disciples, instructors, and teaching assistants were gathered there.\nThat place was the destination for the third test that had been conducted.\nAnd now, as the test time was coming to an end, a strange atmosphere hung in the air.\n\"Why isn't the Young Master here yet...?\"\nEveryone had expected Il-mok to come in first, but he not only wasn't in first place—he hadn't shown up at all.\nEven Bang Mi-hwa and Ha Young, who had won first and second place in this test due to Il-mok's absence and were initially pleased to have beaten Il-mok, now wore an uneasy expression.\nA restless atmosphere began to spread among the disciples, and Head Instructor Chu Il-hwan, who had to lead them, made a decision.\n\"Instructor Eun Ryeo. Take the disciples back to the Hall of the Demonic Way. The rest of us will search the test area to find Disciple Il-mok.\"\nMobilizing all the disciples to search the mountain would be faster, but there was a risk that other disciples might get into trouble during the process.\nSoon after, Instructor Eun Ryeo left with the nineteen disciples for the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nInstructor Chu Il-hwan along with the other began combing through the three mountains that had served as the test site.\n\"Disciple Il-mok!\"\n\"The test is over, come out now!\"\n\"Disciple Il-mok!! Come to your senses!!\"\nConcerned that Il-mok might be seriously injured and collapse somewhere, they shouted at the top of their lungs while searching for him. There was a slim chance that Il-mok, if unconscious, might wake up upon hearing their voices.\nBut no matter how loudly they called for Il-mok, there was no answer, nor was there any signal sent by whistle or stick.\nMoreover, because the test had taken place over such a vast area, and there were only seven people, including the instructors and assistants, it would inevitably take a long time to search the entire mountain.\nTracking Il-mok's trail wasn't easy either due to traces left by other people during the test. Finding traces was easy for them, but distinguishing whose traces they were proved to be not so simple.\nEventually, the sky began to turn crimson as they failed to find Il-mok, and Head Instructor Chu Il-hwan, who was in charge of the new disciples, had to make a decision.\nHe lit a stick to send a signal, calling back the assistants and instructors who had spread throughout the mountains.\n\"Enough time has passed; we've now reached the point where we can no longer handle this on our own.\"\nAfter saying this to the gathered assistants and instructors, Chu Il-hwan led them back to the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nUpon returning, Chu Il-hwan immediately went to the Hall Master's residence to report Il-mok's disappearance.\nAnd by the time the sun had completely set and darkness had fallen upon the sky...\n\"...What did you just say?\"\nThe news of Il-mok's disappearance reached the Heavenly Demon's ears.",

    "content": "Chapter 93: Master (2)\n\"Il-mok has gone missing?\"\nYeom Ga-hwi, who'd come to the Heavenly Demon to deliver the report, lowered his head and replied, \"Yes, my lord.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon suppressed the demonic energy that threatened to erupt within him.\nCrack.\nAs a result, the edge of the armrest of the chair that the Heavenly Demon was sitting on crumbled into dust.\nIt was the result of demonic energy that had momentarily leaked from his hand.\n\"Huff.\"\nLetting out a sigh and composing himself, the Heavenly Demon looked down at the bowing Yeom Ga-hwi.\n‘Hah. I thought I could fully control my emotions now.’\nIt suddenly occurred to him that perhaps his expectations for his youngest disciple were greater than he had realized.\nHowever, he couldn't take out his frustrations on Yeom Ga-hwi.\nIn the Hall of the Demonic Way, deaths or serious injuries among disciples were common occurrences.\nCases like this—getting lost during a test, or secretly leaving the Hall and becoming stranded—were rare but definitely happened from time to time.\nAnd the Heavenly Demon had never punished the Hall Master for such incidents.\nThe Hall of the Demonic Way was a place where children who had learned the Demonic Arts were trained. As it was a place for training talents who would be active on the front lines of the Divine Cult in the future, danger was part of the bargain.\nIn fact, the current level of danger is much reduced compared to before. In the past, Hall of the Demonic Way was a place where half of those who entered died thanks to the much more dangerous training and tests that were conducted.\nTherefore, if he were to punish the Hall Master every time such an incident occurred, the position of Hall Master would change hands several times a year.\nNow, if he were to punish the Hall Master because his own disciple had suffered the same fate, it would be inconsistent.\nAbove all, it would violate the principle that all disciples in the Hall of the Demonic Way were treated equally.\nSo instead of getting angry about what had already happened, the Heavenly Demon focused on dealing with the situation at hand.\n\"Tell the Hidden Guards and the Dark Shadow Pavilion to select personnel. And instruct those selected to immediately go to the Hall of the Demonic Way and track Il-mok's whereabouts.\"\n\"Understood!\"\nAfter issuing instructions to the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master who was waiting nearby, the master saluted with clasped hands and disappeared into the darkness.\nThe Heavenly Demon's orders were quickly relayed, and soon after, those tasked with finding Il-mok departed from the headquarters toward the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nHowever, the number of personnel mobilized wasn't enormous.\nIt wasn’t solely due to his position as the Heavenly Demon that required him to distinguish between public and private matters properly.\nSearching for a missing person involves tracking traces. The more people there are, the more likely they are to interfere with each other's tracks and become a hindrance.\nIn the end, only those from the Hidden Guard Pavilion and Dark Shadow Pavilion who didn't have major duties were dispatched for the search.\nAmong them were Jin Hayeon, who was receiving special training from Hidden Guard Pavilion First Squad Leader Dam Bin, and Seo Wan-pyeong, Il-mok's senior brother and the Heavenly Demon's third disciple, who belonged to the Dark Shadow Pavilion.\nA late night hour when only the moonlight faintly illuminated the sky.\n\"...Youngest, where on earth have you gone?\"\nReaching the mountain where the test took place, Seo Wan-pyeong anxiously bit his fingernails and muttered while searching for Il-mok's barely visible traces. Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on NovєlFіre.net\n\"Don't worry, Third Young Master. If it's Young Master Il-mok, he'll certainly be safe.\"\nInstead, Jin Hayeon, whose experience and age were far inferior to Seo Wan-pyeong's, comforted him with a calm and cool demeanor.\nBut even behind her calm demeanor, she was far from at ease.\n…I have to believe you're safe.\nDeep within her seemingly cool gaze, a desperate feeling lingered. Her gaze scanned her surroundings meticulously, lest she miss even the faintest trace as she moved forward.\nAs time passed, they continued searching for increasingly faint traces that were being erased by natural winds and the activity of mountain animals.\n\"...Third Young Master.\"\n\"...I feel it too, Miss Jin.\"\nJin Hayeon and Seo Wan-pyeong had arrived somewhere together and were staring ahead with hardened expressions.\nBoth had graduated from the Hall of the Demonic Way, and because they had been briefed by the Hall's instructors for this mission, they knew—\nThis was the edge of the testing grounds, a place blocked by a formation.\nBut...\n“The formation… has been damaged.”\nCoincidentally, there was a slight gap in the formation at precisely this spot.\nTheir arrival here was close to accidental.\nWhile aimlessly searching the three mountains, they happened to discover a faint trace heading in this direction.\nAt first, they had considered ignoring it.\nThis area was blocked by a formation, and if someone had been caught in it, they would have been directed to a specific point as designed. If Il-mok had been caught in the formation, there would have been no reason for him to be missing in the first place.\n(TL Note: The formation within the testing area, not the one that enclosed the ridge.)\nBut since they had already searched most of the testing grounds, they had come here just in case and coincidentally discovered it.\n“Youngest!”\nSeo Wan-pyeong lunged toward the gap in the formation, but Jin Hayeon held him back.\n“Calm yourself, Third Young Master. Nothing is certain yet!”\n\"What are you saying? We’ve scoured most of the other areas already!\"\n\"There's still a possibility, however small it is. Besides, two people searching alone will only make things take longer. We should gather the others first. It would be better to begin a full-scale search together.\"\nSeo Wan-pyeong, on the verge of Qi Deviation, regained some composure at Jin Hayeon's persuasion.\nThe search was officially resumed around the time the sun rose again.\nA small number of people began searching the less-checked areas inside the formation, while most started searching in a semicircle, using the gap in the formation as a starting point. The area behind them was, after all, still within the formation's boundaries.\nAfter another half-day had passed, a report on the search results was delivered to the Heavenly Demon Palace by evening.\n“A slight gap has formed in the formation, you say… What are your thoughts on this matter, Array Master?”\nAn Hyo-gyun, the master of the Eight Trigrams Hall, which oversaw all formations and mechanisms of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, spoke in a calm tone.\n\"First, there's a possibility that someone tampered with the formation to create a gap but, \"After laying out the possibility of deliberate sabotage, An Hyo-gyun shrugged and casually added, \"During the testing and searching process, all traces have been mixed up, making it impossible to identify any culprit.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon kept his eyes fixed on the Eight Trigrams Hall Master while using his qi sense to monitor the movements of everyone gathered in the hall.\nHe already knew that the scene had been manipulated, making it impossible to identify any culprit.\nThat's why he had gathered the key figures of the Divine Cult while questioning the Eight Trigrams Hall Master.\nAnyone who showed surprise, anxiety, or relief might very likely be connected to this incident.\nUnfortunately, no one showed any special reaction.\nWhether they all concealed their true feelings like cunning snakes, or whether this truly was an accident, it was impossible to know.\nMeanwhile, An Hyo-gyun discussed the second possibility.\n“Also, there is a slight but definite possibility that a gap in the formation may have formed naturally. The formation created for this test was so large, and it was a temporary formation created for the test, so it would not be surprising if it were damaged by animals. If you check the records of the Hall of the Demonic Way, you'll find this has occasionally happened in the past as well.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon nodded in acknowledgment.\n‘My instinct tells me it’s the former, but given the precedent, forcing an interrogation would be pointless.’\nBut he wasn't dismissing the possibility entirely. He planned to have the Hidden Guard Pavilion conduct a secret investigation, but there were more pressing matters at hand.\n\"Then, we should prioritize rescuing Il-mok from Peach Blossom Valley. Eight Trigrams Hall Master, can you tell me when the life gate of the Illusory Dream Formation in Peach Blossom Valley will open?\"\n\"It's scheduled to open in six days.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon nodded and commanded those gathered in the hall.\n\"Then, as soon as dawn breaks tomorrow, I will go to Peach Blossom Valley with the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master.\"\n\"!?\"\nA wave of surprised looks washed over the assembled elders.\nIn the midst of this, Ahn Hyo-gyun, who had been conversing with the Heavenly Demon, asked without concealing his anxiety.\n\"You are not thinking of breaking through the Illusory Dream Formation, right?\"\nThe reason for his unease was simple. The thought of having to rebuild the formation again and recapture all the elders who might escape in the chaos made him feel dizzy with dread.\nBut fortunately, the Heavenly Demon hadn't completely lost control due to worry about his disciple.\n\"Don't worry. After securing Il-mok's safety, we will exit through the life gate in five days. I've called you all here to instruct you in advance on how to prepare while I'm away.\"\nThere was also the intention of identifying suspicious individuals through their reactions, but he saw no need to voice this reason.\nAfter the Heavenly Demon finished speaking, everyone gathered kowtowed themselves in respect.\n\"We obey your command!\"\nOne by one, they left the Heavenly Demon Palace and returned to their quarters.\n— The Heavenly Demon will visit that place tomorrow. Are you certain the youngest disciple is dead?\nDespite the sudden sound transmission, the old man showed no reaction as he continued walking and replied via sound transmission.\n—Do you forget what kind of place that is? No matter how talented the youngest disciple may be, it's not a place where a mere disciple from the Hall of the Demonic Way could survive for two days.\nAt that answer, the old man who had first sent the sound transmission secretly breathed a sigh of relief.\nIf he had shown any noticeable behavior, he might have aroused the Heavenly Demon's suspicion.\nThe night before, in front of the residence of the old man who had mastered the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword…\nWhile Il-mok was being force-fed about the teachings of the latter forms of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword —\nRustle.\n— A small rustle was heard before another old man appeared from the bushes.\n\"Who are you people to cause a disturbance in my residence?!\"\nAs the new old man shouted angrily, the old man who had been teaching Il-mok replied, \"Who are you to claim my house as yours?!\"\n\"What? You are courting death!\"\nWhen the new old man angrily swung his arm, crimson yang energy erupted along his palms, but —\nSwish.\nThe old man, who had already drawn his sword, cut that yang energy with a simple sword movement.\n\"Come on! Let's settle this once and for all!\"\n\"Hmph. Do you think you can defeat this old man with that level of skill!\"\nAs the two old fogey began to clash while shouting at each other, Il-mok stealthily moved away.\nThis is my chance.\nHe planned to sneak away while the two senile old men were fighting.\nBut...\n\"You there!\"\n\"Seeing how you're sneaking around, you must be the one!\"\n\"!?\"\nThe one what? he wondered. But logical thinking wasn't helpful right now as both old men simultaneously directed their killing intent toward Il-mok.\nHe quickly exclaimed.\n\"Master! I am your disciple, Young-jin!\"\n\"I have no disciple named Young-jin!\"\n\"Come to think of it, it was Young-jin!\"\nThe two old men, who had each said something different, looked at each other for a moment.\n\"Hohoho. How pleasant to see you here.\"\n\"It has indeed been a long time.\"\nThe two old men were suddenly greeting each other in a friendly manner.\nAfter exchanging some small talk with Il-mok's newfound master, the old man bid farewell and returned the way he had come.\n\"What are you doing? Shouldn't you be practicing the latter forms of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword?\"\nAnd then he abruptly started training Il-mok again.\nEven as his memory fluctuated, the memory of needing to teach his disciple remained clear. Truly the mark of a dedicated master.\nAfter being tormented by his new master for quite some time, the old man rubbed his stomach and said, \"I'm hungry.\"\nIl-mok, realizing that this was his chance, put down his sword.\n\"Disciple will prepare a meal for you right away, Master!\"\nThis was his chance to pause the training.\n\"Hohoho. A meal prepared by my disciple. It brings back memories.\"\nThen, the old man who had been reminiscing about his memories suddenly tilted his head and asked, \"Who are you?\"\n“…I am just a passerby.”\nIl-mok thought this might be his chance to escape, but he was a bit too hasty.\n“You’re an assassin from the Murim Alliance in disguise! Did you think I’d be fooled!”\n\"!?\"\nWhen the old man drew his sword, Il-mok hurriedly cried out, \"I-it was a joke, Master! I am your disciple, Young-jin! I was going to prepare a meal for you because you said you were hungry!\"\nHis happy life of abduction and imprisonment under his newfound master was truly enough to bring tears to Il-mok’s eyes.",

    "content": "Chapter 94: Master (3)\n\"Did I say I was hungry?\"\nThe old man stroked his belly with a confused look before nodding slowly.\n\"Now that you mention it, I am feeling a bit hungry. Hehehe. A meal prepared by my own disciple... How I've missed this.\"\nSensing another round of \"Who are you?\" coming like a broken record, Il-mok quickly escaped to the kitchen to prepare dinner.\nHe found a cooking area tucked away in one corner of the pavilion, lit a fire, and gathered whatever ingredients were available to prepare an evening meal.\n'These must be the supplies those martial artists leave behind during their visits.'\nHe began to think that staying here wouldn't be such a bad idea. Those martial artists might eventually discover him when they come to drop off food.\nWith decent ingredients at hand, Il-mok managed to prepare dinner quickly and carried the meal back to the old man.\n\"Who are you to be cooking for me? Scoundrel! You've definitely poisoned this food!\"\nWatching the old man spiral into another episode, Il-mok barely suppressed a sigh and repeated his earlier words.\n\"It’s me, Yeong-jin, Master. If you're worried about poison, I'll eat first. Let's dine together.\"\nIl-mok took a bite with his chopsticks, then used a separate pair to feed the old man directly.\nBut finishing the meal didn't mark the end of his troubles.\n'This is driving me insane.'\nHis body had become drenched in sweat again from practicing the latter forms of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword earlier.\n\"Hmm. You clearly need to wash yourself.\"\nThe old man, who apparently shared Il-mok's cleanliness obsession, wrinkled his nose at Il-mok's condition and stood up in displeasure.\nTo Il-mok's surprise, the old man returned carrying a bar of soap.\n'Did those martial artists provide this? Or did he make it himself because of his hygiene obsession?'\nEven if the martial artists had supplied it, people suffering from dementia rarely think to bathe themselves.\nYet this old man kept his clothes and living space immaculately clean, hardly typical behavior for someone with dementia.\nIt seemed that even while battling dementia, his compulsions continued to drive his actions.\n'Damn...'\nMisery loves company, as they say.\nThe realization filled Il-mok with a mixture of pity and understanding.\n\"I'll prepare your bath water, Master.\"\nFinding a water jar in the kitchen corner, Il-mok hauled it outside and used a ladle to splash water over himself before scrubbing down with soap.\nAfter finishing his own wash, Il-mok approached the old man.\n\"Master, let me wash you.\"\n\"Hehehe. It's been far too long since someone did this.\"\nAs he poured water over the obviously delighted old man and worked up a lather, Il-mok turned his head away to hide his pitying face.\nDawn the next morning.\nIl-mok, who had fallen asleep feeling refreshed after his bath, jolted awake in a panic.\n\"Who are you?! Why are you sleeping beside this old man?!\"\nThe sudden bellowing from beside him had startled him from sleep.\nStill groggy and disoriented, Il-mok struggled to gather his wits before shouting back. \"Master! It’s me, Yeong-jin!\"\n\"Yeong-jin?\"\nThe old man's face scrunched in concentration, as if trying to retrieve a distant memory.\n\"Ah yes, you came here to learn swordsmanship! Haha. Excellent. Let's head outside then.\"\n\"...Good grief.\"\nIl-mok turned away to hide his exasperation and reluctantly hauled himself upright.\nTime passed as he spent his time dancing with his sword in the darkness, learning the advanced techniques from his self-appointed master.\n\"You look hungry, it must be time for a meal.\"\nAt the old man's observation, Il-mok exhaled in relief.\n\"I'll prepare breakfast, Master.\"\n\"Hehehe. Focus, my boy. It's dinner time.\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\"Look at that sunset painting the sky red, clearly it's evening.\"\n\"......\"\nKnowing it was useless to argue, Il-mok simply nodded and headed for the kitchen.\nThe kitchen was stocked with foods perfect for long-term storage: jerky, fasting pills, dried vegetables, rice, and other preserved goods.\nFollowing yesterday's routine, Il-mok lit the fire, drew water from the jar, and simmered the jerky with vegetables to make a broth, adding rice to create something resembling porridge.\nImmediately after sharing this \"evening\" meal with the old man.\nTo avoid being subjected to training again, Il-mok came up with a scheme.\n\"Master, now that training is over, I'd like to wash up, but we're out of water.\"\n\"Hehehe. Water? Don't fret, my boy. There's a stream somewhere nearby. Hmm... or is there?\"\nMuttering ominously to himself, the old man took the lead while Il-mok followed with the water jar and soap in tow.\n'Even if we get completely lost, I'm just trying to waste time anyway, so it doesn’t matter.'\nThe water jar weighed considerably, but channeling his internal energy made carrying it manageable.\nAbout an hour into their journey toward this supposed stream, a strange old woman burst through the bushes, tilting her head in confusion.\n\"Where am I, and who am I?\"\nThe memory-addled woman stared at Il-mok and the old man with eyes filled with fear.\n\"Wh-where is this place?!\"\nThe woman erupted into a frenzy, flailing her arms wildly as razor-sharp palm qi shot from her fingernails, slicing through everything in sight.\n'Oh, shit!'\nJust as Il-mok was about to curse at the deadly energy hurtling toward him—\nClang!\nThe old man had somehow drawn his sword and effortlessly deflected every attack.\nAfter weathering the deranged woman's violent outburst for a while—\n\"Hmm? Ah! I was on my way home.\"\nThe suddenly docile old woman passed by Il-mok and the old man as if nothing had happened, heading somewhere.\n'...This place really is a demon asylum.'\nCold sweat trickled down Il-mok's spine.\nMeanwhile, the old man who had just blocked a lethal assault spoke as casually as if discussing the weather. \"Ah! Right, we were looking for that stream. Shall we continue?\"\n\"...I'll lead the way, Master.\"\nIl-mok, who had originally planned to kill time with the excuse of finding a stream, changed his mind.\nHe now understood that Oblivion Ridge was a nightmarish place where aimless wandering meant stumbling into random encounters with demented martial artists spoiling for a fight.\n‘For fuck sake, even if you suffer from dementia, shouldn’t you try to resolve things with words first?’\nFucking Demonic Cult.\nThese old monsters retained their ‘punch first, question never’ mentality even after losing their minds.\nDrawing on yesterday's route, Il-mok easily guided the old man to the stream.\n\"There we go.\"\nUsing internal energy to fill the jar, Il-mok addressed the old man. \"Since we're already here, why don't we bathe first, Master?\"\nWhile Il-mok was washing himself and the old man with the soap they'd brought—\n\"Who goes there?!\"\nYet another wild old monster appeared.\nAfter this new arrival exchanged several moves with Il-mok's master—\n\"Wait... Is that you, Brother Kang?\"\nThe old man who had been relentlessly attacking Il-mok's master suddenly stopped, his eyes widening in recognition.\n\"Hehehe. Well, I'll be damned. It's been ages.\"\nOnly then did Il-mok's master recognize his old acquaintance, and they exchanged greetings.\nWitnessing this entire exchange, Il-mok reached a sobering conclusion.\n'...Getting picked up by Old Man Kang was literally a godsend.'\nHad he continued wandering Oblivion Ridge alone, he would've been a corpse by last night or this morning at the latest.\nIt wasn't just because the old man had mistaken him for a disciple.\nFrom observing these exchanges between old monsters, this particular old man seemed to rank among the stronger residents of Oblivion Ridge.\nWith his confidence in the old man's abilities restored, Il-mok finally had the chance to appreciate his surroundings. Only now did he understand why this place had originally been called Peach Blossom Ridge.\n'It's absolutely gorgeous.'\nDespite being constantly torn apart by battles between demented martial artists, the landscape remained a stunning tapestry of trees and flowers. Among them, peach trees and other fruit-bearing varieties grew in abundance.\n'...Maybe they trapped these old monsters here specifically because of the fruit trees.'\nPerhaps the hope was that those who'd lost their mind could survive by foraging from these natural resources.\nWhile Il-mok was returning home with the old man and enjoying the scenery—\n\"How dare you trespass on Divine Cult territory!\"\nAnother wild old monster appeared.\nThe pattern repeated itself throughout their journey.\nIl-mok barely managed to escort the old man back to his dwelling in one piece.\n\"Ah! You mentioned wanting to train in swordsmanship, didn't you?\"\nRemarkably, the old man retained perfect recall when it came to Il-mok's training. It’s the one thing he never seemed to forget.\n'Son of a bitch! Why this of all things?!'\nIl-mok found himself subjected to yet another grueling session of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's advanced techniques.\nThe routine continued: when the old man grew hungry, Il-mok cooked; when they worked up a sweat, they bathed together using water from their jar.\n\"Who are you?!\"\nAnd obviously, the constant reintroductions had become as routine as breathing.\nAfter Il-mok endured another \"perfectly normal\" day, dawn broke on the third morning.\nNew figures appeared at Oblivion Ridge's entrance.\nThe Heavenly Demon and the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master had arrived, searching for Il-mok.\nThough the mountain's beauty lived up to its name as the Peach Blossom Ridge, neither visitor spared much attention to the scenery as they rapidly ascended.\n\"Who dares intrude here?!\"\nPredictably, a deranged old man blocked the Heavenly Demon's path, but no battle ensued.\nThe instant they encountered each other, terrifying demonic energy began radiating from the Heavenly Demon's body.\nDementia might steal most memories, but it couldn't touch the deepest, most fundamental recollections—the habits carved into their bodies.\nJust as these old monsters could still perform the martial arts they'd spent lifetimes mastering. Their body also remembered their habits as the devoted followers of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\n\"I bow before the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons!!\"\nRecognizing the distinctive, overwhelming demonic energy of the Heavenly Demon Divine Arts, the old man immediately prostrated himself.\nThe Heavenly Demon gazed down at the pitiful believer with a mixture of sadness and impatience before continuing onward. Finding his youngest disciple took precedence over everything else.\nHe wandered the mountain paths, and each time he encountered the local residents, he unleashed waves of terrifying demonic energy from his Heavenly Demon Divine Arts.\nFollowing traces of human passage, the Heavenly Demon eventually detected a familiar presence in the distance.\n'As expected, you're alive, my disciple!'\nGiven Il-mok's current abilities, survival in Oblivion Ridge should have been impossible.\nEven when setting out for this place, the Heavenly Demon had mostly expected to recover nothing more than his young disciple's corpse.\nYet he'd harbored a strange intuition.\nDespite being young and relatively weak, something told him this particular child would find a way to survive in this forbidden land.\nPerhaps it was because of what he had observed over the past year. The boy possessed not only martial talent but wisdom far beyond his years.\nThe Heavenly Demon's instinct proved correct, he could sense his living disciple.\nHowever, detecting Il-mok's presence didn't entirely lighten his expression.\n'He's performing the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword!'\nWith his sky-high cultivation, the Heavenly Demon could identify Il-mok's movements from the distant energy signature alone.\nTherefore, the Heavenly Demon used lightness skills, pushing through the bushes at tremendous speed toward the direction where he felt the presence.\n'Hold on just a little longer, my disciple!'\nCrossing the distance in what seemed like an instant, the Heavenly Demon finally reached the source of Il-mok's energy signature. His eyes widened at the sight of an elegant pavilion.\n\"!!!\"\nIl-mok wasn't locked in combat with some elder. He was simply practicing forms, working through the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword techniques.\nBut the Heavenly Demon's shock wasn't born from pride at his disciple's dedication to training in such a perilous location.\n\"Tsk! Put more power into that waist! You're hampering your next movement! Don't force it to stop, use the natural momentum!\"\nAn old man—one strangely familiar to the Heavenly Demon—was scolding Il-mok.\n\"Yes, Master!\"\nAnd his own disciple, Il-mok, was addressing this stranger as 'Master.'\n'What on earth...?'\nThe Heavenly Demon, who had rushed here with worry for his youngest disciple, felt like he was experiencing cognitive dissonance.

    "content": "Chapter 95: Master (4)\nHe stared blankly at the bizarre spectacle for a moment.\n\"Hehehe. Yeong-jin, your talent truly astounds me!\"\nThe moment that familiar name escaped the old man's lips, the Heavenly Demon grasped what was happening.\n‘So that's how it is.’\nThe Heavenly Demon nodded and deliberately made his presence known as he approached the pavilion.\n\"Who goes there!?\"\n\"Master?\"\nThe old man's sword flashed from its sheath in an instant as he fixed his glare on the Heavenly Demon, while Il-mok stared as if he'd seen a ghost.\n\"Master? What nonsense is this?\"\nOld Man Kang's face twisted with confusion at Il-mok's form of address.\nWitnessing this chaos, the Heavenly Demon let out a weary sigh and channeled his demonic energy.\n\"!!\"\nThat crushing aura filled the air, and only then did the old man recognize who stood before him. He threw himself to the ground in complete submission.\n\"This humble one greets the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons!\"\nThe Heavenly Demon sighed at the old man's desperate reverence. \"Rise, Elder Kang.\"\n\"Your servant obeys.\"\nAs the old man straightened with practiced grace, the Heavenly Demon spoke. \"I need to talk with your disciple Yeong-jin. Wait here.\"\n\"As you command.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon turned to Il-mok. \"Come.\"\nWatching the Heavenly Demon's retreating figure as he turned and headed into the thicket, questions only grew larger in Il-mok's mind.\n'...Why is Master here? Don't tell me he came to rescue me?'\nFollowing the Heavenly Demon into the woods, Il-mok didn't bother hiding his curiosity.\n\"Master! What brings you to this place?\"\n\"You, obviously. Who else?\"\n\"You came personally?\"\n\"This isn't somewhere just anyone can wander into. I had to come myself.\"\n\"Ah...\"\nAfter two days in this hellish place, Il-mok understood completely. The relentless attacks from those deranged old monsters weren't something ordinary martial artists could survive.\n'The cult leader himself came all the way here just to save me.'\nA flicker of gratitude stirred in Il-mok's chest.\nNot that he had much reason to feel grateful.\n‘Is this Stockholm syndrome or something?’\nAfter all, it was because of this ‘Master’ that he'd been dragged into this crazy cult in the first place. Feeling grateful toward the source of his misery seemed pretty twisted.\nBut as that tiny spark of gratitude flickered, Il-mok caught the strange look in the Heavenly Demon's eyes and his blood went cold.\n‘I'm dead.’\nIn this world, serving two lords marked you as unfilial scum. Just look at how people treated Lü Bu.\nThe same applied to switching masters. The saying of ‘A teacher a day, a father for life’ isn’t just some empty saying in this world.\nIt wouldn't surprise him if this fanatic cult leader decided to personally remove his head for being an unfilial wretch.\n‘Baek Cheon nearly had his limbs severed just for calling me a son of a bitch!’\nCold sweat ran down Il-mok's spine as his neck prickled with phantom pain.\nBut he couldn't just stand there waiting to be executed.\n\"Master, about me calling that old man 'master', there's been a misunderstanding...\"\nIl-mok hurried to defend himself, but the Heavenly Demon cut him off. \"I know what happened. You played the role of his disciple out of kindness to Elder Kang.\"\n\"!?\"\nIl-mok had acted as Yeong-jin purely to save his own skin, but somehow the Heavenly Demon saw it as an act of kindness toward the old man.\nCome to think of it, the Heavenly Demon had played along with their charade from the start, even calling him Yeong-jin when he appeared.\nIl-mok didn't understand why, but he recognized his lifeline when he saw it.\n\"Y-yes, exactly, Master!\"\nAt Il-mok's enthusiastic agreement, the Heavenly Demon gazed toward the pavilion with melancholy and stroked his beard with a pitying expression.\n\"Truly kind of you.\"\nThe bitter sadness in his tone made Il-mok venture a careful question. \"Do you know that old man, Master?\"\n\"Hahaha. Did Hayeon not tell you what kind of place this Peach Blossom Ridge is?\"\n\"Ah!\"\nOnly then did Il-mok realize what an idiotic question he'd just asked.\nThis place served as a retreat for the elders of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. Of course, his Master—who'd ruled as the Heavenly Demon for decades—would know everyone here.\nBefore they became like this, these people had helped lead the cult alongside him for years.\nFeeling embarrassed, Il-mok asked the Heavenly Demon. \"What kind of person was this Elder Kang?\"\n\"A capable person. The Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's side effects made him obsessively thorough, and his swordsmanship was exceptional. Everyone expected him to achieve Transcendence eventually.\" The Heavenly Demon's expression darkened. \"Until tragedy struck.\"\n\"What happened?\"\n\"When word came that his disciple had died on a mission, something inside him began to wither.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Then came strange rumors that he wandered the mountains, searching for his dead disciple. Soon after, his memory started failing.\"\n\"He must have loved that disciple deeply.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon shook his head. \"Quite the opposite. His failure to love became his eternal torment.\"\n\"???\"\nSeeing Il-mok's confusion, the Heavenly Demon elaborated. \"Elder Kang was consumed by his duties and his pursuit of mastering the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword. He never gave his disciple the attention he deserved. After Yeong-jin's death, regret ate at him daily. He convinced himself that with just a little more training, a little more guidance, his disciple would have returned alive from the mission.\"\n\"I see...\"\nNow Il-mok understood why the dementia-stricken old man forgot everything else but clung desperately to teaching him sword techniques.\nWith a heavy heart, Il-mok asked, \"What kind of person was the disciple named Yeong-jin? Seeing how Elder Kang mistakes me for him, I must have resembled him.\"\n\"You don't resemble him at all. Not even close. Yeong-jin had sharp, rugged features, nothing like yours. And he was already over thirty when he died.\"\nStrange. How could someone with no resemblance whatsoever be mistaken for another person?\nSure, Il-mok had claimed to be the disciple, but dementia alone couldn't explain such complete delusion.\n‘His longing must run that deep.’\nA grief so profound had clouded the old man's vision entirely.\nA bitter taste filled Il-mok's mouth. \"Master. Do you plan to leave this place immediately?\"\n\"I could force our way out, but there's no rush now that you're safe. The life gate opens in five days. We'll leave then.\"\nIl-mok seemed to reach some internal decision and spoke in a cautious tone. \"I know this sounds ungrateful, but... Can I stay with Elder Kang for those five days?\"\n\"You want to keep playing Yeong-jin until we leave?\"\n\"If Master permits it, I would like to do so.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon studied Il-mok thoughtfully. His fingers worked through his beard before he nodded.\n\"If you truly regarded Elder Kang as your master, it would warrant punishment. But I know this comes from genuine compassion. Very well. I shall permit it.\"\nWith the Heavenly Demon's permission, Il-mok returned to Elder Kang's side.\nTheir routine continued unchanged.\nThe old man who'd failed his first disciple threw himself into training his \"second\" one, drilling Il-mok relentlessly in the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\n\"They say the disciple will surpass the master eventually. Seeing your progress, this old man’s heart is filled with happiness. Hahaha.”\nEvery time Il-mok showed progress, the old man would rejoice with childlike raptures.\nAnd between the training sessions, Il-mok took care of him.\n\"Master, your meal is ready.\"\n\"Master, time for your bath.\"\nHe prepared food and fed the old man by hand. He heated water and gently washed the frail body, scrubbing away grime with patient care.\nAnd when the fog rolled back over Elder Kang's mind,\n\"Who the hell are you!?\"\n\"Master, I'm your disciple Yeong-jin.\"\nIl-mok had grown used to these episodes, responding with natural ease each time.\nPerhaps because he now understood Elder Kang's story, Il-mok noticed a pattern.\n‘His memory only stays clear when he's teaching Yeong-jin.’\nHow great must that regret be for him to be like this?\nSo Il-mok continued the charade, training as Yeong-jin, caring for his \"master.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon kept his distance, perhaps out of respect for Elder Kang's dignity. In a way, it was also a kind of vacation for the Heavenly Demon. Peach Blossom Ridge earned its name honestly; the scenery here was breathtaking.\nThree days after the Heavenly Demon entered the Oblivion Ridge, on the fifth night since Il-mok had been living as Yeong-jin—\nRustle. Google seaʀᴄh Nove1Fire.net\nAfter confirming Elder Kang slept soundly, Il-mok quietly slipped out from the pavilion toward the place where the Heavenly Demon was. Earlier that evening, his master had summoned him for a midnight meeting.\nAnd in the room Il-mok had left.\n\"Yeong-jin... Yeong-jin...\"\nElder Kang's arms moved restlessly as he mumbled in his sleep.\nIn his dreams, he walked with his late disciple.\n—Master. It's alright for you to forget me now.\nBut Yeong-jin was saying goodbye, preparing to leave forever.\n‘What are you talking about? How could I ever forget you?’\n—This happened because your worthless disciple lacked talent. None of it was your fault. So please, Master, let me go.\nNo! This is all on me! Come back, Yeong-jin!\n—I never blamed you, not once. So stop blaming yourself, Master.\n!!!\nAs Yeong-jin finished his last words and turned to leave, Elder Kang desperately chased after him.\nBut no matter how fast he moved his legs, his disciple's retreating figure grew smaller and smaller.\nYeong-jin! Yeong-jin!\nHe reached out frantically, trying to grab those shoulders, but the gap only widened.\n\"Yeong-jin!!\"\nThe anguished cry tore from his throat as Elder Kang's eyes snapped open.\nDarkness surrounded him.\n\"Yeong-jin?\"\nHe sat up abruptly, head swiveling as he searched for the disciple who'd been sleeping beside him.\n‘Disciple?’\nSomething was wrong.\nThe face he'd seen in his dream bore no resemblance to the face that had been caring for him these past few days.\nThe contradiction hit him like lightning.\nMemories crashed over him in overwhelming waves.\nNews of Yeong-jin's death. His slow descent into madness. Coming to Oblivion Ridge. A strange boy claiming to be his late disciple.\nFragmented and hazy, the memories reassembled themselves piece by piece.\nElder Kang quickly sat in the lotus position and began controlling the demonic energy of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword that had started to rampage.\n‘How dare he impersonate my disciple!’\nBewilderment gave way to fury. But then—\n— Stop blaming yourself, Master.\nThe words of his disciple from the dream cooled his rage.\nAnd other memories surfaced, memories of time spent with that boy who had called himself Yeong-jin. Memories of preparing meals for him and feeding him. Memories of carefully washing his body. Even memories of receiving the training he'd failed to give to the real Yeong-jin.\n‘Ah... So it’s thanks to that child.’\nTime had weathered the old man's heart like stone worn smooth by desert winds.

    "content": "Chapter 96: Volunteer Work (1)\nIl-mok had left the pavilion when the Heavenly Demon called, and now found himself talking with his master who'd been waiting beyond the trees.\n\"You wanted to see me, Master?\"\n\"We're leaving in two days, so I need to ask you something first.\"\n\"Please ask.\"\n\"How exactly did you end up coming to this place?\"\n\"I'm wondering the same thing myself. I just gave the exam my best, but somehow I ended up in this place.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nThe Heavenly Demon stroked his beard with a strange sigh, then shared what he'd discovered while searching for Il-mok.\nA tiny crack had formed in the formation array during the exam, and Il-mok had somehow slipped through that crack to end up here.\n\"While it's certainly something that could happen, what puzzles me is why you moved all the way to the edge of the test grounds.\"\nA memory stirred in Il-mok’s mind.\n\"I moved to the edge of the training ground because of the bell sounds.\"\n\"Bell sounds?\"\n\"Yes. Since I was told that getting caught by the teaching assistants and instructors would result in the lowest possible score, I kept moving to avoid the bell sounds. That naturally pushed me toward the edge. When I couldn't hear the sounds anymore, I tried to head for my destination, but somehow I ended up here at Oblivion Ridge instead.\"\n\"...Even if you lost your sense of direction while dodging the instructors, those bell sounds are highly suspicious.\"\nAccidentally stepping to the test ground's edge to avoid assistants and instructors, then getting caught in the formation.\nA hairline crack appeared in the formation, letting someone slip outside the exam area.\nWandering the Tianshan Mountain Range and stumbling into the Oblivion Ridge.\nThese disasters happened once in a blue moon.\nAny one of these things could've been a coincidence.\nBut...\n'All three disasters happening at once? The odds are basically zero.'\nIl-mok seemed to reach the same conclusion as his expression turned grave.\nThough suspicions had remained even after the Divine Guardian’s suicide last time, this made it certain.\nPeople targeting Il-mok were still lurking inside the Divine Cult.\nThe real problem was what to do about it.\n'We could interrogate all the teaching assistants and instructors who were at the exam grounds, but that would be a poor strategy.'\nFor one, there was no guarantee the interrogation would work. And if people broke under torture and spewed false information, things would only get messier.\nWithout solid evidence, the Heavenly Demon knew perfectly well that random torture was nothing but meaningless slaughter.\nWhether to increase surveillance within the Hall of the Demonic Way or prepare some other plan, the Heavenly Demon organized his thoughts and then looked at Il-mok with a peculiar look.\n“Still, you’re improving by leaps and bounds thanks to all this, so it’s not all bad, my disciple.\"\nAt this point, the Heavenly Demon found himself thinking that perhaps not catching those bastards might actually help Il-mok's growth.\n\"You're too kind, Master.\"\nIl-mok bowed respectfully, but behind that polite facade, his face was twisted in agony.\n'Shit. I'm already losing my mind as it is.'\nIt’s been five days since Il-mok began training the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword while pretending to be Elder Kang's student. Il-mok's skills were skyrocketing.\nWhen receiving training from the Heavenly Demon or at the Hall of the Demonic Way, he had some leisure to slack off.\nThe Heavenly Demon was swamped with work and couldn't spare much time for Il-mok. And at the Hall, he could laze around whenever he found an opportunity.\nBut Elder Kang? Driven by bitter resentment, he pushed Il-mok to his absolute limits.\nPlus, Il-mok's level had already climbed pretty high, which made things worse.\nAdditionally, the fact that Il-mok's realm had already risen to some degree also played a part.\nOf course, that meant the side effects hit him like a truck, and he was suffering for it.\nHe was starting to regret his request to play Elder Kang's student for the remaining five days.\nRustle.\nA faint sound came from the bushes, along with someone's presence.\n\"!?\"\nIl-mok spun around and nearly jumped out of his skin. Elder Kang who should've been fast asleep emerged from the thicket.\nThe Heavenly Demon seemed to have known of his approach and kept his expression neutral. Il-mok quickly pulled himself together and addressed Elder Kang properly.\n\"It's still the middle of the night, Master. Let's head inside so you can get some rest.\"\nBut Elder Kang's response caught him off guard.\n\"Hohoho. You don’t need to worry about me, Young Master. And you don't need to call this old fool 'Master' anymore.\"\nAlthough Elder Kang had regained his memories along with his sanity, one question still lingered in his mind.\nHow had that boy ended up at the Oblivion Ridge? And why was he pretending to be his disciple?\nEven in his hazy memories, he could swear he'd seen the Heavenly Demon.\nGrateful as he was to the boy, Elder Kang left the pavilion to follow the boy's trail and get some answers.\nThat's when he overheard the tail end of the conversation between the boy and the Heavenly Demon.\nThem calling each other master and disciple.\n'Ah, so that's how it is.'\nElder Kang pieced things together in his own way, then dropped to his knees before the Heavenly Demon in reverence.\n'All of this happened because the Heavenly Demon took pity on this worthless fool...'\nHe understood that the Heavenly Demon had deliberately sent his disciple here.\nEven going so far as to teach the boy the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\nSeeing Elder Kang bowing himself in overwhelming gratitude, the Heavenly Demon looked genuinely surprised.\n\"Rise, Elder Kang.\"\nElder Kang rose at his command. When the Heavenly Demon met his eyes, he knew for certain.\n\"Have you regained your senses?\"\nElder Kang's eyes, which until now had been clouded with murky turbidity, were now clear.\nJust as the Heavenly Demon expected, Elder Kang nodded.\n\"Indeed. Thanks to the Young Master and the Supreme One’s kindness.\"\nElder Kang also bowed to Il-mok after the Heavenly Demon, showing his gratitude.\nEven if it was done on the Heavenly Demon's orders, this boy had still taken care of him for these past few days. Even went as far as to act as his disciple to his demented self.\nThe Heavenly Demon stroked his beard with a touch of fondness at Elder Kang's calm demeanor.\n\"Hohoho. That was all my youngest disciple’s doing. What did this old man contribute?\"\n\"You're being too modest. Without the Heavenly Demon's permission, how could the Young Master have served me as his master?\" ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ novel_fіre.net\nElder Kang smiled warmly at both the Heavenly Demon and Il-mok.\nEven the Heavenly Demon found that smile unfamiliar.\n'Huh. He didn't just recover, he got better.'\nElder Kang used to be constantly on edge because of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's side effects.\nFeeling much more at ease, the Heavenly Demon spoke up.\n\"Then come with us when we leave in two days.\"\nFor some reason, Elder Kang turned down the offer.\n\"I can't do that. Although I’ve regained my sanity, there's no guarantee it'll stay that way. Besides...\"\nElder Kang looked around with a face filled with compassion.\n\"Someone needs to stay here and look after them.\"\nEveryone present immediately understood who Elder Kang was referring to.\nThose who had devoted their loyalty to the cult but were abandoned here due to dementia.\n\"You want to stay here and care for them?\"\n\"Correct, Supreme One.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nWhile the Heavenly Demon studied Elder Kang with mixed feelings, Il-mok, who had been listening to their conversation, carefully opened his mouth.\n\"Then, would it be alright if I stayed with Elder Kang, just for tomorrow?\"\n\"What for?\"\nAt the Heavenly Demon's question, Il-mok explained.\n\"I want to help take care of the elderly here.\"\nIl-mok volunteered for two reasons.\nFirst, he felt sorry for the old folks.\nSure, he'd been scared these past few days because his life was on the line. But now that things had calmed down, it was different.\n'They all looked absolutely miserable.'\nElder Kang kept his clothes and living space spotless, mostly because of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's side effects.\nBut what about the other elderly? Not so much.\nTheir clothes were caked with days' worth of dirt, dust, and sweat. Some even wandered around with piss and shit stains.\nMoreover, they couldn't even take care of their meals properly, causing their body to suffer from malnutrition.\nOf course, Il-mok knew that despite their pitiful state, they were dangerous as hell, and Il-mok would normally never dare to help them. But it’s different now that Elder Kang has regained his sanity.\nThen there is Il-mok's second reason:\n'Taking a break would be ideal, but at least, this is much better than advancing my Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.'\nHe wanted to stop training the damn thing. Thanks to Elder Kang's brutal training regimen over the past five days, his mastery of the latter form had skyrocketed.\nWhen Il-mok offered to help, Elder Kang shook his head.\n\"How could I make the Young Master do that kind of work? You've helped this old fool enough. Focus on your training for bigger things.\"\nIl-mok nearly had a panic attack as he protested.\n\"Training can be done even after leaving this place. Since we have to leave here in two days anyway, there is no harm in spending one day caring for those people. More importantly, they have all devoted their lives to the Divine Cult. How could I just turn my back on them?\"\nThe one who responded to Il-mok's answer was not Elder Kang but the Heavenly Demon.\n\"Il-mok's right. They all served the cult faithfully, so this old man should help care for them too while we're here.\"\n\"!?\"\nWhen the Heavenly Demon—the absolute pinnacle of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult—said he'd help care for dementia patients, both Il-mok and Elder Kang stared at him in shock.\nBut they weren't the most surprised.\nThe Hidden Guard Pavilion Master, who'd been as silent as a statue, dropped to his knees with a horrified expression.\n\"Absolutely not! How could the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons do such menial work—\"\nJust like his image, the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master’s voice was deep and gruff, but he couldn't finish his sentence as the Heavenly Demon cut him off.\n\"Did you not hear Il-mok's words? They all devoted themselves to the cult.\"\n\"But—\"\n\"Did you forget our doctrine? The Heavenly Demon rules all cultists and living beings. Ruling isn't just about handing out orders and punishments. Taking care of people is part of the ruler’s duty. Are you saying this old man can’t fulfil his duty as the Heavenly Demon?\"\n\"No! This humble one is a fool! Please, strike me down!\"\nThe panicked Hidden Guard Pavilion Master tried to slam his head against the ground, but it never made contact.\nInvisible energy from the Heavenly Demon held him in place.\n\"We're already shorthanded as it is. Granting you death means doing them an injustice. Thus, you shall help them with the work tomorrow, Pavilion Master.”\n\"I'll follow your orders!\"\nIl-mok listened to their intense exchange, not daring to interrupt.\nAnd that's how a volunteer service for the dementia-stricken elderly was born under the moonlight.\nEarly the next morning.\nThe volunteer crew left Elder Kang's place and got to work.\nSurprisingly, the leader of the service group was none other than Il-mok.\nThe reason is simple: the other three knew absolutely nothing about this kind of work.\n\"First, we need to secure a wide clearing near the stream. We'll gather all the elders there and manage them in one spot.\"\n\"Isn't putting them all together too risky?\"\nAt the Heavenly Demon's concern, Il-mok shook his head.\n\"If Elder Kang's going to manage all these elders by himself, keeping them scattered around won't work. Yes, there's some risk, but I have an idea how to manage it.”\nCurious about his plan, the other three followed Il-mok towards the stream.\nWhen they reached a spot about roughly 200 meters from the stream, the Heavenly Demon surveyed the area.\n\"This place seems suitable.\"\n“The distance is right, but there's no clearing here, Master.\"\nAt Il-mok's observation, the Heavenly Demon went quiet and closed his eyes.\nAfter a brief moment, he said something cryptic.\n\"I sense no presence here.\"\n\"???\"\nJust as Il-mok was about to ask what he meant—\nSwoosh!\nThe Heavenly Demon's sword appeared in his hand, sending out a massive crescent of Sword Qi that shot out in all directions and instantly obliterating everything in a perfect circle.\nOnly then did Il-mok understand the Heavenly Demon's meaning.\nThe Heavenly Demon had been checking if any wandering elders were in the blast zone.\n‘Still, even if no one was around…’\nWhile Il-mok was internally chuckling wryly at his master's over-the-top solution that defied all common sense, the Heavenly Demon acted like it was no big deal.\n\"Just clear the debris and we'll have a nice open space.\"\nAs if on cue, they heard movement in the distance.\nWild elderly figures started emerging from various directions.\n\"Who the hell did this!?\"\n\"How dare you disturb the Divine Cult's territory!\"\nThe commotion caused by the Heavenly Demon's strike had drawn them out.\nBut Il-mok wasn't worried.\nThe moment he spotted these old monsters, he realized exactly why the Heavenly Demon had stirred up this chaos.\nWhoooooosh!\nThe terrifying demonic energy of the Heavenly Demon Divine Arts began radiating from his body.\n\"We bow before the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons!!\"\nThe wild old monsters instantly transformed into devoted followers of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, dropping to the ground with reverence in their eyes.\n'What is this, some kind of fishing expedition?'\nHe'd definitely created that ruckus on purpose to round up all the old monsters.\nBut there was no time to stand around gawking. The Heavenly Demon had set the stage—now it was time to get to work.",

    "content": "Chapter 97: Volunteer Work (2)\n\"Alright, elders! Just follow my lead from now on!\"\n\"???\"\nThe elders who'd been bowing looked up at this young man addressing them out of nowhere, clearly confused.\nThe dementia care volunteers standing with Il-mok also shot him looks that practically screamed, \"What the hell are you doing?\"\nIl-mok ignored them all. He grabbed a decent-sized piece of wood from the wreckage the Heavenly Demon had created and sliced it down to size with his sword.\n\"See? You just need to cut them into pieces about this big. Easy enough, right?\"\nWhat he'd made looked like a rough wooden plank.\nFollowing Il-mok's instructions, a few elders who'd been standing around in a daze started using their martial arts to cut wood, following his example.\nWatching this scene, the Heavenly Demon frowned and questioned Il-mok.\n\"Disciple, weren't we supposed to be taking care of these people? Why are you putting them to work?\"\n\"Master, dementia is a condition that worsens the more one does nothing. Only by continuously providing new stimulation to the brain can we prevent further deterioration. It won't cure them, but it can slow the decline.\"\nIl-mok wasn't exactly an expert on dementia, but his work as a social welfare civil servant had brought him into contact with care facilities plenty of times. He'd never directly cared for dementia patients himself, but he had picked up enough knowledge from what he'd seen and heard.\n\"If these were ordinary elderly people, I naturally wouldn't make them do such difficult work. They just need to exercise their internal energy. Plus, the process of channeling energy and moving their bodies will stimulate their brains.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon considered this briefly.\nIt seemed worth trying, so he decided to trust Il-mok's judgment.\n\"By my authority as the Heavenly Demon, I command you all to follow Il-mok's instructions.\"\nAs the Heavenly Demon released waves of his demonic energy with this declaration, the elders shakily got to their feet and shuffled toward Il-mok.\nIl-mok demonstrated the wood-cutting again, and the elders began cutting in their own ways.\n\"Now, for the next step, dig the ground like this.\"\nThump. Thump.\n\"Then take a big tree and drive it into the hole you just made. Like this—\"\nThunk.\nIl-mok showed them by digging a hole and jamming a tree trunk into the ground. The elderly people started driving wooden posts into the earth beside him, one by one.\n\"Ah, this should be spaced a bit more apart. Put it right here. Perfect! You're all doing great! I knew I could count on you elders! Haha.\"\nIl-mok laughed heartily while praising them, then turned to address the dementia care volunteers who were watching.\n\"I'm going to take Elder Kang and look for the other elders who haven't made it here yet. Pavilion Master, I need you to take over for me. Please keep showing them how to cut wood and build their shelter.\"\nIl-mok's wood cutting and post driving were all preparation work for building houses. If these elders were going to live together, they'd need at least basic shelter to keep the rain off and walls to block the wind.\nOf course, four volunteers couldn't possibly build housing for dozens of elders in a single day. But with the elders pitching in, it was doable. Sure, their memory issues made them scattered and confused, but when it came to raw strength, they had plenty to spare if they used their internal energy.\nThe Pavilion Master nodded reluctantly at Il-mok's instructions. The Heavenly Demon spoke up.\n\"What should this old man do, disciple?\"\n\"Master, your role is actually the most important one. If any of the elders start getting agitated or lose control, you'll need to calm them down.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon stroked his beard thoughtfully and nodded, continuing to emit faint waves of demonic energy while keeping an eye on the elders. He knew they were staying docile because of his Heavenly Demon Divine Arts.\n\"We'll head out now.\"\nAfter Il-mok left with Elder Kang to search for more elders, the Pavilion Master cleared his throat and approached the group.\n\" Ahem. Stack these wooden planks you cut on top of each other like this. Then apply mud right here...\"\nAs someone who'd spent years assisting the Heavenly Demon, the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master knew the basics of construction, even if it was just rough shelter-building.\nIt was a strange sight.\nThe Heavenly Demon was sitting leisurely in a supervisory role while the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master, who'd only gotten roped into this because of the Heavenly Demon's involvement, was down in the trenches working alongside dementia patients.\nBut the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master didn't complain. How could he let the leader of the Divine Cult get his hands dirty with manual labor?\nStill—\n\"No, that's not right. Observe. I said to cut it here, like this.\"\n\"That's not what I meant.\"\n\" Sigh. You really think that's going to fit there?\"\nDealing with dementia patients required the patience of a saint, and veins were starting to bulge on the usually composed Hidden Guard Pavilion Master's forehead.\nFinally, his frustration boiled over.\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing!\"\n\"My thoughts exactly. What exactly are you doing, Hidden Guard Pavilion Master?\"\nIl-mok had returned with Elder Kang and several more workers—no, elders they'd rounded up from their wandering around Oblivion Ridge.\n\"These people may have dementia, but they're still human beings who deserve dignity and respect. How can you speak to them so harshly?\"\n\"Il-mok is right. Mind your tone.\"\n\"......\"\nThe Hidden Guard Pavilion Master felt his anger spike, but with the Heavenly Demon taking Il-mok's side, there was nothing he could say.\nYou know what they say? Sometimes the peacemaker is more annoying than the one picking the fight.\n'Control yourself. Control yourself. Control yourself.'\nSince that peacemaker happened to be the Heavenly Demon, the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master couldn't exactly hold a grudge.\nThis same pattern repeated several more times.\nIl-mok and Elder Kang would make rounds through Oblivion Ridge, tracking down wandering elders and bringing them back to the clearing.\n\" Sigh. Let me explain this again.\"\nThe Hidden Guard Pavilion Master found himself repeating the same instructions over and over, working alongside the elders to clear debris and salvaging useful materials to build their makeshift shelters.\nAfter about an hour of construction work and elder-hunting, Il-mok and Elder Kang had successfully gathered all the wandering elders in the clearing.\n\" Whew. Now that everyone's here, we should probably get some food into these folks.\"\nThe moment Il-mok mentioned food, several of the elders who'd been working sluggishly perked up.\n\"Food?\"\nOne elder tilted his head, seemingly unable to grasp the concept.\n\"I'm hungry.\"\nAnother had apparently regressed to childhood and was whining like a kid.\n\"Woman! Get me my rice! How long are you planning to work me like a dog!\"\nAnd one had somehow shifted into the mindset of a demanding mother-in-law.\nThe reactions were varied, but they all looked equally pitiful. Official source ıs novèlfire.net\n'If they eat with their hands in that condition, food poisoning would be the least of our worries.'\nTheir hands were caked with dirt and dust, and possibly worse things.\nIl-mok shouldered the water jar he'd brought from Elder Kang's quarters and headed for the stream. He'd deliberately chosen a clearing near water to make this easier.\nAfter filling the jar, Il-mok distributed bars of soap he'd also taken from Elder Kang's place to Elder Kang and the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master.\n\"We'll wash everyone's hands first, then we can feed them.\"\nHe would have loved to give them full baths since their clothes and bodies were filthy, but they hadn't finished the shelters yet. For now, hand-washing before meals would have to do.\nThe Heavenly Demon watched Il-mok, the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master, and Elder Kang washing the elders' hands, then spoke up.\n\"Disciple.\"\n\"Yes, Master.\"\n\"Hand those over.\"\n\"???\"\nBefore Il-mok could process what was happening, the gourd and soap floated out of his hands and drifted through the air to the Heavenly Demon.\nThe Heavenly Demon had casually demonstrated his telekinesis ability. He moved to the water jar and began washing the elders' hands himself.\n\"M-Master? You're already doing plenty just keeping them calm with your Heavenly Demon Divine Arts...\"\n\"Come now, what's wrong with washing the hands of people who've served the cult faithfully? I can manage this much while maintaining my technique.\"\nAs the Heavenly Demon washed their hands, something incredible happened.\n\"I'll remember this kindness for the rest of my life.\"\n\"Long live the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons!!\"\n\"Long live! Long live!!\"\nEvery elder whose hands the Heavenly Demon washed burst into tears of gratitude.\nTheir memories might be gone, but their reverence for the Heavenly Demon was burned deep into their bodies and minds.\nIl-mok watched this almost cult-like display in fascination until he felt eyes boring into the back of his head. He turned to find the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master glaring at him with murderous intent.\n'Great.'\nApparently, the man wasn't thrilled that Il-mok had gotten the Heavenly Demon involved in manual labor.\nIl-mok clicked his tongue and busied himself with other tasks.\n\"Everyone who's had their hands washed, come this way! Elder, over here! Careful now!\"\nIl-mok began distributing food to the clean-handed elders, fruit they'd gathered while searching Oblivion Ridge, and simple provisions from Elder Kang's quarters.\nAfter their basic meal, the construction work resumed with about twenty elders pitching in.\nRepeating instructions was just part of the job now.\n\"Hey! Who are you people!\"\n\"How dare you trespass on Divine Cult territory!\"\nThe occasional outbursts where they'd suddenly get aggressive were actually the easier situations to handle since the Heavenly Demon's energy would quickly settle them down.\n\"I need to go potty.\"\n\"It's hard. Bad uncle! Stop being mean to me.\"\nBut then there were those who mentally regressed to toddler level and started whining.\n\"...Oh no.\"\nSome went beyond whining and soiled their pants.\nIl-mok separated these cases and fetched fresh water from the stream to clean them up.\n'These are probably the severe cases.'\nDementia progresses through different stages, including mild, moderate, and severe. Even if they weren't technically moderate cases, anyone who'd regressed this far mentally needed special handling. If their minds had reverted to infant-level, they probably couldn't safely use internal energy anymore.\n'Ugh.'\nFor someone with Il-mok's hygiene obsessions, cleaning elderly people who'd soiled themselves was absolutely torturous.\nHe fought down his nausea while washing the severe patients who'd become like babies, then brought them to the Heavenly Demon.\n\"Master, these people aren't in any condition to do physical work right now. Could you keep an eye on them and maybe keep them company?\"\n\"Keep them company? I'm not sure I'd know how to talk to them.\"\nSeeing the Heavenly Demon's uncertainty about how to communicate, Il-mok offered some guidance.\n\"Just think of them as small children. You could teach them basic characters like Heaven (天) or Earth (地).\"\n\"Ah, that would help restore old memories while stimulating their brains. So it's killing two birds with one stone.\"\nUnderstanding Il-mok's plan, the Heavenly Demon began teaching the regressed patients simple characters. He used his sword to write in the dirt, showing them how the characters were pronounced, and encouraged them to copy what he had done.\nWhile the Heavenly Demon worked with the children, Il-mok started a new project. He gathered scattered wood pieces, cut them into small blocks with his sword, and began carving designs into each piece.\nThe Heavenly Demon glanced over at Il-mok's handiwork and nodded knowingly.\n\"Making mahjong tiles?\"\n\"Exactly, Master. Gambling might be harmful when money's involved, but the mental exercise of remembering rules and matching patterns should be great for their condition.\"\nBack in Korea, people said hanafuda were good therapy for dementia patients, and care facilities actually used card games and pattern-matching as regular activities. But since these elders would be more familiar with mahjong than flower cards, Il-mok was sticking with what they know.\n\"Hohoho. If it's a game that stimulates the brain, this would be more effective than mahjong.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon made this cryptic comment while channeling his Heavenly Demon Divine Arts. Dense waves of demonic energy flowed from him as he used his telekinetic ability to pull over large stones and tree trunks from around the clearing.\nThen the Heavenly Demon flashed his sword at the airborne materials.\nClatter clatter clatter.\nA perfectly square wooden table appeared, complete with carved grid lines, along with dozens of perfectly round black and white stones.\nWatching his master instantly create a complete go set, Il-mok stared blankly back and forth between the Heavenly Demon and his own pile of wood scraps.\n'...Could've helped me out with mine too. Show-off.'\nIl-mok couldn't help feeling a little put out.",

    "content": "Chapter 98: Volunteer Work (3)\nWhile Il-mok was busy making gaming pieces, the Heavenly Demon spent his time teaching letters to the more severely affected patients. Meanwhile, the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master and Elder Kang kept working on construction with the other elders.\nAfter pushing through half a day of non-stop building, they'd managed to put together five decent huts. The whole thing was basically like assembling prefabricated structures, and only the elders' incredible martial arts skills made such lightning-fast progress possible.\nBy the time the sky started turning that deep crimson color...\n\"Alright everyone! Exercise time's over, let's get cleaned up and grab some food!\"\nFinally, they could wrap up the day's work and start cleaning up.\nBut honestly? Bathing twenty elderly folks with dementia was just as exhausting as the construction work had been.\nAt least they'd already gotten a few of them washed earlier, so that was something.\nWhile Il-mok, Elder Kang, and the Heavenly Demon handled bathing duty, the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master slipped away from the clearing to forage for fruit and hunt some game for dinner.\nBeing the Heavenly Demon's right-hand man meant being ready for anything—the guy really was a jack-of-all-trades.\nOnce they'd finished the baths and evening meal, Peach Blossom Ridge had gone completely dark.\n\" Snooore... \"\n\" Zzzzz... \"\nEven though it was barely evening, several elders had already fallen fast asleep. After a full day of hard labor starting from dawn, plus a good meal and bath, they looked pretty content.\nA few others were still up, playing games by the flickering light of Il-mok's campfire.\n\"You sneaky bastard, trying to cheat me!\" ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ novel•fire.net\n\"Ha! Look who's talking! You were the one trying to pull a fast one!\"\nOf course, when people's memories come and go, game time could turn into outburst time pretty quickly.\n\"Easy now.\"\nWhen the Heavenly Demon let just a wisp of his energy flow out with a gentle scolding, they immediately settled down.\nBefore long, even the game players started nodding off and drifted to sleep.\nAfter getting all the sleeping elders tucked into their respective huts...\n\" Whew. \"\nIl-mok dragged his tired body over to the campfire, where Elder Kang, the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master, and the Heavenly Demon were all staring into the flames.\nThey all had the same look on their faces of a weird mix of bone-deep exhaustion and genuine satisfaction.\nIl-mok had seen that expression before. It was the kind of face people made after finishing volunteer work.\n\"You've all worked hard.\"\nAt his master's praise, Il-mok clasped his hands and bowed.\n\"I'm sorry for dragging you into such troublesome work, Master.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon shook his head.\n\"Don't be. I've been carrying guilt about the people I sent to this place for far too long. If I'm being completely honest, I'm wondering if doing this kind of work for just one day is nothing more than cheap hypocrisy, an attempt to ease that guilt.\"\nThis was a side of the Heavenly Demon that Il-mok had never seen before. There was real regret in his expression, something deeper than just surface concern.\nHis eyes were fixed on the red glow of the campfire, but his mind seemed to be looking much further back.\n'...Only about twenty remain.'\nIn all the decades since becoming the Heavenly Demon, he'd sent way more than twenty elders to this place.\nBut today, they'd only cared for around twenty people. So where had all the others gone?\nIt wasn't a matter that required deep contemplation.\nWhile he was lost in thoughts about all those he'd turned away—too busy with his duties as Heavenly Demon, claiming there were no solutions—his disciple's voice snapped him back to the present.\n\"But isn't hypocrisy still better than nothing?\"\n\"Hypocrisy better than nothing...\"\n\"That's right, Master. Most people live exactly like that. They don't help others because they're genuinely good people. They do it because helping makes them feel good about themselves, or because they want others to think they're virtuous, or maybe just because they felt sorry for someone in the moment. But there's no point in judging them for it. Hypocritical help is still infinitely better than no help at all.\"\nIt happened all the time in the modern world too.\nMany companies donated money to reduce their tax bills or enhance their public image, then made sure everyone knew about it.\nSome people called them hypocrites, but Il-mok's perspective was different—he'd worked as a social welfare civil servant, after all.\nThose hypocritical donors were still way more useful than the ones who just pocketed money without giving anything back.\nThe Heavenly Demon considered Il-mok's words for a moment before responding.\n\"But I'm the Heavenly Demon, I rule over the entire Demonic Cult. How can I care for my people through hypocrisy?\"\n\"Indeed. You're the Heavenly Demon who has to look after everyone. Perhaps spending time directly washing and feeding people like this isn't the most effective use of your time. But because you're the Heavenly Demon, there are things only you can accomplish, right, Master?\"\nAfter thinking it over briefly, the Heavenly Demon caught on to what his disciple was getting at.\n\"You mean like the Pure Mind Hall and the school program?\"\n\"Exactly, Master.\"\nLeaders didn't need to be down in the trenches doing manual labor.\nOnce or twice to get a feel for the situation? That’s fine. But making it a regular thing was just a waste of time.\nWhat real leaders needed to do wasn't put on shows at work sites. They needed to create laws and systems that would actually help people more effectively on the ground.\n\"Then, what should be done to better care for the elders here?\"\nIl-mok's answer came in a long, detailed explanation.\n\"First off, it's impossible for Elder Kang to handle twenty people by himself. We need more manpower. I know there's already a unit that’s assigned to the Peach Blossom Ridge. Instead of having them just watch the place, we should turn them into caregivers.\"\nIl-mok was drawing on memories from his previous life as Seo Ji-hun—all those times he'd dealt with dementia care facilities while working in social services.\n\"And we need to do more of what we did today. Keep the elders together and provide them with consistent work or entertainment to keep their bodies and minds active. If you just let dementia patients sit around doing nothing, you're only making things worse.\"\nOf course, he couldn't just copy modern methods wholesale. Il-mok had to adapt that information to work in this time and place.\n\"We also need to observe each patient and keep detailed records. Particularly, we should divide patients by severity into mild and moderate cases. Those with severe dementia symptoms should focus on simple games and learning letters, while those who are doing better can handle group activities like today's work. Additionally, it's important to identify the cycles when each patient's dementia symptoms weaken or strengthen.\"\nHis goal was to transform this place from Oblivion Ridge into what it should be.\nA real sanctuary for the elders.\nOf course, his obsessive-compulsive tendencies were working overtime here.\n‘Damn it, once I start something, I can't just half-ass it!’\nHe might procrastinate, but once he began something, he couldn't do anything halfway.\n\"Another important thing is helping them remember who they are. The main headquarters keeps records on all the elders, right? We should use those records to put up information tablets in the huts and any new buildings we construct. Give the elders something they can read every day to remind themselves who they are, where they are, and how they should behave.\"\nIl-mok had even borrowed ideas from a movie he'd seen about a guy who lost his memory every single day and how he managed to function.\nWhat started as genuine compassion for the dementia patients had gotten hijacked by his Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's obsessive side effects, and Il-mok just kept going and going.\nHe'd reached the point where he was basically vomiting up entire institutional frameworks while being completely oblivious to the fact that...\n‘Our youngest really is something else.’\n‘Good lord... I had no idea the Young Master was this sharp.’\n‘Setting aside that the Heavenly Demon chooses him, how does someone so young come up with ideas like this?’\nThe expressions on the faces of the Heavenly Demon, Hidden Guard Pavilion Master, and Elder Kang kept shifting as they watched Il-mok.\nThe next morning, their makeshift dementia care team was up bright and early, bustling around to take care of the elders.\nGetting breakfast ready and making sure everyone ate, giving them light work to keep their bodies and minds engaged, and cleaning up after those who had accidents or suddenly reverted to acting like children.\nOn top of that, they helped with go and mahjong games, just spending time together...\n\"It's time to return now.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon checked the position of the sun and made the call.\nWhile the Heavenly Demon, Hidden Guard Pavilion Master, and Il-mok got ready to leave, Elder Kang bowed deeply to them.\n\"Safe travels, Lord of Ten Thousand Demons.\"\n\"I'm sorry to leave you with this burden when you're still recovering yourself.\"\n\"Please don't say that. The kindness the Heavenly Demon has shown me is more than I could repay in ten lifetimes.\"\nAfter finishing his conversation with the Heavenly Demon, Elder Kang turned to Il-mok with a formal bow.\n\"Travel safely, Young Master. I'll never forget what you've done for me.\"\n\"Take care of yourself.\"\nIl-mok returned the bow, and they finished their farewells.\nThe three of them headed across Peach Blossom Ridge toward the spot where the Illusory Dream Formation's life gate would open.\nSince the gate only stayed open for exactly one hour at the designated time, missing it meant waiting several more days.\nLuckily, it opened shortly after they arrived, and they managed to get out of Peach Blossom Ridge.\nWhen they emerged through the life gate, they found dozens of people waiting for them.\nArray Master An Hyo-gyun from the Eight Trigrams Hall was there in case anything went wrong with the formation, along with the martial artists from the unit that normally managed Oblivion Ridge.\n\"Master! Youngest!\"\nAnd for some reason, First Disciple Wi Jin-hak was there too.\n\"Jin-hak, what are you doing here?\"\n\"I'm sorry, Master. I just couldn't sit around waiting for news anymore, so I came out here.\"\nWi Jin-hak answered his master's question, then looked at Il-mok with obvious relief.\nEver since hearing that Il-mok had gone missing, Wi Jin-hak had been itching to join the search.\nThe only thing that kept him at his post was the Heavenly Demon's orders to focus on his assigned duties.\nBut he figured coming out just to meet them when they returned had to be okay, right?\n\"Greetings, Eldest Brother. Sorry for making you worry.\"\n\"Ha! As long as you're safe, that's all that matters.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon watched the exchange between his first and youngest disciples with a warm expression before addressing Il-mok.\n\"Normally, disciples from the Hall of the Demonic Way aren't allowed to leave the premises. Now that you're out of Peach Blossom Ridge, Il-mok, you need to return to the Hall immediately.\"\nIl-mok quickly bowed to his master, keeping his head down to hide his expression of pure frustration.\n‘Seriously? After all that work, I can't even get one day to rest?’\nHis hopes were crushed.\n\"Just to be safe, escort Il-mok back to the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon gave instructions to the martial artists who'd been monitoring Peach Blossom Ridge.\nLooking at the approaching martial artists, Il-mok sighed quietly and handed over the bundle of wooden tablets he'd been carrying.\n\"This is what I put together based on our discussion last night.\"\nThe tablets contained detailed instructions for the people who'd be taking over caregiving duties at Peach Blossom Ridge.\nIl-mok's obsessive tendencies had kicked into high gear after their conversation, and he simply couldn't leave it at just talking.\n‘Damn perfectionism.’\nSince verbal instructions could become garbled during transmission, Il-mok took the time to document everything by carving text into wooden tablets with his sword.\n‘Damn Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.’\nAnd because using too many tablets would make them heavy to carry, he'd painstakingly carved tiny, precise characters into each one.\nIt wasn't hard to do, thanks to the skill improvements he'd gained from Elder Kang's brutal training. Actually, the process of carving such small letters kept making his swordsmanship even more refined, which was driving him nuts.\n‘ Damn body .’\nNo matter how he looked at it, he'd definitely possessed the wrong body. His talent was ridiculously over the top to the point that every time he did something, some kind of enlightenment would hit, and his martial arts would level up.\n‘Though this talent is what kept Master from killing me and made him take me as a disciple instead. Son of a bitch! If only those crazy Murim Alliance bastards hadn't attacked in the first place!’\nCome to think of it, this whole mess started because of that son of a bitch Murim Alliance attack.\n’I'm definitely getting payback. Those Flying Dragon Corps pieces of shit.’\nIf one traced back to the very beginning, it all started because the Heavenly Demon decided to stop at that inn. But Il-mok had zero intention of seeking revenge against his master.\nNot because he respected the guy or anything.\nThe man was a complete monster. Il-mok wouldn't dare even talk back to him, let alone think about revenge.\nHuman nature being what it is, people tend to direct their anger at targets they can actually handle.",

    "content": "Chapter 99: Volunteer Work (4)\nShortly after Il-mok departed for the Hall of the Demonic Way with his martial escort.\nWi Jin-hak gestured toward something in the Heavenly Demon's hands.\n\"Master, what might that be?\"\nWhat he pointed to was the bundle of wooden tablets that Il-mok had handed to the Heavenly Demon.\nThe Heavenly Demon studied the tablets with a distant expression, as if lost in memory. After a moment, he recounted the events at Peach Blossom Ridge to Wi Jin-hak.\nNaturally, his account concluded with Il-mok's proposed reforms for the ridge.\n\"From now on, your duties extend beyond mere surveillance of Peach Blossom Ridge. You'll enter directly to care for the elders.\"\nWith those words, the Heavenly Demon handed Il-mok's wooden tablets to the Black Tortoise Corps’s Leader.\nThe members of the Black Turtle Corps who had been watching the entire situation from the side nearly turned pale in an instant.\nInstead of simply monitoring the infamous Oblivion Ridge from afar, they would now venture inside to tend to those old madmen.\n\"W-we humbly accept your command!\"\nOf course, as devoted fanatics, none dared voice objection to the Heavenly Demon's orders.\nThe Black Turtle Corps Leader bowed deeply, concealing his ashen complexion as he frantically scanned through Il-mok's written instructions.\nWi Jin-hak, who had been sneaking glances at those wooden tablets from the side, soon burst out in admiration.\n\"As expected of our youngest, Master.\"\nHow could someone so young devise such an intricate and thoughtful system?\nWi Jin-hak felt certain of one thing.\n'If that child becomes my successor...'\nTogether, they could achieve greatness that would echo through the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's history.\nMeanwhile, the Black Turtle Corps Leader's face grew increasingly grim as he absorbed Il-mok's detailed plans.\nAbout an hour later, they arrived at the main headquarters and dispersed to their respective duties.\nThose who had been in charge of monitoring the Peach Blossom Ridge began preparing to execute Il-mok's strategy under the Heavenly Demon's orders.\nAround the same time, Jin Hayeon maintained her usual routine at the Hidden Guard Pavilion, absorbed in training.\n'I must clear these wandering thoughts.'\nHowever, due to her worry about Il-mok, she couldn't easily focus on her training.\n\"Such distraction ill befits one who has mastered the White Hand Demonic Art.\"\nDam Bin, the pavilion's first squad leader, approached with a knowing expression.\n\"Forgive me.\"\n\"It's fine. Today I have good news for you. Take a rest for a moment before starting again.\"\n\"Has the Young Master returned safely?\"\n\"Oho? At the mention of good news, your thoughts immediately turn to him?\"\n\"Today marks his promised return. What other good news could there be?\"\nJin Hayeon struggled to maintain her expressionless face, but Dam Bin's smile only widened at her carefully neutral response.\n\"Come to think of it, the Pavilion Master who accompanied the Supreme One made an interesting observation about the Young Master.\"\n\"???\"\n\"He believes our youngest Young Master is growing into someone truly worthy of our service.\"\n\"!!!\"\nComing from that notoriously taciturn Pavilion Master, such words carried immense weight.\nJin Hayeon's lips curved upward despite trying her best to maintaing her composed face. Her recognition of Il-mok’s worth had found validation in the Pavilion Master's acknowledgment.\nWhile Jin Hayeon trained with renewed peace of mind, having shed her worries about Il-mok...\n\"Move quickly! We must be ready and enter the Oblivion—No, the Peach Blossom Ridge by today!”\nThe Black Tortoise Corps, who had been tasked with monitoring Peach Blossom Ridge, were running around frantically as if their asses were on fire.\nExecuting Il-mok's written plans required extensive preparation. They scoured records for information on surviving elders while gathering supplies mentioned in the tablets; they had to run all over every corner of the headquarters.\nTheir desperate efforts paid off.\nThey were able to prepare at least the bare minimum necessities in just over one hour.\nThe leader addressed several members.\n\"You remain here. When those who were left to escort the Young Master return, join them and enter Peach Blossom Ridge in six days. Following the Young Master, divide into two groups and take turns caring for the elders whenever the life gate opens.\"\nThe Black Tortoise Corps Leader's teeth ground audibly as he emphasized the \"Young Master\" part.\nLeaving a dozen members behind, the leader departed for Peach Blossom Ridge with the remaining twenty.\nUsing the map left by the Heavenly Demon, they navigated the ridge's interior and soon reached the elders' gathering place.\n\"We greet the Lord of Peach Blossom Ridge.\"\n\"Lord of Peach Blossom Ridge? What nonsense is this?\"\nWhen Elder Kang asked with a puzzled expression, the Black Tortoise Corps Leader answered.\n\"By the Supreme One’s solemn decree, he has appointed Elder Kang as the Lord of the Peach Blossom Ridge and ordered us to follow the Lord's instructions.\"\nHaving said this, the leader presented the wooden tablets Il-mok had prepared to Elder Kang. Those wooden tablets could be called a kind of guidebook for the Lord of Peach Blossom Ridge and for themselves to follow.\nAfter securing the tablets safely, they began moving according to the instructions on the tablets.\n\"Honored elders, please gather here.\"\n\"Now, do you see that hut over there? You need to build like that. First, dig the ground like this...\"\nSeveral unit members collaborated with the more lucid elders to build shelters, just as the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master had done in the past.\nOthers were caring for the elders in the worst condition.\nTeaching basic characters or bathing those who had lost control of their bodily functions.\nThe remaining members handled various miscellaneous tasks.\nThey brought the records they had gathered and wrote down the elders' personal information.\n· This place is Peach Blossom Ridge.\n· After coughing, please wash your hands.\nThey also posted papers with written instructions in various spots around the huts and clearing so the elders could regain their senses and understand their daily routine.\nThese reminders helped elders orient themselves upon regaining clarity.\n\"Phew. Why did I say I was good at drawing...\" one member muttered, constantly sketching pictures on the small wooden boards.\n\"What kind of game is this? How did the Young Master think up such a game?\" another wondered, bending iron rods brought from the main headquarters and driving them into various spots around the clearing.\nOf course, during this process, there were cases where elders would suddenly lose their minds and go berserk.\n\"Who are you people?!\"\nElder Kang, the unit members, and partially coherent elders would unite to subdue their rampaging companions.\nAfter completing afternoon duties, the personnel were divided again.\nThe somewhat lucid elders received washing supplies and were instructed to wash themselves, while the less fortunate others were handled by the assigned unit.\nFollowing dinner came a rest period.\nThe elderly who had regressed to infancy were cared for by Black Tortoise Corps members who taught them simple characters.\n\"Now, look at these wooden pieces. They have pictures and characters written on them! The person who matches the most pictures and characters that match wins.\"\nUsing the wooden boards made by the Black Tortoise Corps member who had been drawing like crazy, they conducted a kind of picture-matching game.\nOthers enjoyed mahjong or go sets that Il-mok and the Heavenly Demon had previously introduced.\nIn one corner of the clearing, another of Il-mok's innovations took shape—courtesy of the hard-working members of the Black Tortoise Corps.\n\"Look here, there are gates numbered from one (一) to ten (十). Form two teams and take turns striking the ball through each gate with these mallets. It’s quite simple.”\nThe game Il-mok had conceived for the elders was gateball. He had recalled how popular it was among the Korean senior citizens.\n\"Gate sequence doesn't matter, but the first team to pass through all gates wins, and you must remember which gates your team has passed through.\"\nTruth be told, Il-mok knew little about actual gateball rules. Having never played himself, he improvised the rules so it could be suitable for elderly enjoyment.\n\"Oho. What an interesting game!\"\nDespite their clouded minds, the novelty sparked the interest of several elders in gateball.\nThe unit members, exhausted from their charges' demands, felt gratified as they watched the elders enjoy mahjong, go, picture-matching games, and gateball on their own.\n'We feared them because we thought they were completely unreasonable, but our ignorance blinded us.'\n'To devise such care for those who served the cult so faithfully, he truly is extraordinary.'\nManaging occasional outbursts or childish regression proved challenging, but the elders remained relatively coherent most of the time.\nThe papers posted around the hut and personal information sheets proved invaluable. When the elders emerged from confused states, these references helped them regain composure and understanding.\nWhile the unit members and Elder Kang basked in satisfaction—\n\"Ahahaha. Your team has already passed three gates!\"\n\"Lying scoundrel! This is our first attempt!\"\nThe elders who had been enjoying gateball suddenly got into a fight, their mallets crackling with demonic energy as they swung at each other.\n\"I wanna go home...\"\nThe unit members sighed wearily and rushed to separate the elders.\nSuch would be daily life at the Peach Blossom Ridge.\nWhile the Black Tortoise Corps was moving busily thanks to the bombshell Il-mok had dropped...\nIl-mok arrived at the Hall of the Demonic Way with his assigned escorts.\n'Thankfully, it's afternoon.'\nIt was around the time when classes would have concluded, allowing him to report his return and rest immediately.\n'Thanks to going berserk once, it has calmed down a bit, but let's rest for now.'\nLast night's intensive planning session for the Peach Blossom Ridge had temporarily eased the side effects of his Demonic Art.\nBut this reprieve was only temporary. It could worsen again at any time, so physical and mental stability were more important than anything.\nReaching the Hall's main gate, Il-mok noticed the instructor's startled reaction.\n\"I-I'll open the gate immediately. Please wait.\"\nThe man's expression suggested he'd seen a ghost. Clearly, he'd expected Il-mok never to return alive.\nAfter operating the mechanism to lift the heavy gate, the instructor offered guidance.\n\"Once you go inside, report to Instructor Chu Il-hwan first, then rest.\"\n\"Understood.\"\nAs Il-mok concluded his conversation, his escorts paid their respects to him.\n\"Young Master, we will return to the headquarters now.\"\nOnce alone, Il-mok passed through the open gate into the Hall's interior.\nSimilar reactions greeted him as he strode throughout the facility.\nThose training in the martial arts hall looked at Il-mok with a face that looked like they had seen a ghost in daylight.\nIl-mok's assessment was straightforward after surveying the scene.\n'They've returned as expected.'\nThe Hall housed not only his peers but also senior students.\n\"Disciple Il-mok!\"\nSome rushed toward him upon recognition, like Bang Mi-hwa and Dokgo Pae.\n'Troublesome.'\nWith his condition's side effects still lingering, engaging these tiresome individuals would prove exhausting. Il-mok deflected their approach.\n\"I need to make a return report, so come find me later.\"\nHe strode briskly toward the instructors' office, successfully evading the persistent students.\nHis swift movement allowed him to reach the office quickly.\nIl-mok's sudden appearance evoked familiar reactions from the instructors, expressions of someone a ghost in daylight.\nAmid the stares, Chu Il-hwan regarded him with a curious expression.\n\"You actually survived?\"\n\"What? Hoping for the otherwise?\"\nIl-mok had that thought.\nMaybe this guy had orchestrated the bell sounds that lured him toward the crack in the formation.\nChu Il-hwan chuckled at the blunt response.\n\"Hahaha. What strange words. I was genuinely concerned, you know? You entered the notorious Oblivion Ridge, after all. Honestly, even I, as an instructor, wouldn't be confident about surviving there.\"\nIl-mok clicked his tongue inwardly and replied, \"It's called the Peach Blossom Ridge, Instructor. Master said to no longer call it by the old name. Looks like word hasn't reached this place yet.\"\nThe mention of the Heavenly Demon immediately sobered Chu Il-hwan and the listening instructors.\n\"I see. I'll be careful from now on.\"\nChu Il-hwan's uncharacteristically serious tone deepened Il-mok's suspicions, though he kept them hidden.\nRevealing his doubts now would only make catching the culprit more difficult. Better to maintain the pretense for now.\nUnaware of Il-mok's inner thoughts, Chu Il-hwan adopted a grave expression.

Oh, and...\"\nChu Il-hwan, who had suddenly stopped speaking, soon wore his characteristic playful expression again and added.\n\"While it's unfortunate that you were involved in a dangerous accident, since you ventured beyond the examination boundaries into that formation, your last exam is a failure.\"\n\".......\"",

    "content": "Chapter 100: Volunteer Work (5)\nIl-mok's expression of disbelief might as well have been invisible to Chu Il-hwan, who continued beaming with that insufferably cheerful smile.\n\"What else can we do? A test is a test; it must be fair, wouldn't you agree? I'm sure you'll perform well enough in the next exam, so don't trouble yourself over this.\"\nChu Il-hwan even had the gall to clench his fist in what appeared to be genuine encouragement.\nIl-mok responded with an audible sigh this time.\n\"Yes. I'll take my leave.\"\nThe moment Il-mok left the office, he activated his stealth technique and moved with caution. The last thing he needed was to catch the attention of lunatics the likes of Bang Mi-hwa, Dokgo Pae, or Mak Ho-yeol.\n‘Any of those three would spell trouble.’\nHis recent torment under Elder Kang had sharpened his abilities, but that also made facing Bang Mi-hwa directly all the more dangerous. Getting into fights or listening to nonsense from guys like Dokgo Pae and Mak Ho-yeol would also be tiresome in many ways.\nIl-mok's destination remained unchanged: that familiar, secluded clearing where he always lazed around. He planned to disappear into its deep shadows and finally catch his breath.\nAfter moving stealthily with his stealth technique pushed to the limit, Il-mok was able to reach the clearing without being spotted by those crazy bastards.\nThen he stopped dead and rubbed his eyes.\nThere sat Jeong Hyeon, hunched over like a frightened animal, forcing out the most awkward laugh he'd ever heard.\n\"Ahaha... hahaha...\"\nEven stranger, Baek Cheon stood beside him giving Jeong Hyeon some strange teaching.\n\"No, no. That's not it! That's all wrong. UHAHAHAHAHAHA!! You need to do deep breathing like this!\"\nIl-mok wondered if the side effects of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword had worsened, making him see hallucinations.\nSeveral days earlier, around the time Il-mok had just gone missing.\nThe senior disciples of the Hall of the Demonic Way were touring the Xinjiang region with the White Tiger Corps as part of their practical training.\nThe White Tiger Corps's mission was straightforward: patrol the Xinjiang area and eliminate bandits and other scum. But after more than twenty days together, tomorrow would mark the end of their assignment and their return to the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nPerhaps because they had become somewhat comfortable after spending over twenty days together, the White Tiger Corps members and Hall disciples now conversed with surprising ease.\n\"So, how do you find working with the White Tiger Corps?\"\n\"Ever think about joining us after you finish at the Hall?\"\nSome were bold enough to recruit the disciples openly. Others had grown comfortable enough to ask personal inquiries.\n\"Speaking of which, it's been quite some time since the youngest Young Master entered the Hall. How is he doing?\"\nSince the youngest young master had accumulated various achievements even before entering the Hall of the Demonic Way, they couldn't help but be curious.\nBefore anyone could respond—\nSnap!\nA fan opened with a theatrical flourish.\n\"HAHAHAHA! What an excellent question, senior!\"\nBaek Cheon's fake boisterous laughter cut through the air as he suddenly stepped into the center and began speaking.\nSilence descended over the area. Every eye turned toward him, but not with the expression of people wondering what was wrong with this madman.\nInstead, they all shook their heads in weary resignation.\nThey had already experienced more than enough of this crazy bastard's antics over the past twenty days.\nHis peers had been giving him the cold shoulder ever since his \"mistake\". Word had even spread to the White Tiger Corps during their training.\nBut Baek Cheon didn't care.\n\"Senior, have you ever experienced something like opera?\"\n\"When we visit the next village, can we see a performance?\"\nHe didn't care whether others cursed him or gave him the cold shoulder. Only his newfound obsession with ‘opera’ consumed his attention, and he bombarded the White Tiger Corps members with endless questions.\nHis shameless persistence had actually yielded results. He'd managed to extract stories about theatrical arts and even witnessed an actual performance in one village. He'd even cornered the performers afterward, pestering them for teaching him until they taught him something.\nEver since that day, every conversation followed the same pattern.\nSwish!\n\"The Eighth Young Master! His brilliance reaches the heavens—show him one thing, and he grasps ten!\"\nHe flourished his fan like a prop, speaking in the tones of a stage actor while spouting increasingly ridiculous praise.\nThe spectacle of Baek Cheon's one-man show continued, his Il-mok worship reaching new heights of absurdity.\n\"Was he always like this when he first joined the Hall?\" A member of the White Tiger Corps asked a nearby disciple.\nThe disciple's reply came with visible reluctance. \"Originally, he was just an arrogant brat. Nothing like... this. He changed after receiving that punishment, senior.\"\n\"The punishment for his fight with the youngest Young Master?\"\n\"That’s correct, senior.\"\n\"Strange. For someone who was punished by him, he seems to hold the Young Master in unusually high regard...\"\n\".......\"\nThe remark left the disciple speechless. Even now, Baek Cheon, who had taken center stage, was continuing his praise of Il-mok.\nAfter watching the display, the disciple sighed. \"Honestly, I think he's just lost his mind.\"\n\"Ah.\" The White Tiger Corps member who had been watching Baek Cheon nodded as if he understood his junior's plight.\nThe following day brought their parting with the White Tiger Corps.\nUnder the instructors’ supervision, the disciples made their way back to the Hall of the Demonic Way, arriving by evening.\nAnd they encountered shocking news.\nThe youngest young master had gone missing. Worse, he'd likely wandered into the Oblivion Ridge.\nMore shocking still: tomorrow morning, the Heavenly Demon himself would venture into that place to search for him.\nDespite news of the Heavenly Demon's personal intervention, most faces showed only grim resignation. No matter how skilled that Eighth Young Master was, they thought surviving two days in the terrible place called the Oblivion Ridge would be impossible.\n\"HAHAHAHA! The Young Master is about to make history once again!\"\nBaek Cheon's theatrical proclamation cut through the somber atmosphere like a blade, completely oblivious to—or rather, uncaring about—the mood.\nEveryone around him recoiled, shaking their heads and distancing themselves.\n\"Hmph. Fools. I’ll savor your expression when you see his return.”\nWhen that glorious moment arrived, he would regale them all with songs and performances celebrating the young master's triumph!\n'Ah! Inspiration is flowing! I can already see their faces moved to tears by my songs and plays, focusing their eyes on me!’\nBaek Cheon trembled with anticipation at his own fantasies. Those who had already retreated frowned and put even more distance between themselves and the madman.\nBut Baek Cheon paid them no mind.\n\"Magnificent! Truly magnificent!\"\nHe continued his practice, babbling and singing while rehearsing the grand performance he'd someday present to adoring crowds.\nThat afternoon, after returning from their extended training, he'd claimed the center of the practice grounds and spent the entire day rehearsing, blind to others' stares. The next day is no different; he occupied the same spot and continued his theatrical shouting.\nNaturally, everyone avoided him and kept a safe distance. But Baek Cheon remained convinced that someday, somehow, they would all acknowledge his presence.\nDuring a brief pause in his passionate training, as he cleared his throat—\n\"Ahem. Um...\"\n\"Excuse me... senior...\"\nA timid voice barely reached his ears.\nBaek Cheon turned to find a fellow disciple standing roughly ten feet away, looking at him anxiously with furtive glances.\nThat anxious demeanor told him everything he needed to know.\n‘Oh, she's clearly smitten with me.’\nFor someone who thrived on attention, discovering he'd already gained a devoted follower sent waves of euphoria through him.\nBaek Cheon, trying to hide his joy, asked while pretending to be cool.\n\"Hmm. Yes. What is it?\"\nThe junior disciple, Jeong Hyeon, crept closer with a trembling voice.\n\"Pl-pl-please teach m-e!\"\nJeong Hyeon was so nervous that her voice even cracked at the end.\n\"Aha! I see you've also developed an interest in the theatrical arts! Hahaha. Do you wish to join the troupe I'll establish in the future?\"\nHearing Baek Cheon’s nonsense about the troupe nearly sent her into a panic attack. \"A theater troupe?!\"\nThe mere thought of performing in front of people drained the blood from her face. She looked ready to collapse.\n\"No? Then what exactly do you want me to teach?\"\nBaek Cheon's question prompted Jeong Hyeon to take several steadying breaths.\nFor someone who struggled to speak even to Baek Cheon, approaching him for instruction took tremendous courage.\nThe main reason for this is Il-mok. More precisely, it was because of what happened on the day Il-mok went missing.\n‘If only I hadn't been such a coward...’\nShe remembered the moment Il-mok had tried to speak with her; she'd panicked and run away.\nAt that time, she was simply embarrassed. The mere thought of conversing with Il-mok had been unbearable.\n'I'm content just staying here with Disciple Jeong.'\nIl-mok's words wouldn't leave her mind.\nShe wasn't deluding herself, though. Someone as exceptional as that young master couldn't possibly harbor special feelings for her. It’s just that the combination of what had happened in her mental realm and her overly active imagination made it difficult for her not to run her mind wild.\nAbsurd fantasies kept surfacing, making it impossible for her to maintain composure around Il-mok. So she'd avoided him. ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ novel·fire·net\nShe'd told herself that even though she was avoiding him now, someday her heart would settle and she'd find the courage to face him again.\nThen came that terrible evening. When she heard the news that the young master had gone missing, she fell into panic.\n‘If I'd been with the Young Master...’\nLike during the first and second tests, if she'd stayed by his side, this disaster might never have happened.\nSuch regret was eating away at Jeong Hyeon.\nThen, by chance, she'd witnessed Baek Cheon's declaration upon returning to the Hall.\n\"Hmph. Fools. I’ll savor your expression when you see his return.”\nJeong Hyeon, who had been trapped in regret, couldn't help but be shocked.\n‘That senior actually believes the Young Master will return...’\nWhy had she automatically assumed he was dead?\nThe thought haunted her as she began observing Baek Cheon in secret.\n'If I could be confident like that senior...'\nShe envied his complete indifference to others' opinions, that bold confidence that nothing could shake.\nFinally, she'd summoned every scrap of courage she possessed.\n'Right, I can't keep running forever. Even if the Young Master returns, nothing changes if I remain like this.’\nDetermined to transform herself, she'd approached Baek Cheon for teachings.\n\"I... I find it incredibly difficult to speak in front of people... It's... it's just too hard...\"\nJeong Hyeon, who finished speaking while trembling, hung her head low. Even this simple confession left her gasping for breath.\nBaek Cheon, who had been watching her for a moment, asked. \"So you want to learn how to talk to people?\"\nJeong Hyeon silently nodded.\n\"Because like now, when you try to speak, you tremble and your breathing becomes rapid?\"\nShe nodded again.\nJeong Hyeon found it hard to speak, so she just nodded vigorously in response to the questions.\nBaek Cheon, who had been staring at Jeong Hyeon as if evaluating her, suddenly burst into hearty laughter.\n\"UHAHAHAHA! You've come to the right person! You must have recognized my natural gift for drawing people’s attention.\"\nHis fan snapped open as he slipped into his theatrical persona.\n\"However, I possess innate talent, that's why I bask in people’s love and admiration. No amount of effort could make you like me. It's simply impossible.\"\nAs Baek Cheon basked in his own perceived magnificence, Jeong Hyeon quietly averted her gaze.\nIt wasn't embarrassment that made her look away.\n‘I probably shouldn't mention that I only approached him because he's always alone...’\nThe biggest reason Jeong Hyeon had asked Baek Cheon for help.\nBecause he never had anyone around him.",

    "content": "Chapter 101: Misunderstanding (1)\nHere was a man who believed the world hadn't cast him out; rather, he had cast out the world.\nBaek Cheon threw his arms wide with theatrical flair.\n\"However, mark my words! I shall transform you into a member of my new theater troupe, an actor who will stand second only to me!\"\nJeong Hyeon's head whipped back and forth in frantic denial. She had absolutely no intention of becoming an actor or a member of any theater troupe.\n\"But first, we must do something about that timid voice of yours! Come! Follow my lead!\"\nUnfortunately for her, Baek Cheon was already deep within his own fantasy world.\nAnd so began their strange routine. Every day after classes ended, Jeong Hyeon found herself dragged along by Baek Cheon's relentless enthusiasm. In truth, though she had mustered the courage to ask for his teaching, his overwhelming presence made her deeply uncomfortable.\nThe real problem, however, was his complete inability to read the room.\n\"Where do you think you're going? Stay right here!\"\nNo matter how desperately she tried to escape, he clung to her like a persistent leech. Worse still, he had no qualms about bellowing at the top of his lungs, regardless of who might be watching.\n(TL Note: Poor girl.)\n\"Now then! Take a deep breath, put strength in your stomach, and shout! AHAHAHAHAHA! Come on, give it a try!\"\nWhen every pair of eyes in the vicinity turned toward them, Jeong Hyeon's mind went completely blank. In a moment of pure desperation, she grabbed Baek Cheon's hand and ran off.\nShe led him to the secluded clearing where she used to spend quiet moments with Il-mok, a place where she thought no one would come.\nThe moment they arrived, she realized what she'd done and quickly let go of Baek Cheon’s hand.\n\"Eek!\"\nShe screamed as panic assaulted her, but for some reason, she had a strange feeling.\n‘I held someone's hand. Actually held it. Me!’\nPerhaps spending time with this eccentric senior might help her overcome her affliction, even if only slightly.\nWhile Jeong Hyeon was wrestling with her own mind, Baek Cheon surveyed their surroundings.\n\"Hmm. You want to practice here?\"\nShe nodded eagerly.\n\"Hmm, but surely I should display my magnificent talents for all to see.\"\nThis time she shook her head with equal vigor.\nBaek Cheon watched her animated responses—nodding frantically one moment, shaking her head the next—before his face lit up with sudden understanding.\n\"So that’s how it is! Even the most skilled performer never reveals an unfinished work! Practice should be done in secret, and only perfection should grace the stage. The audience can only be truly amazed when they witness the completed masterpiece!\"\nHe gazed at her with newfound respect.\n\"I see now that you possess the talent of an actor!\"\nWhile Jeong Hyeon silently questioned his sanity, her inability to voice objections left her with nothing but helpless head-shaking.\n\"Ha! No need for such modesty in my presence!\"\nWhile Jeong Hyeon felt an ominous feeling that she had gotten involved with the wrong person...\nThud.\nBaek Cheon suddenly approached Jeong Hyeon and shouted.\n\"Excellent! Let us begin in earnest! Take a deep breath, just like when you do your breathing exercise, and put strength in your stomach. Then, laugh! AHAHAHAHAHA! Now you try!\"\n\"A-aha... ahahaha...\"\n\"No, no, no! That won't do at all! Again!\"\nUnable to resist Baek Cheon’s relentless insistence, her face burned crimson with embarrassment as she forced herself to make sounds she'd never imagined producing.\nFor several days after that, the two continued practicing in that secluded clearing.\nAnd now, several days later.\n\"Ahem.\"\nIl-mok, who had been watching this bizarre scene, finally couldn't hold back and cleared his throat.\nBoth Baek Cheon and Jeong Hyeon spun around, their eyes widening to the size of dinner plates.\n\"Young Master Il-mok!!!\"\n\"Y-Y-Young Master...?\"\nTheir reactions couldn't have been more different.\n\"I knew you'd return safely! This Baek never doubted you for a moment! AHAHAHAHAHA!\"\n\".......\"\nBaek Cheon approached with a laugh as if he might embrace him at any moment, while Jeong Hyeon twisted her body nervously, not knowing what to do.\n\"Young Master, you must regale me with tales of your adventures! I’m sure inspiration will spring forth endlessly to me after hearing your stories!’\nIl-mok ignored Baek Cheon's nonsense and focused on the figure cowering in the background.\n\"Disciple Jeong, has Senior Baek been... bullying you?\"\nFrom where Il-mok stood, this looked disturbingly like a case of systematic harassment.\n\"Bullying? Preposterous! I've been providing invaluable instruction to help this young friend!\"\nRegardless of the accused's protests, Il-mok kept his attention fixed on the supposed victim.\nMeeting his gaze, Jeong Hyeon felt heat flood her cheeks as memories of their previous encounter came rushing back. Though embarrassment made speech very difficult for her, she managed to steady herself with several deep breaths.\n\"It's... It's true, Young Master.\"\n\"This crazy bastard... I mean, what exactly has Senior Baek been teaching you?\"\n\"I'm l-learning how to t-talk with p-people.\"\nFinally, the pieces clicked into place for Il-mok.\n'I heard there are methods such as shock therapy.'\nHe recalled hearing that people who were afraid of singing or acting in front of others sometimes overcame it by doing street performances.\n\"...You've had it rough.\"\n\"I'm f-fine.\"\nThe two exchanged glances filled with complex emotions. Then Baek Cheon spoke to Il-mok again.\n\"Hahaha! I'm glad the misunderstanding has been cleared up! Now then, Young Master, tell me about your adventure at Oblivion Ridge.”\nIl-mok suppressed a sigh. \"I'll tell you the story another time. For now, could you give us some privacy? I need to speak with Disciple Jeong alone.\"\nIl-mok thought this was his chance to find out why Jeong Hyeon had been avoiding him.\nBut for some reason, as soon as Il-mok finished speaking, Jeong Hyeon violently shook his head from side to side.\nHaving Baek Cheon present felt manageable, but the thought of being alone with Il-mok again made her mind go wild again.\nIl-mok's expression darkened as he witnessed Jeong Hyeon’s violent rejection.\n‘Damn it. He's still avoiding me. But why?\nCompletely missing Jeong Hyeon's distress, Baek Cheon laughed heartily and prepared to make his exit.\n\"Hahaha! Since we've made a promise, you must tell me next time!\"\nWatching Baek Cheon move toward the clearing's edge, Jeong Hyeon went pale and felt panic seize her throat.\n\"D-don't go!... please....\"\nThough her voice faded to barely a whisper by the end, that initial cry had been unmistakably loud.\nBoth men stared in astonishment at this rare vocal display.\n\"You see!! If you try, you can do it. This is surely the fruit of my excellent tutelage! HAHAHAHA!\"\nBaek Cheon suddenly became pleased and approached Jeong Hyeon, patting her shoulder enthusiastically.\nIl-mok watched their oddly harmonious interaction with growing bewilderment, then let out a defeated sigh.\n\"I appear to be the problem here.\"\nIf someone like Jeong Hyeon, who suffered from severe social anxiety, was willing to shout just to prevent being alone with him, his presence must be truly unbearable to her. The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the novel-fire.ɴet\n'Tsk. Did I really do something so hateful to him?'\nWhile puzzled by various things, Il-mok was about to leave when another whisper stopped his steps.\n\"Please... don't go...\"\nIl-mok stopped walking and looked at Jeong Hyeon with a puzzled expression.\n\"Are you talking to me?\"\nHidden behind Baek Cheon Jeong Hyeon frantically nodded her barely visible head up and down.\n'What kind of situation is this? He can’t stand being near me, but he also can't bear having me leave?\nIl-mok was still processing this situation when a booming voice shattered the afternoon calm.\n\"Junior Il-mok!\"\nA familiar voice rang out, and soon Mak Ho-yeol burst into the clearing.\n“You can't imagine how happy I was when I heard the news of your safe return!”\nThe sight of yet another enthusiastic lunatic drew a weary sigh from Il-mok's lips.\n'Why do the crazy bastards keep multiplying?'\nWhether he knew Il-mok's feelings or not, Mak Ho-yeol stated his true purpose.\n\"Now that you've returned safely, give me an answer to my sincerity!\"\n\"What sincerity are you talking about?\"\n\"The letter I gave you before I left!\"\nA question mark appeared in Il-mok's head.\n‘Letter? What letter?’\nThen a hazy memory surfaced.\nIt was a memory of tossing something aside without a second thought the moment Mak Ho-yeol pressed it into his hands.\n\"Sorry, but I didn't even read it.\"\nRather than taking offense at Il-mok’s brutal honesty, Mak Ho-yeol threw back his head and laughed heartily while drawing his saber.\n\"Hahaha! Don't worry! The challenge letter was just a formality anyway, now, face my saber!”\nWithout waiting for Il-mok’s answer, Mak Ho-yeol launched himself forward and opened the battle with lethal moves, even manifesting his saber qi.\nIl-mok's sword was drawn from its sheath on pure instinct.\nFor the first time since his intensive training with Elder Kang, he would put these new techniques to the test against a human opponent.\nClang!\nThe moment Mak Ho-yeol's saber met Il-mok's sword wrapped in Sword Qi, something extraordinary happened. Mak-ho-yeol's saber strangely twisted its path and bounced to the side.\nSoul-Stealing Heartless Sword, Second Secret Technique: Soul-Repelling Sword.\nIt was a technique that utilized the Sword Qi wrapped around the blade at the moment of collision to deflect the colliding object.\nThe Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's final eight techniques transcended mere swordplay, focusing instead on the masterful manipulation of Sword Qi itself. Il-mok had already glimpsed this principle during his duel with Baek Cheon, when he'd woven together multiple techniques masterfully.\nIn retrospect, he'd been unconsciously grasping these advanced concepts all along.\nMak Ho-yeol stared in shock as his full-power strike was casually deflected.\n'This can't be....'\nHe'd dedicated himself to grueling training after their last encounter. He had even received a month of special training from Vice Hall Master Yu Geuk.\n'The gap... hasn't narrowed.'\nNo, far from narrowing, the gap had widened considerably.\nDuring their first duel, they'd at least managed a proper exchange of moves. But now, his saber was deflected in just one exchange, and the Young Master's sword was already flying toward his throat.\n‘Is this how it ends?’\nOf course, since this was merely a sparring match between fellow disciples, Il-mok would stop short of delivering a killing blow. But even if he didn't die, the emptiness of losing in just one exchange didn't disappear.\nWhile Mak Ho-yeol wore a dejected expression from having sensed his defeat...\nIl-mok's sword path, which had been flying toward his throat, twisted.\nInstead of stopping at his throat, the blade angled toward his face.\nThwack!\nThe flat of the sword connected with Mak Ho-yeol's cheek in a stinging slap.\n\"What the—\"\nHaving been slapped by a sword, Mak Ho-yeol shouted in bewilderment.\n\"Haa!\"\nBefore he could finish his bewildered protest, Il-mok was already moving again.\n'Fuck it. Since I've drawn my sword, let's finish this properly.'\nIl-mok had grown tired and sick of dodging duel-obsessed lunatics like Dokgo Pae and Mak Ho-yeol. Today, he planned to give him a proper mental education so he'd never think of challenging him again, just like he had done with the idiotic trio.\nHis expression turned demonic as his sword began its relentless dance.\nThwack! Thwack!\nThe flat of his sword repeatedly struck Mak Ho-yeol's face and body.\nAt first, Mak Ho-yeol seemed confused by this unconventional approach to combat. But then...\n'So that's how it is!'\nUnderstanding dawned, and his face transformed with gratitude.\n\"Hahahaha! My deepest thanks, Junior Il-mok!\"\nDespite the vast gulf in their abilities, his junior was extending their fight to provide valuable teachings through practical demonstration.\nFilled with appreciation, Mak Ho-yeol continued swinging his blade even as Il-mok's \"lessons\" rained down upon him.\nClang!\nThwack!\nIl-mok deflected each wild swing before delivering another educational correction to Mak Ho-yeol's form.\n\"Uhahahaha! Give me more!!\"\nIl-mok, who had intended to vent his frustration, unconsciously got goosebumps.\n'Looking at this bastard, not only is he a battle maniac, he is a masochist too!”",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 102",
    "content": "Chapter 102: Misunderstanding (2)\nHow long had Il-mok been pummeling Mak Ho-yeol while wondering when this ridiculous situation would finally end?\n\"Huff... huff...\"\nSweat beaded on Il-mok's forehead as he caught his breath.\n\"Gasp... gasp...\"\nMak Ho-yeol, who had been thoroughly beaten, was sprawled on the ground, chest heaving after his thorough beating.\nPushed to his absolute limit against Il-mok's sword—which clearly showed the gap in their skills—Mak Ho-yeol's face was flushed red as he spoke with a genuine delight.\n\"Gasp... Please spar with me again, Junior Il-mok.\"\nEvery hair on Il-mok's body stood on end.\nThe man was practically glowing with satisfaction even after receiving such a beating.\nThey say you can't spit on a smiling face. But the truly terrifying one isn’t the kind that keeps smiling when you spit on them; it’s the one who thanked you for spitting on them. Those people are the genuinely dangerous ones.\n‘Fuck. If only I could kill him.’\nAfter pondering for a moment, Il-mok let out an irritated sigh and shouted.\n\"Don't ever come looking for me again!\"\nHe spun on his heel and walked away.\nWhen you encounter a problem that can’t be resolved, avoiding that problem is the best strategy to counter it.\nBesides...\n'Damn obsessive-compulsive disorder.'\nRight now, his immediate priority is to clean his sword, which had been contaminated from dealing with that pervert, and then scrub himself clean.\nAs Il-mok was about to leave the clearing, Baek Cheon hurriedly followed him.\n\"Young Master Il-mok! What on earth happened at the Oblivion Ridge? Your skills have truly improved by leaps and bounds!\"\nDesperate for inspiration, Baek Cheon was eager to hear what happened to Il-mok in the Oblivion Ridge.\nOnce Il-mok and Baek Cheon disappeared...\n\".......\"\n\".......\"\nOnly Mak Ho-yeol, who collapsed on the ground, and Jeong Hyeon, who didn't know what to do, remained in the clearing, creating an awkward atmosphere.\n\"You there.\"\n\"Y-yes!?\"\nJeong Hyeon nearly jumped out of her skin at the sudden call, but Mak Ho-yeol merely laughed heartily.\n\"Mind giving me a hand? I'm afraid my body isn't cooperating. Haha.\"\nWhile the beating had been exhilarating, Mak Ho-yeol had no strength to move now that the fight was over.\n\"H-help you... up?\"\nThe color drained from Jeong Hyeon's face.\nThe thought of physical contact with a complete stranger made her throat constrict.\n\"F-forgive me!\"\nOverwhelmed by the mere suggestion, Jeong Hyeon quickly bowed and frantically fled the clearing.\n\".......\"\nStill flat on his back, Mak Ho-yeol could only stare forlornly at Jeong Hyeon's retreating figure.\nIgnoring the leech-like Baek-cheon, Il-mok returned to the Black Dragon Pavilion and immediately tended to his weapon.\n‘It’s fucking dirty.’\nHe meticulously cleaned and sharpened his sword, which had been dirtied from beating up the pervert, then cleansed his body in the bath.\nAnd when Il-mok returned to his after what felt like an eternity, what welcomed Il-mok was his cherished companion.\n\"Finally. After seven days and nights without you.\"\nThe thing that faithfully accompanied him ever since his first day in this damned cult was his diary.\nIl-mok began writing in his diary to drive away his obsessive-compulsive symptoms.\n—Your handwriting's gotten sloppy after so long.\n—Did you forget how to write already?\n—That happened on the fourth day, not the third day.\nMore precisely, he was allowing his alternate personality to surface through writing to prevent more severe compulsive episodes.\nWhether it was because he had to write seven days' worth of diary entries or because of the sheer volume of bizarre experiences at the Oblivion Ridge, the writing seemed endless.\nIl-mok finally set down his brush near midnight.\n\"Phew.\"\nStill, Il-mok felt somewhat refreshed after he managed to finish writing all that into the papers.\nAs soon as the ink dried, Il-mok closed the book and collapsed onto his bed.\n\"Home sweet home.”\nMaybe because he had been living here for months and the contrast of the harsh environment of the Oblivion Ridge to this place was so jarring, he felt the bed was particularly cozy at this moment.\nWith his body and mind much more at ease, Il-mok fell fast asleep.\nThe following morning brought his first dawn at the Hall of the Demonic Way after being trapped in that place for a week and also brought him several unexpected developments.\n“Hm? How come Disciple Jeong is in our class?”\nDuring the free time between Chu Il-hwan’s morning class, with the instructors and assistants absent, the disciples of the Upper Class gathered to chat with each other.\nAnd for some reason, among them was Jeong Hyeon, who belongs to the Lower Class.\nHearing Il-mok’s question, Jeong Hyeong who was busy maintaining their distance, took several deep breaths as if calming his mind and was about to answer Il-mok’s question.\n\"Disciple Jeong has been promoted to the Upper Class this time.\"\nBang Mi-hwa interjected and showed her haughty face. As usual, she covered her left side with her fan while talking with a voice dripping with superiority.\n\"Ah.\"\nOnly then did Il-mok recall a certain memory. Something he vaguely remembered from Jin Hayeon during his preparations for entering the Hall of the Demonic Way.\n'Come to think of it, she said that class assignments change periodically based on performance.’\nSince Jeong Hyeon had been his teammate for both the first and second tests, his score must have been amazing since their team had placed first on both tests.\nSo long as he didn't mess up the last test, which Il-mok himself failed, getting into the Upper Class should have been guaranteed.\nHaving thought that far, Il-mok frowned.\n“Should I go to the Lower Class then? Instructor Chu said that my last test score was a failure.”\n“Ohohoho. No need to worry, Young Master. Your exceptional scores on the first and second tests are more than enough to compensate for your failure in the third. You won’t have to drop to the Lower Class.”\nFair enough. Two first-place finishes and one dead-last performance still averaged above the median.\nWhile Il-mok nodded with a reasonably convinced expression...\n\"But unfortunately, Young Master Il-mok is no longer the top student. I'm sorry to say this to you since you got caught up in an incident, but I became the top student after the last test. Ohohohoho.\"\nHer preening made everything crystal clear.\n‘She came here to gloat.’\nBang Mi-hwa had always been haughty, but today she was practically radiating smugness.\nBut Il-mok in particular felt no emotion toward her gloating. Il-mok himself had no interest in whether he came first or last as long as the Heavenly Demon or Jin Hayeon weren’t involved.\nBesides...\n'Well, there's still more than a year and a half left until graduation, so it'll work out somehow.'\nHonestly, he didn't think he'd lose any future tests.\nThanks to the torturous training under Elder Kang when he was on the Oblivion Ridge, his cultivation realm had increased even when he didn’t want to.\nHaving lost interest in her, Il-mok casually looked around to see if anyone else besides Jeong Hyeon had changed.\n'The trio is still the same.'\nChoi Woong and his lackeys—who always maintained polite facades during training—were still present, as was Bang Mi-hwa's long-time friend Ha Young.\nEven Dokgo Pae still retained his seat in the Upper Class.\n“How come that boar is still in the Upper Class? He had always chosen stupid methods during every test.”\nBang Mi-hwa burst into her characteristic haughty laughter and answered. “That's because this is the Hall of the Demonic Way. While his approaches were indeed foolish, Disciple Dokgo's martial prowess kept him from falling.”\nHe could understand what she meant.\n'His other scores are rock bottom, but his martial prowess is high enough to keep him in the Upper Class.”\nFor some reason, that assessment reminded him of his Eldest Brother, Wi Jin-hak.\n‘Didn’t they say that Eldest Brother never loses the top seat when he was at the Hall?’\nAmong the Heavenly Demon's disciples, his Eldest Brother was said to be one of the most gifted when it came to martial arts.\nWhile he had an inferiority complex about being stupid— which Jin Hayeon claimed was largely unfounded—his overwhelming combat abilities had apparently allowed him to retain the top seat through graduation.\n‘Hmm... So, Eldest Brother was essentially a superior version of that boar-like guy?’\nThe image of his Eldest Brother somehow overlaps with that of Dokgo Pae.\nA thought suddenly occurred to him. Il-mok has a hunch that his Eldest Brother’s personality during his day as a student in the Hall of the Demonic Way must be similar to Dokgo Pae's.\nWhile observing Dokgo Pae, Il-mok inadvertently made eye contact when the boar-like guy turned his head.\nHe braced himself for another round of a duel challenge, but Dokgo Pae rushed over to say something bizarre.\n\"Young Master Il-mok! I heard the story from Big Brother Mak!\"\n\"!?\"\nStory? What story?\nAn ominous chill ran down Il-mok's spine as Dokgo Pae continued breathlessly.\n“You gave him guidance during your sparring match!”\nIl-mok's expression soured instantly.\n'Guidance? What fucking guidance? I clearly beat him half to death?!?’\nAs expected, a pervert's way of thinking couldn’t be processed with logic.\nThat afternoon.\nAfter finishing all his lessons, Il-mok enjoyed his usual bath and meal before wandering around the Hall of the Demonic Way using his stealth technique.\n'The clearing is dangerous.'\nHe wanted to hide there but that place was now recognized as his hideout. Mak Ho-yeol's appearance there yesterday proved as much.\nHe'd been skulking around the Hall, evading numerous lunatics, when fragments of conversation reached his ears.\n\"I simply cannot understand how someone with such mediocre abilities managed to rise to the Upper Class.”\n\"Isn't it all thanks to the Young Master?\"\nSince he was suddenly mentioned, Il-mok stopped walking.\nWhile gossiping behind someone's back was something that could happen since even kings got cursed behind their backs, one should at least make an effort not to get caught.\n\"Choose your words carefully. While it's true he made it to the Upper Class thanks to the Young Master, that hardly makes it the Young Master's fault.\"\n\"That's true.\" Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs novel_fіre.net\nAs Il-mok listened, he realized he wasn't the target of the gossip.\n'This reminds me of what happened with Ju Seo-yeon early after enrollment.'\nEarly in his enrollment, Ju Seo-yeon's persistent attention had spawned similar rumors.\nBack then, when Ju Seo-yeon kept clinging to him, causing strange rumors to circulate among the students.\nHe initially suspected more gossip about her, but the mention of the Upper Class ruled that out.\nAnd Il-mok could easily deduce who the target of the gossip was.\nThe target of their slander was none other than Jeong Hyeon.\nUnable to understand why they were badmouthing Jeong Hyeon, Il-mok crept closer.\n\"If he at least had outstanding skills, I could understand. But honestly, do you think I am truly inferior to this Jeong Hyeon?\"\nOnly after hearing the words of the male student positioned in the center could Il-mok remember who he was.\n'A guy who was originally in the Upper Class.\nHe was someone who had dropped to the Lower Class when Jeong Hyeon moved up to the Upper Class.\n'Tsk. So it was jealousy.'\nLooks like he was venting his anger through gossip after being overtaken by a student whom he had deemed beneath him.\nThe other three appeared to be from the intermediate class, but they too joined in badmouthing Jeong Hyeon, who had risen up alone.\nThis was often seen in competitive schools in modern South Korea too. It frequently appeared as material in dramas and novels as well.\nAnd this phenomenon wasn’t limited to juvenile students either. He’d occasionally see such behaviour when he was still a student preparing to take the civil servant exam. He had seen it too during his university days.\nAnd he had even seen much more than those two combined during his days as a civil servant.\nCases where people would become blinded by jealousy when a colleague, junior, or a close senior got promoted first.\nThis rotten behavior was pretty much universal, as all humans, regardless of age, possessed jealousy.\nSo, as a fellow human, Il-mok could understand their jealousy to an extent. However...\n“That’s a stupid question. I’ve been training with him for the past three months, and Disciple Jeong’s abilities were terrible.”\n\"Exactly. It's questionable how he even got into the Hall of the Demonic Way with those skills.\"\nTheir ridicule over Jeong Hyeon's abilities was something Il-mok simply couldn't accept.",

    "content": "Chapter 103: Misunderstanding (3)\n'They don't know what they are talking about.'\nMartial arts were relative. They varied depending on compatibility and circumstances, making it nearly impossible to precisely quantify someone's true skill level.\nEspecially since the martial art Jeong Hyeon had learned was archery, which was bound to change greatly depending on conditions and situations.\nEven accounting for that, Il-mok didn't think Jeong Hyeon was inferior to those guys.\nMoreover.\n'Unlike these brutes who only know how to charge straight ahead, Jeong Hyeon actually has skills that matter in real combat.'\nThese fools thought Jeong Hyeon only succeeded because of his help. In reality, all he'd done was give him the right opportunities to showcase his existing talents.\n'Tsk. Morons. They treat Jeong Hyeon's versatility as nothing more than petty tricks.'\nWhether it was because of their ignorant fanaticism or because they were still young, there was a persistent prejudice against archery and hidden weapons in the cult.\nThe petty gossip of young and pathetic fools. Il-mok felt there was no need to bother dealing with them.\nThe real concern would be if this escalated beyond mere gossip into actual bullying.\nWhile Il-mok pondered his next move, something interesting caught his attention.\n\"We were planning to confront him about it, but he's been clever, staying close to 'that person' ever since the Young Master disappeared.\"\n\"I saw them myself just yesterday. Practically joined at the hip.\"\n\"Exactly. Getting involved with 'that person' is... well, it's problematic for obvious reasons.\"\nWho was this 'that person' they couldn't bring themselves to name?\nThe answer came quickly.\n'Right... sticking close to that deranged attention-seeker would definitely make things complicated.'\nThey were talking about Baek Cheon.\nJeong Hyeon had only sought Baek Cheon's help to learn basic social skills, but these idiots assumed he was using him as a human shield.\n'At least that lunatic is keeping the bullies at bay.'\nEven dog shit had its uses, as Il-mok was learning.\nHe simply turned away from the gossiping quartet and walked off.\nHe concluded that he saw no reason to intervene as long as there was no actual bullying.\nAs he walked away from the pathetic quartet, Il-mok found himself thinking about Jeong Hyeon and Baek Cheon.\n'Come to think of it, those two really are an odd pair.'\nBoth were outcasts, but for entirely different reasons.\nOne avoided people due to crippling social anxiety. The other craved attention from anyone willing to give it.\nThe problem was that Baek Cheon didn't discriminate between types of attention, which led people to treat him like a complete lunatic and keep their distance.\n'...Ahem. Well, he was probably always like that.'\nIl-mok felt a twinge of guilt. His advice had transformed Baek Cheon into a lunatic who didn't care about others' gazes at all.\nAnother thing they had in common was that both had learned archery and hidden weapon techniques, which were looked down upon by the Demonic Cult's warriors.\nWhile this made Jeong Hyeon even more self-conscious, it only seemed to fuel Baek Cheon's craziness. That lunatic apparently believed nothing drew attention quite like flashy hidden weapon techniques.\n'Strange how they both complement and clash with each other.'\nThe moment that thought crossed his mind, Il-mok shuddered violently and shook his head.\n\"Great. Now I'm going insane from dealing with these lunatics too much. Here I am thinking about two men being suited for each other.\"\nRubbing away the goosebumps on his arms, Il-mok quickly activated his stealth technique to avoid the perverted trio.\nMeanwhile, back at the gossip session.\n\"First clinging to the Young Master, and now to that person. As a fellow woman, her behavior is absolutely shameless.\"\nBut Il-mok had already moved too far away to hear this revelation.\nThe next morning brought Instructor Chu Il-hwan's regular martial arts class.\nIl-mok maintained his usual routine.\nDuring Instructor Chu Il-hwan's usual martial arts class, Il-mok, as always, used the idiot trio to create a human barrier around himself while half-heartedly swinging his sword.\nBut he wasn't dozing off today. Unlike the usual, he kept stealing glances somewhere through gaps in his living shield.\nAfter several careful observations, Il-mok reached a conclusion.\n'This is actually concerning.' The source of thɪs content is noveⅼfire.net\nHe finally understood why those quartets had been trash-talking Jeong Hyeon.\nOf course, he had no intention of justifying their gossip.\nIt's just that.\n'Is he really this bad?'\nJeong Hyeon's archery was genuinely awful.\nOne side of the training ground had been set up with various targets specifically for his archery practice, courtesy of the instructor and his assistant.\nEvery arrow Jeong Hyeon released crawled through the air at pathetic speeds with equally pathetic accuracy. He rarely came close to hitting the center of any target.\nThis was baffling.\nThe archery Jeong Hyeon had shown when they were alone in the clearing or when they were partnered during the exam was nothing like this disaster.\nIt didn’t take long for Il-mok to understand why his archery level had dropped this disastrously.\n‘...It’s because people are watching.’\nThere is a phenomenon known as stage confidence in this world.\nThere are some people who could display their abilities to the fullest even when countless people’s gazes focused on them. And there are even people who could show better skills than usual when more eyes were watching.\nThen there is also the opposite.\nCases where one couldn't even display half their abilities once they got on stage.\nHe'd heard of countless talented singers, actors, and athletes whose careers died because they couldn't perform when it mattered. All the skills in the world meant nothing if you couldn't display them when people were watching.\nJeong Hyeon clearly fell into the latter category.\n'He must have been like this throughout his time in the Lower Class.'\nNo wonder his classmates thought he was hopeless. Three months of watching this level of performance would convince anyone that he lacked talent.\nUntil now, Il-mok had only seen his archery during the practical test and their time at the clearing. So he couldn't have imagined Jeong Hyeon would be in such a state.\nWhile Il-mok diagnosed the problem, Jeong Hyeon was struggling with her own thoughts.\n'Why, why, why does he keep looking at me?'\nIl-mok's persistent gaze was destroying what little focus she had left.\nShe was already nervous enough with her classmates watching during every training session. Now Il-mok's scrutiny made everything exponentially worse.\nTwang!\nHer hand trembled and caused her to release the bowstring prematurely. More embarrassingly, the awkward sound of the bowstring snapping echoed through the training ground.\nThud.\nThe arrow bounced off the string and landed with a pathetic plop at her feet.\n\"Pfft...\"\nSomeone's snickering pierced Jeong Hyeon's ears.\nChoi Woong was curious about what had captured Il-mok's attention, and he followed his gaze just in time to witness the spectacular failure.\nHe couldn’t contain his laughter.\nJeong Hyeon's face went white as paper as she heard that laugh. Her hands shook so violently that she could barely bend down to retrieve the fallen arrow.\n\"Tsk.\"\nIl-mok clicked his tongue lightly and struck the back of Choi Woong's skull with his sword sheath.\n\"Focus on your own training instead of gawking during class.\"\n\"Ugh...\"\nChoi Woong bit back his response and tried his best to keep his mouth shut even as tears welled up in his eyes.\nHe wasn't holding back from pain.\n'Damn it!'\nHe was terrified that if he didn’t hold himself back, curses would spill from his mouth and that would guarantee another round of beating.\nThat afternoon, Il-mok returned to the secluded clearing.\nHe'd worried that the morning's humiliation might have driven Jeong Hyeon into hiding, but fortunately, he was there.\n\"Hahahaha!\"\n\"Ahaha... hahaha.\"\nHe was, once again, going through that bizarre routine with Baek Cheon under the guise of practising abdominal breathing.\n'...It seems less like he came out voluntarily and more like he was dragged here by that attention-seeker.'\nIl-mok had such suspicions, but since it wasn't an immediately important issue, he decided to let it pass.\n\"Ahem.\"\nWhen Il-mok cleared his throat to announce his presence, the two who had been laughing together turned their gazes toward him.\n\"Young Master Il-mok! Perfect timing!\"\n\"Y-Young Master?\"\nIl-mok ignored Baek Cheon who was enthusiastically welcoming him and addressed Jeong Hyeon directly.\n\"Jeong Hyeon, let me ask you one thing.\"\n\"P-please ask.\"\nFacing the trembling Jeong Hyeon, Il-mok calmly opened his mouth.\n\"What do you think you're best at?\"\n\"Pardon...?\"\nUnable to grasp the intent of the question, Jeong Hyeon reflexively asked back. But when Il-mok just stared at her intently without saying anything else, she quickly lowered her head to avoid his gaze and fell into thought.\n'What am I best at?'\nHonestly, nothing came to mind immediately. Since nothing came to mind on her own, she fell back on what others had told her.\nSpecifically, what her only friend had praised her for.\n\"A-archery and stealth techniques. T-Then tracking, I'm good at th-those.\"\nIl-mok felt a wave of relief at her response before asking his follow-up question.\n\"Then, what about talking with people? Is that something you're confident in?\"\n\"N-no...\"\nJeong Hyeon answered with her shoulders completely drooped, looking utterly dejected.\nBut Il-mok’s next words made her raise her head again with a surprised expression.\n\"You're training with Baek Cheon because social interaction is difficult, right? Instead of practicing something you struggle with, why not start with something you're good at?\"\n\"I-I don't understand what you m-mean?\"\n\"It's simple. Getting frightened when performing before others is normal, so why bother making it more difficult for yourself?”\n“Th-Then, are you saying I should sp-spar?”\nIl-mok shook his head.\n\"Sparring could work, but let's start with archery. Just practice your archery while Baek Cheon and I watch.\"\n\"...?\"\n\"We'll observe your training, so ignore our presence and focus on your practice.\"\nIl-mok's reasoning was straightforward. If she could not even bring herself to perform archery in front of a dozen or so observers, how about starting with just two?\nHonestly, Il-mok preferred not to meddle in other people's problems. But this situation required minimal effort on his part.\n'All I have to do is watch.'\nHe had no intention of training seriously after his torment at the Peach Blossom Ridge anyway. Watching Jeong Hyeon practice archery was hardly a burden.\nHe could treat it like watching a performance.\nBetter yet, he wouldn't need to provide instruction or analysis.\n\"Also, Baek Cheon, you'll teach her while we watch.\"\nBecause there was Baek Cheon to teach Jeong Hyeon in his place.\n'Even dog shit can serve a purpose.'\nAnd Baek Cheon was proving to be a surprisingly useful dog shit.",

    "content": "Chapter 104: Misunderstanding (4)\nBlissfully unaware that Il-mok considered him a useful dog shit, Baek Cheon's face practically glowed with delight.\n\"A teacher, you say?\"\nThe word \"teacher\" had clearly struck a chord in him.\n‘He really is an attention seeker.’\nGive him a role and some recognition, and he becomes absolutely ecstatic.\n\"That's right. While you didn’t learn archery techniques, you’ve learned hidden weapon techniques that also require fighting from a distance. Also, your skills are exceptional, Senior Baek. You’ll be a great help in this case.”\n\"Hahaha! Young Master Il-mok truly has an eye for people! Leave everything to me!\"\nWith Baek Cheon eagerly accepting his role as teacher, Il-mok turned back to observe Jeong Hyeon.\n\"We can begin now.\"\nUnder the intense scrutiny of both Il-mok and Baek Cheon, Jeong Hyeon moved like a reanimated corpse. Her limbs jerked awkwardly, her right arm and leg moving in a bizarre synchronization.\nYet despite her clumsy display, Il-mok and Baek Cheon simply watched with expressionless faces.\nWhen Jeong Hyeon finally began nocking arrows with trembling hands, Il-mok discreetly leaned toward Baek Cheon and whispered.\n\"When instructing Disciple Jeong as a teacher, there's one thing you absolutely must pay attention to.\"\n\"What's that?\"\n“You must, and I mean must , start with praise and end with praise.”\nIn Il-mok's view, one of the biggest reasons people find it difficult to perform in front of others is their lack of confidence.\n\"Even when you spot glaring flaws, never say 'that's wrong' or 'poorly done.' Start with encouragement first, then suggest improvements in a way that doesn’t lower Jeong Hyeon’s self-esteem. Frame it as 'if you do this, you'll get even better.' Understood?\"\n“I can see the logic in this, but why use this approach?”\n\"People gain more strength when they receive praise. Didn’t you experience this yourself, Senior Baek?\"\n\"Ah!\"\nUnderstanding dawned across Baek Cheon's features. Thɪs chapter is updated by novel-fire.net\nBeing a man thirsty for praise and attention, he knew how good it felt when the people in his surroundings validated his efforts.\nWhile they whispered their strategy, Jeong Hyeon continued her awkward archery display. She stumbled through the entire set of the Ghostly Spirit Divine Archery forms and had just let out a ragged sigh when a sudden storm of applause erupted.\nClap clap clap!\n“That was magnificent!”\n\"Ha! I knew you had it in you, Disciple Jeong!\"\nThe praise didn't stop there. Il-mok and Baek Cheon lavished her with enthusiastic encouragement.\n‘Wh-what exactly did I do well?’\nJeong Hyeon wanted to disappear into the earth itself.\nThe pattern continued. Every time she finished performing her botched forms, a round of applause and encouragement would pour from Il-mok and Baek Cheon. The applause and encouragement never ceased as she collected the arrow she had shot from the target.\nClap clap clap!\n“Hahaha, look how carefully he picks up his arrows! Wonderful!”\nClap clap clap!\n“Exactly! Look at that disciplined form! Such sharp, precise movements!”\nThe constant praise from behind made her hands shake violently as she gathered her arrows.\nOne thing became crystal clear to Jeong Hyeon: this was psychological torture disguised as training.\nThe following afternoon, instead of directly heading to the clearing to help Jeong Hyeon again, Il-mok first headed towards the training ground.\nHe decided to recruit one more audience member to watch Jeong Hyeon’s training, to get him accustomed to the people’s attention.\nBringing one more person when he was still rattled by just two might have been risky, but Il-mok had a reason.\n‘Right. When it comes to grinding, setting things on autopilot is always best.’\nHe planned to bring in one more person, introduce them to the cheering squad, then make a graceful exit when the situation stabilized.\nAnd the chosen candidate for the cheering squad is none other than Ju Seo-yeon.\n\"Young Master Il-mok!\"\nShe, who had been devoted to training alone in the training hall, welcomed him warmly. But her warm greeting wasn’t particularly welcome to him.\nShe greeted him warmly from her solitary training session, though her enthusiasm felt somewhat overwhelming.\nIl-mok had actually spoken with her shortly after he returned to the Hall of the Demonic Way.\n\"When I heard the news that you had gone missing, I almost passed out, Young Master!”\nShe had greeted him enthusiastically.\n\"Were you that worried?\"\n\"Of course I did! If something bad happened to you, I would’ve had to find another way to get close to Miss Jin Hayeon.”\n\"...\"\nHer follow-up had left him so moved that he was at a loss for words. He couldn’t decide if he should admire her honesty or despise her for her utter lack of tact.\nIn any case, they had exchanged greetings a few times since then. He just didn't want to get close to an unnervingly honest lunatic and honestly wanted nothing to do with her.\nBut Baek Cheon had taught Il-mok a valuable lesson.\n\"I need you to come somewhere with me.\"\nIl-mok had realized that even dog shit has its uses.\nHe turned his heel to the clearing with Dog Shit Number Two following behind him and gave her a briefing on the situation.\n“You were in the same class previously, so you should know each other. Your task is simple; from now on, your job is to watch Disciple Jeong Hyeon practise archery with us.”\n\"???\"\nJu Seo-yeon's confusion was evident on her face.\n“Young Master, didn’t you say you’d only take me as your attendant if I ranked second in the Hall? I don’t have time for this. I need to train.”\nIl-mok had a feeling she’d say that. The fact that he could now predict the behavior of a madwoman was depressing, but it was predictable nonetheless.\n“Don’t worry. You won’t just be watching. You’ll be alternating between observing and sparring.”\n\"!? Y-Young Master?\"\nJeong Hyeon shot him an alarmed look, but he pressed on.\n“Observe Disciple Jeong’s Ghostly Spirit Divine Archery and think of ways to counter it, then apply your own insight during your sparring. Afterwards, watch his archery again and reflect on how you might better face it. Don't you think that would be a great way to improve?”\nJu Seo-yeon's face lit up with a moved expression. “As expected of the Young Master! You were planning to accept me as your attendant all along! I won’t disappoint you, I will take the second rank, Young Master!”\nWhile her interpretation was wildly inaccurate, Il-mok saw no benefit in correction.\nSoon, the three of them—Il-mok, Baek Cheon, and Ju Seo-yeon—sat cross-legged as Jeong Hyeon’s demonstration began.\nBelieving that she carried his expectation, Ju Seo-yeon's eyes sparkled with the same unsettling intensity as Baek Cheon's.\n‘Do all unhinged people share that particular gleam?’\nAt this rate, he felt like he’d develop the ability to spot crazy bastards just by looking at their eyes.\nBut that wasn't what was important right now.\n‘Time to set up the auto grind system.’\nOnce the system was in place, he wouldn’t have to deal with these psychos for a while.\n“Listen carefully, Disciple Ju. You need to praise Disciple Jeong constantly.”\n“Haaaah…”\nWith a deep sigh, Jeong Hyeon wondered, ‘Why? Why has my life become this nightmare?’\nAs if to prove her point, the moment she fired an arrow, a thunderous wave of applause and cheers erupted from behind her.\n“Hahaha! Magnificent skill!”\n“You were aiming for the edge of the target on purpose that time! You almost fooled me there.\"\n\"So that's what it was! Disciple Jeong is amazing!\"\nThe relentless praise from Baek Cheon, Il-mok, and Ju Seo-yeon made her face burn so hot she thought it would explode. Her body trembled, and she couldn’t focus at all. Her arrow had flown wildly off course, but now they were praising it as if it were intentional.\n‘I-I I'm going to die. Actually, I want to die.’\nShe felt she was on the verge of either dying from Qi deviation or simply shooting an arrow straight up to her Baihui Acupoint to end it all.\n(TL Note: The crown of her head.)\nEither way, the cause of death would be the same: death from shame.\nNoticing her constant trembling, Il-mok briefly hesitated.\n‘Hmm? Is the praise not working?’\nWhile he contemplated stopping, Jeong Hyeon, standing at a crossroads between life and death thought.\nWhy on earth would Young Master Il-mok go to the trouble of bringing other people here just to praise her?\n‘Could this be his payback for avoiding him back then?’\nBut even if she grasped Il-mok's intention, nothing changed.\nUnderstanding his intent changed nothing about her predicament. The humiliation remained unbearable. If this kept up, she was truly going to die one way or another.\n‘Please, just make the praise stop…’\nShe could endure their stares, but the constant verbal praise was driving her toward madness.\nIt was strange. Not long ago, just making eye contact with Il-mok was enough to send her reeling, but now she couldn’t care less about his gaze. As long as she could block out the noise, the stares didn’t matter.\nBut that was impossible.\nThe core function of the Ghostly Spirit Divine Archery she had learned was tthe maximization of senses.\nIt sharpened an archer’s awareness, allowing them to react to threats with superhuman speed and execute the precise shots needed to hit distant targets. By its very nature, it meant dulling one’s senses was out of the question.\n‘…But what if it’s not about dulling them, but redirecting them?’\nIn that moment of crisis, an idea she had never before considered sparked in her mind.\nShe, who had been trembling and nocking arrows with a reddened face, suddenly closed her eyes and concentrated her mind.\nShe focused inward and guided her internal energy according to the mysteries of Ghostly Spirit Divine Archery.\nWithin her heightened senses, everything in a ten-foot radius was perceptible as if her eyes were wide open.\n‘This is my domain.’\nAfter confirming the extent of her sensory field, she began to twist the flow of her internal energy, going against the very current she had cultivated for years. Because she was going against the path she had repeated for years, pain came as if her meridians were being twisted and blood surged up to her throat, filling her mouth with the taste of blood.\nStanding at the crossroads between Qi deviation and enlightenment, Jeong Hyeon made a choice that was uncharacteristically bold for her.\nShe continued to twist the flow of internal energy.\nAfter all, if things continued as they were, the only future left was death from humiliation.\nHer internal energy fought back against her will, but then…\nWhiiiiiing.\nShe was certain. Her choice was right.\nThe spherical domain that had enveloped her began to change. Subtly at first, the shape started to warp, narrowing in some places and expanding in others.\n\"Huu…\"\nBreathing deeply, she refined her domain like a sculptor creating a work of art.\n‘I won’t hear the sounds from behind me.’\nShe radically reshaped her territory. She pulled her senses from all sides and concentrated them into a single, forward-facing point, shaping it like a needle.\nExternally, she was as still as a statue, standing motionless with her bow drawn and eyes closed. However, Il-mok, who was watching her, noticed the change.\nIt wasn’t just the cold sweat pouring down her brow; it was the violent tempest of qi swirling around her. Standing there motionless, she looked like she was in the eye of a typhoon.\nIl-mok had seen a sight like this before.\nThis is just like what happened with Jin Hayeon!\nHe'd witnessed this exact scene when Jin Hayeon achieved her breakthrough with the White Hand Demonic Art. The thought spurred him into action. He quickly made a hushing gesture to Baek Cheon and Ju Seo-yeon.\n“Looks like she’s having an enlightenment. Silence.”\nWhen Il-mok muttered in a whisper, Ju Seo-yeon and Baek-cheon nodded with uncharacteristically serious faces.\nWith the troublemakers properly warned, Il-mok observed Jeong Hyeon's transformation with a satisfied expression.\n‘Just as I thought. They say praise can even make a whale dance.’\nHe was certain his little experiment had been a resounding success.",

    "content": "Chapter 105: Misunderstanding (5)\nShe wasn’t sure how long she’d been lost in that state of selfless focus.\n\"Huu.\"\nWith a deep sigh, the turbulent torrent of Qi swirling around Jeong Hyeon subsided.\nPop.\nAs she opened her eyes, her pupils held a calm light like that of a still lake.\nHer eyes opened, revealing pupils that held the serene clarity of an undisturbed lake.\nYet beneath that tranquil gaze, she experienced something entirely foreign—a sensation so alien it felt as though she'd been transported to another realm entirely.\nThe wind at her back seemed muted and the world around her seemed distant. In contrast, everything in front of her seemed to rush toward her with overwhelming intensity.\nPebbles twenty feet away looked like they were right under her nose. The target, several dozen feet further, seemed within arm's reach. Beyond the target, far in the distance, she felt she could even sense what was happening inside the pavilion. The subtle vibrations carried by the wind tell her stories of the events unfolding within.\nIn that strange state of perception, Jeong Hyeon released the bowstring she had been holding along with the arrow.\nTwang!\nThe taut string snapped forward, launching the arrow.\nTwang!\nBefore the first had even struck home, a second arrow was already nocked and loosed.\nThe five arrows she fired in quick succession clustered in the center of the target as if they had been one from the start.\nThe instant the first arrow hit the bullseye…\nCrack-crack-crack!\nThe second punched through the shaft of the first, splitting it as it claimed the exact same spot. The third followed suit, and the rest repeated the scene. What made it truly miraculous was that each arrow had followed a different trajectory.\nIt was the result of imbuing the later shots with more power and, beyond that, sensing the flow of the wind in every moment to make minute adjustments to the arrows' angles.\n\"...\"\nThe display was nothing short of miraculous that Il-mok stood stunned and silent as he witnessed the scene.\nBut that lasted only briefly.\n\"Huu.\"\nThe instant Jeong Hyeon lowered her bow with a deep sigh, Il-mok shot to his feet.\n“Congratulations, Disciple Jeong!”\nUnlike before, his praise was genuine as he approached her.\nOf course, Il-mok, who was familiar with Jeong Hyeon's condition, didn't cross the line. He stopped at exactly ten feet away. Meanwhile, the immense mental strain began to take its toll, and Jeong Hyeon’s sensory field slowly reverted to its original shape.\nSince this was a newly acquired enlightenment, controlling it freely right away was impossible.\nThe moment her perception, which had been stretched forward like a needle, snapped back into its usual sphere—\n\"!?\"\nJeong Hyeon twitched as if struck by lightning, then went rigid as stone.\n\"What's wrong?\"\nIl-mok asked with a puzzled expression, but Jeong Hyeon, who had been looking forward, turned her body slowly with wooden puppet-like movements and simply stared at Il-mok with a pale face.\nThe reason Jeong Hyeon suffered from social anxiety was that her senses had become extremely sensitive due to the effects of the Ghostly Spirit Divine Bow.\nTherefore, whenever someone approached within ten feet—where her senses were most acute—she would have a panic attack.\nKnowing this, Il-mok had stopped at a safe distance. But there was one crucial detail they had both completely forgotten.\nJeong Hyeon’s mastery of her Demonic Art had grown with her recent enlightenment.\nOnly after her sensory field returned to normal did Jeong Hyeon realize it: her nest, the area she perceived so keenly, had gotten bigger.\n“B-ba… back…” she stammered, her face white as a sheet, looking as though she couldn't breathe. A moment later, her eyes rolled white, and she collapsed.\n\"Disciple Jeong!\"\nStartled, Il-mok practically flew forward, catching her just before she hit the ground.\nLooking down at Jeong Hyeon, who had fainted in his arms, a wry thought crossed his mind.\n‘Is this the second time now?’\nFor some reason, it reminded him of their first meeting.\n‘He’s pretty light for a guy.’\nHis stature was small for a man. Because he was always hunched over, his shoulders were narrow too. His hair was cut short, which was rare in this world, and his body was quite lanky. But if he were a woman, his stature would make him quite tall.\n'Probably just malnourished.'\nIl-mok began to think that he might just be underfed and hadn't yet reached his full height.\nIl-mok carried the unconscious Jeong Hyeon to Instructor Eun Ryeo. Their first encounter had come to mind. Now that Jeong Hyeon was in the Upper Class, finding Chu Il-hwan might have been more appropriate, but for various reasons, he felt Instructor Eun Ryeo was the better choice.\nWhen Il-mok appeared carrying Jeong Hyeon, Instructor Eun Ryeo let out a light sigh for some reason.\n“Haaah. Alright. Let’s hear what you did to Disciple Jeong this time.”\nIl-mok felt wronged by those suspicious eyes.\nInstructor Eun Ryeo took Jeong Hyeon from him as if snatching him away, laid him on a bed, and then led him out of the room. He then recounted the day’s events like an accused defending his name before a judge.\nAfter hearing Il-mok's full explanation, Instructor Eun Ryeo nodded and spoke.\n\"Though I'm not certain, it was likely due to the enlightenment. As Disciple Jeong's mastery deepened, the side effects probably became more severe.”\nIl-mok nodded, finding her explanation plausible. “Ah, that seems to be the most likely reason.”\nInstructor Eun Ryeo looked at Il-mok with a complicated expression for a moment before speaking. “I will talk to Disciple Jeong to be sure. You should head back for now. And just in case, try to keep a little more distance from now on.”\n“I will be careful.”\nAfter Il-mok departed, Instructor Eun Ryeo returned to the recovery room. She closed the door and kept her distance from the bed, knowing that Jeong Hyeon might panic upon waking.\nWith the room occupied by Jeong Hyeon and herself, she dropped her characteristic cold mask and looked at Jeong Hyeon with a face full of worry.\n‘Hah. I really don't know if getting involved with the Young Master is a good thing for this child.’\nFrom Il-mok's account, Jeong Hyeon's enlightenment this time was largely thanks to him. As a martial artist, a companion who could lead you to such breakthroughs was an invaluable treasure.\nYet...\n'She's too fragile to withstand the young lord and his lecherous ways.’\nAs a woman herself, Instructor Eun Ryeo couldn't help but worry about Jeong Hyeon’s future.\nThe following morning brought training as usual.\nFortunately, Jeong Hyeon participated in training in good health.\n“I heard what happened from Instructor Eun Ryeo,” Chu Il-hwan said. “Just in case, you should stand a little further back during practice.”\n“Th-thank you, I-Instructor.”\nAt his instruction, Jeong Hyeon, who was already isolated, moved even further away from the group.\nThough the exchange was brief, Il-mok was able to piece things together.\n‘So the side effects did get worse because of the enlightenment.’\nWhen training began, Il-mok half-heartedly swung his sword as usual while sneaking glances at Jeong Hyeon’s practice. He soon noticed something new.\n'Hmm? He seems fine today?'\nJust as she had in the clearing the day before, Jeong Hyeon was demonstrating archery skills that bordered on divine, despite a dozen or so of her peers training nearby.\nBut that didn't last long. After firing a few shots, Jeong Hyeon lowered his arms with a deep sigh.\n\"Eek!\"\nHe made a startled face and began darting anxious glances around him.\nIl-mok couldn’t understand why he would suddenly act that way when he had been shooting fine, but for Jeong Hyeon, it was unavoidable.\nShe had achieved enlightenment, sure. But she was still too inexperienced to control it freely.\nIl-mok couldn't fathom the sudden change, but Jeong Hyeon's limitations were clear enough to her. The enlightenment remained beyond her full control, draining her mental reserves each time she manipulated her awareness.\nTwisting her sensory field required a massive amount of mental energy.\nAs a result, she could only manage it for short bursts when she was in peak condition. Once her mental energy ran low, she would snap back to normal and be overwhelmed by anxiety.\n‘Hmm. I guess he hasn’t completely gotten used to people’s eyes yet.’\nSatisfied with his assessment, Il-mok looked away and went back to swinging his sword half-heartedly.\nThat afternoon, Il-mok headed to the clearing with Ju Seo-yeon.\n\"Yesterday was all archery,\" Il-mok suggested. \"How about some actual sparring today?\"\nSince this training was designed for Jeong Hyeon, who still had difficulty dealing with people, the two ended up starting the spar about twenty feet apart from each other.\nThe Hall of the Demonic Way clearly prohibited all manner of unofficial sparring and matches, but unfortunately, all four people present couldn’t care less about that.\n'Th-this isn't right... I-Instructor Eun Ryeo clearly said we shouldn't do this....'\nActually, Jeong Hyeon was worried about it, but she couldn't bring herself to say anything.\nAs for Baek Cheon and Ju Seo-yeon, they weren't the types to care about rules.\n‘Won’t it be fine as long as we don’t get caught?’\nAnd Il-mok was the type of person who only cared about rules when they were useful to him.\nIn the end, unable to resist the pressure from the three, the sparring began.\n“Hmm.”\nWatching the fight, Il-mok let out a small hum.\n‘I guess focusing on martial arts for three months has paid off. She has improved.’\nJu Seo-yeon’s movements were definitely faster and more concise than when they had first been grouped together.\nHowever, Jeong Hyeon was the one controlling the spar.\nJu Seo-yeon's spear work was fluid and flashy, deflecting the incoming arrows with practiced ease, that is until—\n\"Hiik!\"\nA strangled cry escaped her lips as she threw herself into a desperate Lazy Donkey Roll.\nWhile she'd been focused on the direct shots, a cunningly arced arrow had appeared from nowhere, aimed squarely at her head.\n‘Just as I thought. He couldn't show his true skill during the last competition because there were too many people.’\nNo matter how much Jeong Hyeon had improved, the gap between his skill now and what he’d seen at the tournament was just too vast. At the time, he’d assumed he’d lost so easily because, as an archer, starting a fight in an open space at a mere twenty-foot distance was a disadvantage. But now, he could safely conclude that the audience watching from the sidelines had been the bigger problem for Jeong Hyeon.\nWhile Il-mok was lost in thought, the spar continued.\nJu Seo-yeon deployed spear techniques focused on the principles of illusion and transformation. She flashily wielded her single spear to deflect the arrows and desperately moved her legs to close the distance.\nClang!\nBut for every move she made, Jeong Hyeon would quickly fire an arrow and move to widen the gap even more.\nEventually, Ju Seo-yeon failed to close the distance, and a situation unfolded where she could only deflect arrows endlessly.\nThunk!\nWith a blunted arrow landing cleanly on Ju Seo-yeon’s ribs, the sparring came to an end.\n\"Hahaha. That was truly an excellent match.\"\nBaek Cheon, ever the attention seeker, fulfilled his role as a teacher and poured out praise while speaking exaggeratedly.\n“Disciple Jeong’s intuition is truly excellent. If you could just practice seeing the bigger picture, it would be perfect. For example, instead of always retreating backward like this, you should consider moving in a circular pattern like this…”\nBaik Cheon provided his best explanation and even demonstrated his advice by utilizing his lightness skills and throwing hidden weapons.\nAnd surprisingly, Ju Seo-yeon listened intently to his advice, even nodding her head eagerly at the display.\nIt seemed she was trying to figure out a counter-strategy by listening to Baek Cheon’s advice to Jeong Hyeon.\nWatching the three of them chatting enthusiastically and continuing their training and sparring, Il-mok nodded satisfactorily.\n'Perfect. Now I can truly relax.'\nWith the group functioning independently, he was free to do as he pleased.\nHe spent a good while grinning to himself, pondering how best to slack off alone, when a sound broke his reverie—\n\"Huu.\"\n\"It would be good to stop here for today. Hahaha.\"\nJeong Hyeon’s deep sigh and Baek Cheon’s hearty laugh reached Il-mok’s ears.\n“Well, I suppose we should be heading back.”\nIl-mok stretched his stiff muscles from prolonged sitting around doing nothing. Ju Seo-yeon, covered in sweat and dust from rolling on the ground, beamed.\n\"That's a good idea, Young Master!\"\nThen she turned to the person who made her roll on the ground and beamed.\n“Since we’ve bonded over this spar, why don’t we wash up together? It’s been a while, Disciple Jeong.”\nIl-mok's expression turned strange at her words. ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ Nov3lFɪre.ɴet\n“What do you mean by bathe together, Disciple Ju?”\n“??? I meant we should take a bath together, Young Master. We’ve run into each other at the bathhouse before.”\n\"Doesn't the Black Dragon Pavilion have separate baths for men and women?\"\nThree sets of eyes fixed on him with expressions of profound confusion, as if he'd asked why water was wet.\nUnder their collective gaze, Il-mok's thoughts began to churn. He replayed the events of the past few months in his head and finally realized he had gotten something terribly wrong.\nWith a bizarre expression on his face, he turned to Jeong Hyeon with caution in his voice.\n“Disciple Jeong… by any chance… are you a woman?”\nChapter 105: Misunderstanding (5)\nShe wasn’t sure how long she’d been lost in that state of selfless focus.\n\"Huu.\"\nWith a deep sigh, the turbulent torrent of Qi swirling around Jeong Hyeon subsided.\nPop.\nAs she opened her eyes, her pupils held a calm light like that of a still lake.\nHer eyes opened, revealing pupils that held the serene clarity of an undisturbed lake.\nYet beneath that tranquil gaze, she experienced something entirely foreign—a sensation so alien it felt as though she'd been transported to another realm entirely.\nThe wind at her back seemed muted and the world around her seemed distant. In contrast, everything in front of her seemed to rush toward her with overwhelming intensity.\nPebbles twenty feet away looked like they were right under her nose. The target, several dozen feet further, seemed within arm's reach. Beyond the target, far in the distance, she felt she could even sense what was happening inside the pavilion. The subtle vibrations carried by the wind tell her stories of the events unfolding within.\nIn that strange state of perception, Jeong Hyeon released the bowstring she had been holding along with the arrow.\nTwang!\nThe taut string snapped forward, launching the arrow.\nTwang!\nBefore the first had even struck home, a second arrow was already nocked and loosed.\nThe five arrows she fired in quick succession clustered in the center of the target as if they had been one from the start.\nThe instant the first arrow hit the bullseye…\nCrack-crack-crack!\nThe second punched through the shaft of the first, splitting it as it claimed the exact same spot. The third followed suit, and the rest repeated the scene. What made it truly miraculous was that each arrow had followed a different trajectory.\nIt was the result of imbuing the later shots with more power and, beyond that, sensing the flow of the wind in every moment to make minute adjustments to the arrows' angles.\n\"...\"\nThe display was nothing short of miraculous that Il-mok stood stunned and silent as he witnessed the scene.\nBut that lasted only briefly.\n\"Huu.\"\nThe instant Jeong Hyeon lowered her bow with a deep sigh, Il-mok shot to his feet.\n“Congratulations, Disciple Jeong!”\nUnlike before, his praise was genuine as he approached her.\nOf course, Il-mok, who was familiar with Jeong Hyeon's condition, didn't cross the line. He stopped at exactly ten feet away. Meanwhile, the immense mental strain began to take its toll, and Jeong Hyeon’s sensory field slowly reverted to its original shape.\nSince this was a newly acquired enlightenment, controlling it freely right away was impossible.\nThe moment her perception, which had been stretched forward like a needle, snapped back into its usual sphere—\n\"!?\"\nJeong Hyeon twitched as if struck by lightning, then went rigid as stone.\n\"What's wrong?\"\nIl-mok asked with a puzzled expression, but Jeong Hyeon, who had been looking forward, turned her body slowly with wooden puppet-like movements and simply stared at Il-mok with a pale face.\nThe reason Jeong Hyeon suffered from social anxiety was that her senses had become extremely sensitive due to the effects of the Ghostly Spirit Divine Bow.\nTherefore, whenever someone approached within ten feet—where her senses were most acute—she would have a panic attack.\nKnowing this, Il-mok had stopped at a safe distance. But there was one crucial detail they had both completely forgotten.\nJeong Hyeon’s mastery of her Demonic Art had grown with her recent enlightenment.\nOnly after her sensory field returned to normal did Jeong Hyeon realize it: her nest, the area she perceived so keenly, had gotten bigger.\n“B-ba… back…” she stammered, her face white as a sheet, looking as though she couldn't breathe. A moment later, her eyes rolled white, and she collapsed.\n\"Disciple Jeong!\"\nStartled, Il-mok practically flew forward, catching her just before she hit the ground.\nLooking down at Jeong Hyeon, who had fainted in his arms, a wry thought crossed his mind.\n‘Is this the second time now?’\nFor some reason, it reminded him of their first meeting.\n‘He’s pretty light for a guy.’\nHis stature was small for a man. Because he was always hunched over, his shoulders were narrow too. His hair was cut short, which was rare in this world, and his body was quite lanky. But if he were a woman, his stature would make him quite tall.\n'Probably just malnourished.'\nIl-mok began to think that he might just be underfed and hadn't yet reached his full height.\nIl-mok carried the unconscious Jeong Hyeon to Instructor Eun Ryeo. Their first encounter had come to mind. Now that Jeong Hyeon was in the Upper Class, finding Chu Il-hwan might have been more appropriate, but for various reasons, he felt Instructor Eun Ryeo was the better choice.\nWhen Il-mok appeared carrying Jeong Hyeon, Instructor Eun Ryeo let out a light sigh for some reason.\n“Haaah. Alright. Let’s hear what you did to Disciple Jeong this time.”\nIl-mok felt wronged by those suspicious eyes.\nInstructor Eun Ryeo took Jeong Hyeon from him as if snatching him away, laid him on a bed, and then led him out of the room. He then recounted the day’s events like an accused defending his name before a judge.\nAfter hearing Il-mok's full explanation, Instructor Eun Ryeo nodded and spoke.\n\"Though I'm not certain, it was likely due to the enlightenment. As Disciple Jeong's mastery deepened, the side effects probably became more severe.”\nIl-mok nodded, finding her explanation plausible. “Ah, that seems to be the most likely reason.”\nInstructor Eun Ryeo looked at Il-mok with a complicated expression for a moment before speaking. “I will talk to Disciple Jeong to be sure. You should head back for now. And just in case, try to keep a little more distance from now on.”\n“I will be careful.”\nAfter Il-mok departed, Instructor Eun Ryeo returned to the recovery room. She closed the door and kept her distance from the bed, knowing that Jeong Hyeon might panic upon waking.\nWith the room occupied by Jeong Hyeon and herself, she dropped her characteristic cold mask and looked at Jeong Hyeon with a face full of worry.\n‘Hah. I really don't know if getting involved with the Young Master is a good thing for this child.’\nFrom Il-mok's account, Jeong Hyeon's enlightenment this time was largely thanks to him. As a martial artist, a companion who could lead you to such breakthroughs was an invaluable treasure.\nYet...\n'She's too fragile to withstand the young lord and his lecherous ways.’\nAs a woman herself, Instructor Eun Ryeo couldn't help but worry about Jeong Hyeon’s future.\nThe following morning brought training as usual.\nFortunately, Jeong Hyeon participated in training in good health.\n“I heard what happened from Instructor Eun Ryeo,” Chu Il-hwan said. “Just in case, you should stand a little further back during practice.”\n“Th-thank you, I-Instructor.”\nAt his instruction, Jeong Hyeon, who was already isolated, moved even further away from the group.\nThough the exchange was brief, Il-mok was able to piece things together.\n‘So the side effects did get worse because of the enlightenment.’\nWhen training began, Il-mok half-heartedly swung his sword as usual while sneaking glances at Jeong Hyeon’s practice. He soon noticed something new.\n'Hmm? He seems fine today?'\nJust as she had in the clearing the day before, Jeong Hyeon was demonstrating archery skills that bordered on divine, despite a dozen or so of her peers training nearby.\nBut that didn't last long. After firing a few shots, Jeong Hyeon lowered his arms with a deep sigh.\n\"Eek!\"\nHe made a startled face and began darting anxious glances around him.\nIl-mok couldn’t understand why he would suddenly act that way when he had been shooting fine, but for Jeong Hyeon, it was unavoidable.\nShe had achieved enlightenment, sure.

    "content": "Chapter 106: A Match Made in Heaven (天生緣分) (1)\n\".......\"\n\".......\"\nAn awkward silence descended upon the clearing.\nEveryone present wore expressions of utter bewilderment as they stared at Il-mok, who found himself increasingly embarrassed under their collective gaze. He let out an awkward cough.\n\"Ahem. Well... why did you keep your hair so short?\"\nThis was one of the two main reasons he had mistaken her for a man. In this era, long hair was common among men. Moreover, it was almost unheard of for women to cut their hair short.\nIl-mok’s question snapped Jeong Hyeon from her daze.\nShe never would have imagined that Il-mok had been mistaking her for a man all this time.\n\"I-it was because it would get in the way when shooting arrows...\"\nWhile answering Il-mok's question, Jeong Hyeon was thinking of something else.\n'So that's what he meant by those words.’\nShe recalled what had happened that day.\n—I'm content just staying here with Disciple Jeong.\nThe words Il-mok had said to her. Now she understood their meaning.\n'...He just meant it was comfortable being with me. Since he thought I was a man.'\nRemembering how she had fled in a panic, her heart pounding like a wave crashing against the shore, she couldn't stop her head from drooping.\nSeeing Jeong Hyeon suddenly hang her head low, Il-mok felt cold sweat running down his back.\n'Shit...'\nIt wasn't because he thought he might have hurt her feelings by mistaking a woman for a man.\n'Don’t look. Get a grip, Il-mok.\nThe second reason he’d mistaken her for a man kept popping into his head, and he felt his gaze being drawn toward a certain area. It was one thing when he didn’t realize her true identity, but knowingly staring at her now that he knew she was a woman would be sexual harassment.\nWith Jeong Hyeon hanging her head low and Il-mok averting his eyes to avoid looking at her, silence once again descended upon the clearing.\nAnd the one who broke that silence was none other than Ju Seo-yeon.\n“Ah! So that’s why you thought she was a man!”\n\"???\"\nBoth Il-mok and Jeong Hyeon looked at her with puzzled expressions at her sudden remarks.\n“I only found out when we bathed together, but Disciple Jeong wraps her chest in bandages so it doesn't get in the way of her archery.”\n\"!!!\"\n'Wraps what?\nAs Il-mok tried to figure out the omitted subject from Ju Seo-yeon's explanation, she continued.\n\"It was truly an amazing sight. To think something so magnificent could be hidden just by wrapping it in bandages. Hahaha.”\nJu Seo-yeon gave Jeong Hyeon a thumbs up, as if telling her she was truly spectacular.\n\"Hiik....\"\nJu Seo-yeon’s sudden remarks turned Jeong Hyeon’s face bright red and made her curl into herself.\n'She's not an Amazon warrior or anything...'\nWhile Il-mok was having such trivial thoughts, he looked at the embarrassed Jeong Hyeon and the pleased expression on Ju Seo-yeon's face, and belatedly remembered something important.\n\"Disciple Jeong.\"\nAt Il-mok's sudden call, Jeong Hyeon, who had been on the verge of losing her mind from embarrassment, slowly lifted her head to look at him.\n\"...?\"\nFor some reason, Il-mok was staring at her with an expression more serious than any she had ever seen.\n\"Listen carefully.\"\nWhen Jeong Hyeon nodded with a half-dazed face, Il-mok warned her.\n“Never, and I mean never, go to the bathhouse together with Disciple Ju.\"\nIl-mok's out-of-the-blue command left not only Jeong Hyeon, but also Baek Cheon and Ju Seo-yeon staring at him completely dumbfounded.\n'...Just because people of the same gender use the bathroom together doesn't make it safe.'\nWhat Il-mok had belatedly remembered was Ju Seo-yeon’s… preferences.\nAround the same time Il-mok was planning to complete his little plan, the Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi was having a conversation with Instructor Chu Il-hwan in his residence.\nThis time, it wasn't Yeom Ga-hwi who had summoned the instructor, but Chu Il-hwan who had come to see him. He was here to report on the events of the previous day.\n\"Hmm. So a student named Jeong Hyeon gained enlightenment thanks to Disciple Il-mok...\" Yeom Ga-hwi muttered, stroking his beard with a fist covered in his signature calluses.\n'The Supreme One will be very pleased.'\nAs Yeom Ga-hwi stroked his beard, his mind drifted back to a few days ago, right after Il-mok had returned alive from the Oblivion—no, the Peach Blossom Ridge.\nYeom Ga-hwi had received a summons from the Heavenly Demon and went to the main headquarters to meet with him privately.\n'It had been a long time since I'd seen the Supreme One so happy.'\nThe way the Heavenly Demon recounted Disciple Il-mok’s deeds on the ridge was like watching a marketplace grandfather bragging about his genius grandchild. The rıghtful source is noⅴelfire.net\nThough the Heavenly Demon was generous toward the cult members, Yeom Ga-hwi had never imagined he would become such a doting grandfather.\nThen again, considering everything he had seen and heard, he figured anyone would become a doting fool with a disciple like that.\nYeom Ga-hwi’s memory of the Heavenly Demon’s boasting naturally led to what came after.\nThe reason the Heavenly Demon had summoned him wasn't simply to brag about his disciple.\nThe main point was actually what came after.\nIt was just that, like any grandfather, he had gotten carried away bragging about his grandchild and went on too long.\n'There are unsavory groups within the Divine Cult.'\nThe Heavenly Demon suspected that Disciple Il-mok’s disappearance had been a premeditated trap. Obviously, pulling off such a trap requires a rat among the Hall’s assistants or instructors.\nHonestly, when Yeom Ga-hwi first heard this, he had mixed feelings.\nAs the Hall Master, he wasn’t angry that his subordinates were under suspicion. Rather, he was angry that the target of those unsavory people was the Heavenly Demon’s disciple.\nWithin the Divine Cult, the Heavenly Demon was the sole absolute being that existed within the cult. His disciples, while deserving of respect, were not objects of worship or reverence.\n‘This must be a preparatory move for the succession war after the Heavenly Demon’s ascension.’\nThough the Heavenly Demon called them 'unsavory groups,' in Yeom Ga-hwi's opinion, their purpose was simply to rise to the position of the next cult leader.\nFrom the perspective of a succession war, it was neither foul nor something to consider unsavory. The succession war was a festival of blood where dozens, even hundreds, of masters died.\nAnd Yeom Ga-hwi had personally witnessed that festival of blood as a fledgling who had just graduated from the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nBack then, the Hall of the Demonic Way was a hell where half the students died and only half survived. But the cult during the succession war made even that hell look like child's play.\nAnd the one who had won that festival of blood was the current Heavenly Demon.\nEven after that, challengers to the cult leader position appeared from time to time.\nThe one who had defeated those challengers, finally mastered the Heavenly Demon Divine Arts, and ultimately reached the noble position of Heavenly Demon was the man before him, Hyeokryeon Il-hwi.\nFor Yeom Ga-hwi, who remembered how the old man had clawed his way to the noble position of Heavenly Demon, it couldn't help but feel like overprotection.\nAs if reading Yeom Ga-hwi's inner thoughts, the Heavenly Demon added, \"This old man knows what Hall Master Yeom is thinking. But Il-mok is not even twenty yet. If a grown martial artist dreams of becoming the Heavenly Demon and loses his life during the process, that is the will of heaven. But that child is not yet old enough to be caught in a succession war. He should at least have the chance to decide for himself after he comes of age, don't you think?”\nYeom Ga-hwi prostrated himself and showed respect at those words.\n\"I shall follow your command.\"\nAs the Hall Master responsible for teaching young disciples, it was a reason he could accept. He had been planning to follow the Heavenly Demon’s will in the first place.\nWho is he to defy the noble Heavenly Demon’s will?\nReflecting on that day's events, Yeom Ga-hwi looked at Chu Il-hwan standing before him.\n'There are people targeting Young Master Il-mok in the Hall of the Demonic Way.'\nWith thoughts of the accomplice in mind, Yeom Ga-hwi asked Chu Il-hwan, \"How are the side effects of the Black Thunder Demonic Art these days?\"\n\"...Though I haven't completely escaped them yet, I have achieved some progress. All of this is thanks to you, Hall Master.\"\nChu Il-hwan immediately clasped his hands and expressed his gratitude, his usual playful expression replaced by one of grave sincerity.\nChu Il-hwan and Yeom Ga-hwi had known each other long before their time at the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nWhen Chu Il-hwan had just graduated from the Hall of the Demonic Way and joined the Red Dragon Corps, the leader of that Red Dragon Corps had been none other than Yeom Ga-hwi, who was making a name for himself as the Fist Demon (拳魔) at the time.\nAs the commander of his brigade and a renowned master, Chu Il-hwan had admired him from the start.\nYeon Ga-hwi, however, had viewed Chu Il-hwan unfavorably.\nThis was because a few years before Chu Il-hwan entered the Hall of the Demonic Way, the Heavenly Demon had completely reformed the Hall, essentially transforming that hellish place to become more survivable.\nFor Yeom Ga-hwi, who had endured the Hall where half the students died, those who graduated after the reforms were nothing but half-baked.\nBut despite Yeom Ga-hwi's disapproving gaze, Chu Il-hwan persistently followed him. After years of fighting alongside him in the Red Dragon Brigade, Yeom Ga-hwi finally acknowledged him, realizing that graduating from the reformed Hall didn't make him any less of a warrior.\nThen, after several more years had passed, when Yeom Ga-hwi had succeeded in mastering the Asura Blood Fist to the realm of Transcendence, a command came from the Heavenly Demon.\nTo take the position of Hall Master of the Hall of the Demonic Way, and if necessary, to select a few trustworthy people as instructors.\nFollowing the Heavenly Demon's command, before leaving for the Hall of the Demonic Way, Yeom Ga-hwi had offered Chu Il-hwan the instructor position.\nBut Chu Il-hwan had refused, citing the side effects of the Black Thunder Demonic Art as the reason.\n“My Lord. If I become an instructor at the Hall, I might end up killing the students.”\nHe had refused so as not to cause trouble for Yeom Ga-hwi, but Yeom Ga-hwi wouldn't take no for an answer.\n“Think of it the other way around. If you continue to serve in a brigade while suffering from homicidal impulses, you'll end up succumbing to those impulses every time. Teaching those youngsters will force you to suppress those urges. That might open your path to Transcendence.”\n\"!!!\"\nChu Il-hwan, who had shown a surprised expression, later composed himself and answered, “But I might not be able to overcome the impulse and could cause an accident. I cannot burden you for the sake of my own advancement, my Lord.”\n“You have become arrogant. Do you think you could cause an accident while under my watch? I will take responsibility and stop you, so do not worry.”\nMoved by Yeom Ga-hwi's consideration, Chu Il-hwan eventually followed him to transfer to the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nDuring the years he spent helping Yeom Ga-hwi teach the students at the hall, there were several incidents where he succumbed to his impulse or fell into Qi Deviation and nearly killed students, but Yeom Ga-hwi successfully prevented any major incidents from happening.\n‘It is all thanks to the Hall Master that I have been able to grow this much.’\nAnd just as Yeom Ga-hwi had said, suppressing his homicidal urges while dealing with the students had yielded some results.\nThough Transcendence was still a long way off, Chu Il-hwan had overcome one wall and begun to escape from Extremity.\n\"I will never disappoint you, Hall Master.\"\nAs if making a vow to himself, Chu Il-hwan, who had been clasping his hands, spoke to Yeom Ga-hwi with sincerity.\nYeom Ga-hwi watched him for a moment before speaking. “Keep what I am about to tell you to yourself.”\nWith that, Yeom Ga-hwi informed Chu Il-hwan of what the Heavenly Demon had instructed.\nHe knew he couldn’t monitor all the instructors and assistants alone. Moreover, having been together for over twenty years since their Red Dragon Corps days, he judged that Chu Il-hwan could be trusted.\n\"I will monitor the assistant and instructors as usual in my capacity as Hall Master.\"\n“Then I will watch over Disciple Il-mok’s surroundings, Hall Master.\"\n\"Do so.\"\nYeom Ga-hwi sent him a look filled with trust.\nAfter showing respect to Yeom Ga-hwi once more and leaving the Hall Master's quarters, a coldly murderous smile appeared on Chu Il-hwan's face.\n'How dare they try to bring dishonor to the Hall Master.'\nAttempting to assassinate the Young Master while Yeom Ga-hwi was the Hall Master was no different from a challenge to Yeom Ga-hwi himself.\nChu Il-hwan, who followed Yeom Ga-hwi like a father, was determined to find and slaughter those people without fail.",

    "content": "Chapter 107: A Match Made in Heaven (2)\nOn his way to the clearing where Jeong Hyeon, Baek Cheon, and Ju Seo-yeon would be, Il-mok had a thought.\n‘Is it about time for me to make my escape?’\nIt wasn’t because he’d found out Jeong Hyeon was a woman.\nWhether Jeong Hyeon was a woman or a man didn't particularly matter to Il-mok.\nIn fact, none of the cadets in the Hall sparked any romantic interest in him. Although he was physically sixteen, his mind was that of a mid-thirties individual.\nNot that he wanted to date someone in their mid-thirties or older, but he couldn't help but feel a certain aversion to anyone who wasn't yet an adult. It felt like committing a crime.\nWhat Il-mok craved above all else was undisturbed tranquility, moments of peace where no one demanded his attention or energy.\nWhile contemplating when he could slip away, Il-mok's eyes caught sight of Jeong Hyeon and Baek Cheon.\n\"Before Young Master Il-mok arrives, how about we practice vocal exercises together? Come on! Try shouting after me! The heaven is indifferent and the earth is desolate (天地玄黃)!\"\nThere was Baek Cheon, acting as he pleased while making her practice vocal exercises.\n“Hoo… The heaven is indifferent and the earth is desolate...\"\nAnd there was Jeong Hyeon, sighing but still doing as Baek Cheon instructed.\n'Ah!'\nIt was then that Il-mok had a realization.\n‘They matched each other very well, didn’t they?’\nMayble Jeong Hyeon took a liking to Baek Cheon.\n‘He did say she was the one who approached him first.’\nA girl with social anxiety so severe she could barely utter a word to anyone had mustered the courage to approach someone first.\nThat alone left no room for doubt about Jeong Hyeon's feelings toward Baek Cheon.\nMoreover, she who had been running away from him was now sticking around with Baek Cheon like this every day.\n'Oh no...'\nThe realization drew a bitter sigh from Il-mok. It wasn't that he was upset. It was just…\n'Who would have thought her type would be attention-seekers...'\nHe simply felt sorry for her strange taste.\nHowever, Il-mok had no intention of stopping Jeong Hyeon.\n'Ideal types change as you meet people, break up, confess, and get rejected. Yeah.'\nRomance was something you learned by bumping into things and getting hurt. He knew all too well that once someone was blinded by love, no amount of advice would get through to them.\n'Ah, to be young…'\nHe watched the budding romance between the attention whore and the social recluse with the eyes of a weary old man.\n\"Young Master. What are you doing standing there instead of going?\"\nJu Seo-yeon's booming voice snapped him out of it. Baek Cheon and Jeong Hyeon’s gazes also turned toward them.\nIl-mok suppressed a sigh at her tactless behavior and spoke to Baek Cheon and Jeong Hyeon.\n\"I have something to discuss with Disciple Ju for a moment; go on with your practice.\"\n\"With me?\"\nTo successfully redirect the tactless Ju Seo-yeon, Il-mok dangled the most effective bait he could think of.\n“It’s about Lady Jin Hayeon.”\n“If it’s about her, then I’m all ears, Young Master!\"\nWatching Ju Seo-yeon's eyes sparkle as she followed him, Il-mok couldn’t help but think whether being a lunatic and being dense are inextricably connected.\nThe next afternoon.\nThe next afternoon, after classes were over and he’d had his bath, Il-mok was enjoying his dinner.\nBang Mi-hwa, sitting to his left so he could only see her good side, quietly opened her mouth.\n\"Young Master. Are you planning to head to that clearing again today?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"Then, would it be alright if we joined you today?\"\nThough not every day, Il-mok, Bang Mi-hwa, and Ha Young often had dinner together.\nMost other disciples rushed off to train immediately after their evening meal. But Il-mok made a point to bathe the moment classes ended and would only head to the dining hall after all the sweaty disciples had left. Bang Mi-hwa, who hated the very idea of eating with Il-mok while smelling of sweat, would often join him after she had cleaned up as well.\nBut that was usually where it ended. After their meal, Bang Mi-hwa and Ha Young would typically part ways with Il-mok to do their own training.\nNevertheless, the reason Bang Mi-hwa specifically wanted to follow Il-mok today was simple.\nHer progress in martial arts had recently stagnated, and she felt frustrated by the feeling of hitting a wall.\nWhether through sparring with Il-mok or simply enjoying fresh air and conversation, she needed a change.\nAnd she was confident of one thing.\nYoung Master Il-mok, who was so clearly smitten with her, would never refuse her proposal.\nAs she expected, Il-mok nodded.\n'If Bang Mi-hwa and Ha Young join as well, I can make my exit without any problem now.'\nEven if he left, there would be Baek Cheon and Ju Seo-yeon, plus Bang Mi-hwa and Ha Young. A full four-person audience would be secured.\nHe could finally switch Jeong Hyeon's social anxiety training to full autopilot. ᴛhis chapter is ᴜpdated by n͟o͟v͟e͟l͟f͟i͟r͟e͟.net\nWith their different goals in mind, the three of them headed for the quiet clearing.\nAnd Baek Cheon, who had arrived first at the clearing with Jeong Hyeon today as well, rushed over as soon as he spotted Il-mok.\n\"Young Master! We have a problem!\"\nHe completely ignored Bang Mi-hwa and Ha Young standing behind Il-mok.\nIl-mok sighed inwardly.\nHe couldn’t even begin to guess what sort of lunacy the attention-seeking psycho had cooked up this time.\nWithout waiting for his response, Baek Cheon launched his rant.\n\"I've recently had inspiration and am planning a new play, but the problem is the actress. My beauty is so profound that I could play the female lead myself, but then who would play the hero?”\n\".......\"\n\"By any chance, do you have someone in mind to play the female lead?\"\nIt was such a classic Baek Cheon problem that Il-mok was speechless.\nJust then, Bang Mi-hwa, who had been listening, snorted from behind him.\n“Hahaha, please. If you wanted to ask me, you could’ve just said so. You're much shier than you look.\"\nWhen Il-mok turned around, wondering what nonsense this was, Ha Young, Bang Mi-hwa's best friend, clapped her hands as if she had realized something.\n\"Ah! So that's what it was! Well, I guess there’s really no one better for the heroine than Mi-hwa.”\nAs soon as Ha Young finished speaking, Baek Cheon looked Bang Mi-hwa up and down as if appraising her.\n“You think you can handle the lead role?”\n\"Ohoho. Can't you tell just by looking? The word ‘heroine’ was made for me.”\n\"Ho. I like that confidence.\"\nAfter finishing his appraisal, Baek Cheon nodded and launched into a brief summary of his play and the heroine’s character. He then gave Bang Mi-hwa a few lines, and just like that, an impromptu acting class began.\n\"That's not it! More desperately!\"\n\"It's not just about being beautiful! Get into character!”\n“That was brilliant! Hahaha!”\nBaek Cheon pointed out or praised her acting like a director.\n“Ohohoho! This posture, these lines… Am I not the picture of elegance?”\n\"Hmph. This much is only natural.\"\nAnd Bang Mi-hwa, regardless of whether she was being praised or chided, was too busy being conceited to care.\nWatching the two suddenly start their acting lessons made Il-mok's head spin.\n'...Talk about a match made in heaven.'\nJeong Hyeon, meanwhile, was breathing a quiet sigh of relief.\n‘Phew. At least he won’t be trying to make me act now.’\nFor someone already struggling with Baek Cheon, this development shone like a beacon of salvation.\nIl-mok, tearing his eyes away from the head-spinning spectacle, didn’t miss Jeong Hyeon’s sigh.\n'This foolish girl...'\nThey say if you stay still, you're halfway there.\nIn that sense, even Ju Seo-yeon had at least stayed still, but he, on the other hand, had just introduced a love rival in the form of Bang Mi-hwa.\nHis eyes instinctively found Ju Seo-yeon.\nShe’d shown up at some point and was now watching the duo with a blank, happy smile.\n'Wait, am I even more clueless than Ju Seo-yeon??'\nUnable to accept this fact, Il-mok immediately took action.\n—Disciple Jeong, I’m sorry. This won’t happen again starting tomorrow.\n\"???\"\nWhile Jeong Hyeon sent him a puzzled look at the sound transmission, “Ahem, let’s save the acting for later and get back to why we’re here, shall we?”\nHe stepped between the two engrossed actors.\n“The reason we’re all here is to help Disciple Jeong Hyeon with her archery. Senior Baek Cheon, let’s try to focus on Disciple Jeong Hyeon.”\nThe second the words left his mouth, every pair of eyes in the clearing snapped to Jeong Hyeon.\nPinned by their collective gaze, she hunched her shoulders and ducked her head.\n‘D-Did I do something to offend him again?’\nShe couldn't understand at all why Il-mok was trying to bully her again.\nAfter all of their usual routine was finished, Bang Mi-hwa, for some reason, stayed the whole time and started another acting lesson again with Baek Cheon after the practice was over.\n'What's this...? Don’t tell me Bang Mi-hwa has a thing for him too?'\nThey say that bad boys are popular with women back in his previous life, but could that also be true in this world too?\nWhile Il-mok was lost in this confusion, Jeong Hyeon let out a quiet sigh and carefully began to walk away.\nShe was trying to slip out of the clearing while no one was paying attention to her.\nBut unfortunately for her, Il-mok didn't miss Jeong Hyeon's movement.\nHe quietly followed her, careful not to enter the radius that would trigger her panic.\n\"Disciple Jeong Hyeon.\"\n\"...Yes. Young Master.\"\nWhen Jeong Hyeon answered sullenly, thinking he might be trying to bully her again, Il-mok clenched his fist and spoke.\n“No matter how hard it gets, you must not run away.”\nHe thought she was running away, crushed by the sight of Baek Cheon and Bang Mi-hwa looking like a match made in heaven.\nBut this wouldn't do. Even if she failed, she needed to face it head-on so she wouldn't have any lingering regrets.\nBecause love is something you fight for!\nAs long as you didn't become a stalker like Ouyang Mun, that is.\n\"I'll help you from the side, so hang in there just a little more.\"\nAbove all, since he was the one who had brought Bang Mi-hwa into the picture, Il-mok felt he had to do something.\nHearing Il-mok's encouraging words, Jeong Hyeon nodded with a moved expression.\n'As expected. He wasn't trying to bully me.'\nJeong Hyeon realized.\nShe understood now. Il-mok had focused everyone’s attention on her to help her overcome the side effects of the Ghostly Spirit Divine Bow.\nThe next day, and the day after that, Bang Mi-hwa brought Ha Young to the clearing, even though Il-mok hadn't invited them.\nAnd every day, before Jeong Hyeon's training started and after it ended, she would grab Baek Cheon and seriously discuss and practice acting.\nFinally, on the third day, on the way to the clearing, Il-mok—who had promised to help Jeong Hyeon—decided to ask Bang Mi-hwa directly.\n“Why are you working so hard on acting with Senior Baek Cheon? Do you have a thing for him or something?”\nAt Il-mok's question, Bang Mi-hwa suddenly raised her nose high and burst into laughter.\n\"Oh ho ho ho. You're cuter than you look, Young Master. Such jealousy.\"\n\"???\"\nHe had no idea what she was talking about, nor did he want to. So he just asked again what he had originally wanted to ask.\n“So, are you interested in him or not?”\nShe snapped open her fan with a dramatic flair and gave him a haughty look. “Ohoho, don't you worry, Young Master. The reasons why I’m learning acting from Senior Baek are, first, because I enjoy it, and second, because I think it’s actually helping my martial arts.”\n\"...Acting helps with martial arts? What kind of nonsense is that?\"\nIl-mok's expression contorted with disbelief at this unprecedented claim.",

    "content": "Chapter 108: A Match Made in Heaven (3)\nIn response to Il-mok's question, Bang Mi-hwa lifted her chin and stared into the distance.\n“When I’m acting, I feel myself being pulled into the story, becoming the female lead of that play. Sometimes I become a woman who overcame an unfortunate past and stands tall, and other times I become a pure and pitiful woman with unwavering devotion to her beloved.\"\nHer eyes, fixed on the empty air, seemed to glaze over as if in a trance.\n“And with each new woman I embody, I fall more in love with myself, with all the different charms I can display.”\n\".......\"\nSeeing her flaunt her narcissism with the fervor of a cultist meeting their god, Il-mok nodded.\nIt wasn’t a nod of understanding, but one of weary resignation.\n‘I’m the one at fault here, trying to understand a lunatic.’\nFor Bang Mi-hwa, who was already intoxicated with herself, what Il-mok thought and what attitude he displayed didn’t matter.\n\"I've been thinking too simply all this time. I failed to realize that there are so many different charms and beauties in this world. No, I believed that only the charm I possessed was the only one that mattered. But through acting, I've come to realize that there are countless beauties in this world. And...\"\nBang Mi-hwa, who had been staring into the void, paused for a moment, then she lowered her head, hiding her face behind her fan as her eyes fell upon Il-mok.\n“I have come to realize that I… am capable of embodying every last one of them.”\nBy now, a brilliant light shone from her eyes.\nIl-mok knew for sure.\n‘That’s it. Those are the eyes of a true lunatic.’\nFirst Baek Cheon and Ju Seo-yeon, and now Bang Mi-hwa. Il-mok had finally reached a level where he could distinguish between true insanity and pale imitation.\nLacking the confidence to reason with a true lunatic, Il-mok ended up heading to the clearing with Bang Mi-hwa. If there was a silver lining, it was that she wasn’t interested in Baek Cheon.\n'Those weren't the eyes of someone lying.'\nAfter more than a year of dealing with mental patients, Il-mok knew one thing for sure.\nThese bastards might spout ridiculous nonsense, but they don’t lie.\nAnd so, the evening proceeded as usual.\n\"Ohohohoho!\"\n\"Ahahahahaha!\"\nA woman intoxicated with herself and a man hungry for attention burst into deranged laughter as they practiced their craft.\n\"Excellent, Disciple Jeong!\"\n“You’ve gotten even better in such a short time!”\nWhen Jeong Hyeon demonstrated archery, everyone cheered her on together.\nAs per their routine, Baek Cheon would offer his thoughts after the spar between Ju Seo-yeon and Jeong Hyeon ended. It was then Bang Mi-hwa voiced her question.\n“Excuse me, but are Disciple Jeong and Ju the only ones permitted to spar here?”\n“I feel I've made some progress in my martial arts recently, so I'd like to try expressing it through a duel.\"\nAnd hearing her words, Baek Cheon replied with a pleased expression.\n“Hahaha! Of course! Acting’s one thing, but we’re warriors of the Cult! Why would we limit it to those two? Young Master Il-mok and I will watch to prevent any accidents, so feel free to go for it.”\nWith that, Baek Cheon suddenly winked at Il-mok, like a dog seeking praise.\nThe gesture made Il-mok’s brow furrow in disgust, but he didn’t deny Baik Cheon’s words.\n“Go ahead. Since Disciple Ju and Jeong have already fought, it would be better for Disciple Bang and Disciple Ha to duel this time.\"\nAt the end of the day, it meant he didn’t have to get involved.\n‘If the five of them take turns sparring and training with each other, eventually there will be no need for me to get involved.’\nAs for Jeong Hyeon's romantic campaign, Il-mok was sure that it would sort itself out eventually if she just kept hanging around Baek Cheon.\nNow that he had confirmed that the obstacle named Bang Mi-hwa had no interest in Baek Cheon, he had no intention of getting involved further.\nThere was no reason for him to force the issue, and love wasn't something that could be forced to begin with.\n\"Huaaaaam.\"\nWhile Il-mok yawned languidly as if about to take a nap, the sparring continued.\nBang Mi-hwa and Ha Young dueled, and Baek Cheon engaged in instructional combat with Jeong Hyeon.\nHe spaced out for a long while, watching the five of them take turns sparring one after another.\nBy the time the surroundings were completely submerged in darkness, Il-mok rose to his feet and spoke. \"It's getting quite late now, so it would be good to head back.\"\nAt Il-mok's suggestion, Ju Seo-yeon, who had become covered in sweat and dust, said with bright eyes.\n\"That's a good idea, Young Master! Since it's late, it would be good for us to bathe together!\"\nFor some reason, though Ju Seo-yeon had an innocent expression, Il-mok felt that her eyes were full of impure intentions.\n\"Disciple Ju's skills are still lacking, so I'll give her a bit more guidance. You four go ahead and bathe first.\"\nTo prevent a crime from happening, Il-mok had no choice but to hold Ju Seo-yeon back.\nJu Seo-yeon, however, thought that Il-mok was preparing her for the position of his attendant and gazed at him with a moved expression.\n“I knew you believed in me, Young Master! I swear I will live up to your expectations!”\nFaced with those sparkling, radiant eyes, Il-mok subtly turned his head away.\nJust as he’d planned, the two of them remained in the clearing.\nBaek Cheon returned to the Black Tiger Hall while Bang Mi-hwa, Ha Young, and Jeong Hyeon headed to the women's bath at the Black Dragon Hall.\nAs Bang Mi-hwa shed her dirty uniform, Ha Young, who could be called Bang Mi-hwa's personal echo chamber, let out a gasp.\n“You’re amazing, Mi-hwa! How can you have such elegant curves when we ate the same things?\"\n\"Ohoho. What are you saying? Young-ah, you’re perfectly wonderful yourself.”\nAs the two women praised each other while preparing to enter the bath.\nSwish.\nThe sound of fabric hitting the floor came from beside them. A dumbfounded exclamation escaped from the lips of Ha Young, who had just been showering Bang Mi-hwa with praise.\n“Whoa…”\nBang Mi-hwa, who had been holding her head high, curiously followed Ha Young’s gaze.\n\".......\"\nAnd she froze solid.\n\"...I've never seen anything like that before. Right, Mi-hwa?\"\nHa Young was right.\nSure, Jeong Hyeon was tall for a woman, but… how was a size like that even possible?\nWait, had she been hiding that with just bandages this whole time?\nWhile the stunned Bang Mi-hwa was having such thoughts, Jeong Hyeon, startled by Ha Young’s voice, yelped and tried to cover herself.\nOnly then did Bang Mi-hwa, freed from her paralysis, subtly turn her head to look downward.\n\".......\"\nShe felt an unfamiliar, gut-wrenching sense of defeat.\n'No.'\nShe couldn't accept this. Nothing could exist that surpassed her, the most charming and beautiful being in the world.\nHaving recently leveled up her narcissistic personality disorder thanks to her recent breakthrough, she demonstrated masterful mental gymnastics.\n“Hmph. Young-ah, size isn’t everything. The true principle of the universe is harmony and balance, wouldn't you agree?”\nBut for some reason…\nDespite her supposed victory…\nGlance.\nThroughout the entire bath, Bang Mi-hwa couldn’t stop her eyes from drifting toward Jeong Hyeon.\nThe days fell into a steady rhythm.\nTime flew by like an arrow as they spent their time in classes, took turns sparring with each other, or practicing their acting in the clearing.\nAs time passed like this, the fourth test arrived.\nThe day after the exam, which, like the third, had been an individual competition.\nAs usual after the exams, Instructor Chu Il-hwan was giving one-on-one guidance sessions to the Upper Class students about their exam scores.\nTaking advantage of the instructor's absence, Bang Mi-hwa and Ha Young approached Il-mok and his three stooges as they lounged about.\n“You truly are something else, Young Master. I never imagined the gap would grow to be quite this wide.”\nIn the individual competition, the person who had claimed first place with an overwhelming score was, unsurprisingly, Il-mok.\nYet, for some reason, her praise was met with nothing but a listless expression.\nHonestly, he wasn't happy at all.\n'Damn enlightenments.'\nIt was because his realm had risen unnecessarily high.\nHis realm, already heightened by the duel with Baek Cheon and Chu Il-hwan, reached its peak during his time at the Peach Blossom Ridge, thanks to being hounded by Elder Kang.\nIl-mok’s skills were now in an entirely different realm from his peers.\nFar from competing with his peers, if he fought seriously, he could probably even give the assistant instructors a run for their money. However, there was still quite a gap between him and the instructors.\nStill, the elevated realm wasn’t without its perks.\nIn response to Bang Mi-hwa’s compliment, Il-mok just shrugged.\n“I just tried a little harder this time, thanks to failing the last one.”\n“Hmm. You didn’t look like you were trying very hard to me.”\nHa Young and the three stooges nodded their heads in agreement.\nIl-mok watched them but didn't bother to comment.\nBecause it was true.\n‘It really had been a cakewalk.’\nThe chasm between him and his peers had grown so vast that he no longer needed to go all out.\nIn fact, it had felt less like an exam and more like a stroll through the neighborhood.\nHe’d simply subdued every student he came across in one exchange, and that naturally put him in first place.\nHis obsessive-compulsive disorder had worsened due to his higher realm, but thanks to his higher realm, the exams had become this easy.\nIl-mok couldn't tell if this was a good or a bad thing.\nHowever, the biggest talk of this exam wasn’t Il-mok’s absurd level of skill.\n\"Speaking of which, did you hear about that one student?\"\n“I heard he was lucky to be alive.”\nIl-mok nodded at Bang Mi-hwa's answer.\nA disciple from the Lower Class had been grievously injured in this exam. It wasn’t by his hand; the power gap between him and his peers was so large that anyone he subdued came away unharmed.\nA fight had broken out between other disciples, and one of them, blinded by ambition, had used a lethal technique and critically wounded his opponent.\nThe disciple who caused the injury was currently being punished, and the seriously injured disciple was immediately transported to the main headquarters.\nThough the Hall of the Demonic Way had a medical wing, it wasn’t equipped for injuries that severe.\n‘…Maybe it’d be better if I faked a serious illness and got transferred out?’\nIl-mok dreaded the thought of another ‘enlightenment’ striking him during some random class or exam.\nBut he soon shook his head.\nIf he were caught faking it, he’d get his head lopped off by his Master or Jin Hayeon. And more importantly… Fınd the newest release on novel[f]ire.net\n‘You can’t wash when you’re seriously injured, can you?’\nFor Il-mok, who suffered from hygiene obsession, not being able to bathe was a horrifying thought.\nWhile the student chattered about the injured student, Instructor Chu Il-hwan conducted his interviews in a pavilion.\nHe looked at the cadet seated before him and inwardly let out a sigh.\nIt wasn't because talking with this bastard made his homicidal impulses flare out.\n‘In any other era, this one would have been a talent competing for the top seat. But thanks to the Young Master, he's become neither here nor there.'\nSurprisingly, it was a sigh filled with regret and pity.\nBut he couldn't very well sigh right in a student’s face.\nReturning to his usual playful expression, Chu Il-hwan asked, “Disciple Dokgo, do you plan to take all the remaining exams in this manner?\"\n“As the eldest grandson of the Dokgo Family, how could I possibly shy away from a head-on clash?”\nAt that brazenly confident answer, Chu Il-hwan's right hand twitched.\nHe was a talent who entered the Hall of the Demonic Way in second place and was the heir of the Dokgo Family, one of the Five Great Demonic Families, but he placed last in this exam.\nBecause as soon as the exam started, he rushed at Il-mok and was subdued in a single, humiliating exchange.",

    "content": "Chapter 109: A Match Made in Heaven (4)\nChu Il-hwan calmed the raging homicidal impulse within him and spoke with a smile while veins bulged on his forehead.\n“And you still feel that way, even knowing you could be demoted to the Lower Class?”\nEven as he asked, Chu Il-hwan felt something was strange about the situation.\nUnder normal circumstances, Dokgo Pae would never fall to the Lower Class.\nIf you removed Il-mok from the equation, Dokgo Pae was easily the strongest among his peers.\nThe problem was that martial skill was all he had.\n‘If it weren’t for the Young Master, he’d probably be competing with Bang Mi-hwa for the top spot.’\nBang Mi-hwa was a couple of steps behind Dokgo Pae in raw martial skill, but she consistently maintained good scores across the board. Dokgo Pae, on the other hand, was focused solely on combat.\nIf Il-mok hadn't been there, the two of them would have likely spurred each other on, creating a healthy rivalry.\nBut Il-mok was an ecosystem-destroying invasive species.\nUnlike Bang Mi-hwa, who used every trick in the book to avoid a direct confrontation with Il-mok and secure her grades, Dokgo Pae charged head-on every single time, only to be utterly crushed.\nAs a result, his grades continued to plummet. He was eliminated so pathetically early each time that it was impossible to give him a good evaluation no matter how skilled he was in martial arts.\nBut even as Chu Il-hwan exercised his patience and showed a shred of pity, Dokgo Pae’s answer remained the same.\n\"If one is a martial artist of the Divine Cult, shouldn't one naturally seek answers through martial might?\"\n\"...I understand your intentions, so you may leave now.\"\nRealizing there was no more advice he could give, Chu Il-hwan had no choice but to issue an order to leave.\nIf he continued conversing with that stubborn fool any longer, he would bring dishonor to Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi by murdering a student before he even got the tails of the rats hiding in this place.\nI hadn’t been lounging in the corner of the training grounds for long when I saw Dokgo Pae emerge from the pavilion after his meeting with Instructor Chu Il-hwan.\nAnd for some reason, Dokgo Pae was glaring at me as if he wanted to kill me.\n‘What’s with the crazy eyes now?’\nYesterday's incident suddenly came to mind.\nThe sight of Dokgo Pae charging at me with his eyes frenzied the moment the test began.\nBack then too, I had gotten goosebumps all over my body and swung my sword to subdue Dokgo Pae.\nThe only reason why I didn’t beat this bastard half dead is that the memories of the fiasco with Mak Ho-yeol were still fresh in my mind.\nI get the feeling that this crazy bastard is the same kind of pervert as Mak Ho-yeol who would grin blissfully with every blow delivered.\nI had decided it was best not to associate with perverts, so I’d been trying to ignore him.\n‘He’s going to burn a hole through my skull at this rate.’\nDokgo Pae spent the remaining class time staring holes through my skull.\nAnd that afternoon.\nAfter classes ended, I finished bathing and headed to the dining hall...\n\"Young Master Il-mok!\"\nThat perverted bastard finally caught me.\nI had no intention of managing my expression, so I looked at him like I was looking at a bug, but he seemed utterly oblivious to my disgust.\n\"Please give me one more chance.\"\n\"...What chance are you talking about?\"\nI hadn't given this man any chances, ever.\n\"Just like what you did for Brother Mak, please give me guidance too.\"\n\".......\"\nSo that was it. Just like Mak Ho-yeol, he wanted to be beaten to a messy pulp.\n\"I refuse.\"\nI had more than enough desire to pummel him, but hitting someone who enjoyed it wasn’t punishment; it was a reward.\nDokgo Pae, who somehow looked even more perverted than before, spoke with a grave expression.\n“Then, at least, please tell me one thing. How can I become as strong as you, Young Master?\"\nIt was an unexpected question. Normally, I would have just ignored him and walked on, but a useful idea sparked in my mind.\n\"I'll teach you, but there's a condition.\"\n\"A condition? What is it?\"\n“From now until we graduate from the Hall of the Demonic Way, and unless explicitly told by the instructors, never request a duel with me.”\nThis was my chance to peel this leech off for good.\nUnder the condition I presented, Dokgo Pae made a face as if he might fall into Qi Deviation and fell into deep thought.\n\"How could you...\"\nBut that was brief.\nDokgo Pae seemed to have made a decision and answered with a serious expression.\n\"I agree.\"\nThough Dokgo Pae accepted the proposal, one problem remained.\n‘What the hell am I supposed to tell him?’\nHow did I become strong?\n‘I just got stronger naturally from having to deal with all these psychos…?’\nFrom my Master and Jin Hayeon to Jang Hwi’s ambush. Baek Cheon’s rampage, Chu Il-hwan’s attack, and even the senile Peach Blossom Ridge Lord.\nI’d been forced to become strong simply by surviving the endless barrage of weirdos.\nBut I couldn’t just tell him that.\n‘He’s already crazy about fighting as he is, and if he hears this kind of story, he’ll forget any promise he made and start ambushing me every damn day.’\nAfter much deliberation, I decided to sell him some snake oil instead of telling the truth. Thɪs chapter is updated by novelꞁire.net\n“What is strength, in your opinion, Disciple Dokgo?”\nMy sudden question drew a strange look from him.\n“Strength is strength. What else would it be?”\n\"So you think just swinging a sword powerfully is strength?\"\n\"Though I may be the eldest son of the Dokgo family, I do not believe a strong sword is the only measure of strength. Isn't high martial arts mastery what strength is?\"\n“And why do you think that?”\nAs our conversation continued like a Zen riddle, Dokgo Pae tilted his head but answered with pure sincerity.\n\"Because I believe in our Divine Cult's doctrine. To punish the wicked who torment the common folk with martial might, doesn't the strongest person rise to the position of Cult Leader?\"\nAt Dokgo Pae's answer, I cheered internally. This was exactly how I expected these cult fanatics to respond.\n\"You're only half right. Our Divine Cult's doctrine aims to punish the wicked who torment the common folk. Its purpose is not martial arts itself. Martial arts are merely a tool.”\n\"!!!\"\n“In our Divine Cult, strength means the ability to better punish those wicked people. The Cult Leader is the one who can punish them most effectively. That is why the strongest ascends to the throne.”\nMy little wordplay seemed to have sparked some sort of epiphany in Dokgo Pae, yet he also looked utterly confused.\n“Th-then what am I supposed to do?”\n“Well, obviously, you have to use your head, don’t you?”\nI said, tapping my temple. He asked back, “Do you mean I should use my head to headbutt my opponents?”\n\".......\"\nI was speechless at the ignorant answer, but barely managed to collect myself and replied, “No, not that. I mean you need to use your head in how you approach the exams.”\n\"If one is truly strong, wouldn't it be enough to solve everything with power without needing to use one's head? If I lose, it's simply because my skills were lacking.\"\n\"Tsk. And you call yourself a member of the great Heavenly Demon Divine Cult? Think of it as a real battle, not a test. You train yourself in martial arts to punish the wicked who torment the common folk, but what if you die? Are you going to say, ‘Ah, my skills were lacking.’ And dropped dead, is that it? You must win at all costs.”\nAs the words left my mouth, memories from my past life as a civil servant came flooding back.\n—Is ‘sorry’ all you have to say!? You have to do something about it!\n—You take our tax money and you can’t even do this? A bunch of thieves, the lot of you!\nThe shouts of entitled citizens demanding benefits they didn’t qualify for echoed in my ears.\nAs they railed against me, my superiors were busy pretending not to see, and I was left to find solutions within my capacity, as my superiors certainly had no intention of taking any responsibility themselves.\nLooking back now, I wonder if those troublesome bastards weren't poor common folks but the wicked ones.\nAs I was lost in those dark memories, Dokgo Pae asked with a conflicted expression. “But… even if it is for the sake of the people, how can a warrior of the Divine Cult resort to such underhanded tricks…?”\n“Even if you have no intention of using such tricks yourself, it’s all the same. You must use your head to avoid falling victim to them. Have you forgotten what happened to you in the first test?”\n\"Ah!!\"\nA cry of realization escaped him as he finally remembered being ambushed while eating.\nI continued speaking to drive the point home.\n“The same goes for your martial arts. From what I’ve seen, you’re only interested in your own techniques and pay no attention to your opponent's martial arts.\"\n\"Well, if I can just swing stronger and faster, I can win, can't I?\"\n\"Tsk. Even if you swing with the same strength and speed, between hitting where the opponent is prepared and hitting where they don't expect, which one works better?\"\nDokgo Pae nodded seriously.\n\"I'll say it again, use your head. Even if you have no intention of using ambushes or joint attacks, practice for situations where you might be ambushed or face joint attacks. The same goes for martial arts. If you observe and analyze your opponent's martial arts, you'll find things to learn.\"\n\"I will engrave your teachings deep in my heart, Young Master.\"\nDokgo Pae bowed to me with a serious face, then turned around refreshingly and headed somewhere.\nWatching his retreating back disappear into the distance, I thought, ‘I just fed him a bunch of bullshits, but I’m sure it’ll work out somehow.’\nI had no idea if using his head would actually make him stronger.\nBut I’m sure that if he used his head, his exam scores would improve. He’d probably stop getting eliminated right at the start by blindly charging in.\n‘And if not, whatever.’\nAs long as that guy doesn't come looking for me anymore, that's enough. Whether his skills improved or not was none of my business.\nRight after Dokgo Pae left, Il-mok headed for the clearing, thinking, ‘So, Chu Il-hwan is the only one I have to watch out for now?’\nIt was a subtle feeling.\nMak Ho-yeol and Dokgo Pae were, at the very least, weaker than him.\nUntil now, he had avoided them because he didn't want to get involved with perverts and was worried about the side effects of drawing his sword unnecessarily. They weren’t opponents he feared.\nBut Chu Il-hwan was different.\n‘I should avoid him as much as possible from now on.’\nJust as Il-mok made that resolution, a dark shadow, hidden by stealth techniques, was watching him.\nAfter getting advice from Il-mok, Dokgo Pae hurried off to find his sworn brother, Mak Ho-yeol, to share what he had learned.\n\"Brother Mak! I’ve just heard something wonderful from Young Master Il-mok!\"\nAfter his beating from Il-mok, Mak Ho-yeol had realized his own shortcomings and had been dedicating himself to training.\nHe felt it would be disrespectful to challenge Il-mok again without improving his skills first.\nSince this was news about the man he had set as his goal, Mak Ho-yeol’s interest was naturally piqued.\n“From Junior Il-mok, you say? Hahaha! I’m quite curious to hear what it is.”\n\"What Young Master Il-mok taught me was the secret of strength, Brother Mak.\"\n\"Really! What is that secret?\"\nAt Mak Ho-yeol's question, Dokgo Pae's lips curled into a smirk and answered.\n\"Young Master Il-mok said to use your head.\"\nAt Dokgo Pae's overly brief explanation, Mak Ho-yeol tilted his head.\n“Does he mean I should use my head to headbutt my opponents?”\nSworn brothers indeed.",

    "content": "Chapter 110: A Match Made in Heaven (5)\nHidden from Il-mok as he headed to the clearing.\n'Hoh. I never thought such persuasion would work.'\nChu Il-hwan, who had been observing the area around Il-mok under Yeom Ga-hwi’s orders, watched with gleaming eyes. He tended to leave the cadets alone during scheduled training hours, but he would secretly monitor them during the free practice time in the evening. He had even been the one to personally watch over Il-mok during the exams.\n‘To think that the stubborn and boarish Dokgo Pae would be swayed so easily.’\nChu Il-hwan, who had overheard the entire conversation between Dokgo Pae and Il-mok, wore a peculiar expression.\nAs an instructor at the Hall of the Demonic Way, he knew quite a bit about the Dokgo Family.\nThe ancestor of the Dokgo family, one of the Five Great Demonic Families, had been a chieftain of northern nomadic tribes.\nAs was typical of nomadic tribes, wars between tribes were commonplace, and their battles were usually fought between cavalry units.\nIn a cavalry charge, the most crucial element was the ability to break through. They had to defeat those blocking their path in a single exchange and pierce straight through enemy lines. The moment they hesitated or got blocked, they would be trapped in enemy territory and face impending doom.\nThat's why the Dokgo family's martial arts focused entirely on offense and emphasized the principle of strength.\nHowever, the Dokgo Family's ancestors were eventually pushed out in the power struggles between tribes and driven to the Central Plains. At that time, they took refuge with the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, which hadn't yet been branded as a traitorous organization and still remained in the Central Plains.\nThe founding head of the family, who received a Central Plains surname from the cult leader of that time and adopted the surname 'Dokgo,' studied various Demonic Arts of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nHe then combined the principles of the Demonic Arts with the martial techniques he had originally learned, and finally succeeded in creating the ultimate technique known as the Nine Swords of Solitude.\n(TL Note: Dokgo could be translated as solitude. From now on, I’ll use the term interchangeably with Dokgo’s Nine Sword when needed.)\nIt was a historic moment that gave birth to a demonic art which preserved the unique characteristic of a strength-type sword style, yet allowed for much faster growth and the generation of far greater strength. And fittingly, it came with the side effect of making its practitioner dogmatic and pig-headed.\nDuring a cavalry charge, a moment of hesitation or stray thoughts would get you trapped and killed. It was a fitting side effect for martial arts where the only correct answer was to press forward believing only in yourself without any hesitation.\nOver the following centuries, the Nine Swords of Solitude evolved gradually, but the core framework remained largely unchanged.\nThanks to the transformation from tribal chieftain to martial artist, there was slightly more emphasis on utilizing footwork rather than fighting on horseback.\nThe offense-focused strength-based swordsmanship remained the same, and the side effects of becoming stubborn and obstinate also remained unchanged.\nKnowing this fact, Chu Il-hwan had given up on persuading Dokgo Pae.\nHe feared that if he tried, the side effects of his own Black Thunder Demonic Palm would flare up and he would end up killing the boy.\nYet Il-mok had succeeded in persuading that stubborn Dokgo Pae.\nWhile it might seem absurd that Dokgo Pae, who wouldn't listen to his words as an instructor, was persuaded by Il-mok's words, Chu Il-hwan wasn't particularly bothered by it.\nAfter more than five years as an instructor, it was something he had grown accustomed to.\nStrangely enough, children of that age were more influenced by words from their peers than from adults.\nFrom that perspective, Il-mok's existence was quite special.\nHis outstanding skills, his status as the Heavenly Demon's disciple, and the various achievements he had shown even before entering the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nHe was bound to exert a great influence on the students.\n‘It’s not limited to just the students he directly influenced, like Ju Seo-yeon, Jeong Hyeon, and Baek Cheon. The average skill of all the students is growing much faster than in previous years.’\nAs an instructor, this was a reality he was experiencing firsthand.\nYet, even after witnessing Il-mok persuade Dokgo Pae with his own eyes, Chu Il-hwan’s expression remained ambiguous.\n'The more I observe him, the stranger this fellow becomes.'\nThe reason he made this assessment was due to the scenes he had witnessed while seriously monitoring Il-mok.\nToday, as well, he had secretly followed Il-mok to the clearing.\nAnd as always, the clearing was already filled with activity.\n‘I have no idea what they’re doing in the Hall of the Demonic Way, a place meant to cultivate the talent of our cult.’\nFollowing Jeong Hyeon's archery demonstration, they took turns sparring.\n‘I’m sure I clearly forbade personal sparring among disciples.’\nFrom an instructor's perspective, what was happening in that clearing was an absolute mess.\nBut the part that bothered Chu Il-hwan the most was something else entirely.\n'No matter how talented he is, how can he be so lazy?'\nIl-mok, upon arriving at the clearing, only moved his mouth a few times.\nHe was, quite literally, doing nothing at all.\nHe simply sat in a corner, just watching the others.\nSometimes he would close his eyes, making Chu Il-hwan wonder if he was perhaps cultivating his internal energy.\n\"Snore... Zzzzz...\"\nBut when Chu Il-hwan takes a closer look...\nHe was just snoring and dozing off.\n‘…I knew he was slacking off during class, but I thought there had to be a reason for it.’\nConsidering the Young Master’s exceptional achievements, he had thought it was impossible for Il-mok to neglect his training.\nBut now he realized it was his own misconception.\nHowever, what grated on Chu Il-hwan's nerves the most was a different matter.\n‘I knew he had an eye for the ladies, but I never imagined it was to this extent.’\nAfter confirming the identities of those gathered at the clearing, Chu Il-hwan couldn’t help but be shocked for several reasons.\nExcept for Baek Cheon, there were only women.\nAnd since Baek Cheon was from a senior class, it meant that among his own peers, Il-mok was only associating with women.\n'There are only six female students in his year, yet he's drawn in four of them. What’s more, all three women from the Upper Class are with him?!?'\nChu Il-hwan had a thought. He wondered if Il-mok was trying to turn this clearing into his own personal harem.\nA few more months, and Baek Cheon would graduate from the Hall of the Demonic Way, leaving Il-mok as the only man.\nIf Il-mok then managed to entice the new female disciples as well, it wouldn’t be strange at all to see a true den of debauchery unfold here.\n‘Once I deal with the rats, he’s going to get some proper education.’\nHe had to turn a blind eye for now, as he couldn’t let it be known that he was monitoring Il-mok.\nOriginally, Chu Il-hwan had no intention of criticizing Il-mok for being fond of women.\nThe tenets of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult did not forbid taking three wives and four concubines, after all.\nHowever, that was only when one was making efforts to become stronger according to the doctrine.\nSeeing him lounging around while only chasing after women, he couldn't just leave it alone.\nMaybe because he was contemplating how to discipline Il-mok.\nFlicker.\nThe moment Chu Il-hwan's sharp gaze turned toward Il-mok.\nSnap.\nIl-mok, who had been snoring in his sleep, snapped his eyes open and looked directly toward where Chu Il-hwan was hiding.\n\"Hmm? What's that?\"\nSensing something, Il-mok tilted his head in confusion, then closed his eyes again to go back to sleep.\nChu Il-hwan, who had come precariously close to having his surveillance exposed, let out an inward sigh and thought.\n‘…How can a kid that lazy be so damn skilled?’\nIf he were this good while being so lazy, just how far would he grow if properly driven?\nWhile Chu Il-hwan was imagining cleaning up the troublesome rats in the school and disciplining Il-mok to his heart's content.\nIl-mok, who had been napping for a while, trembled as if having a nightmare.\nA few days had passed since Dokgo Pae received Il-mok’s advice.\nDokgo Pae shared the advice with his sworn brother, Mak Ho-yeol, and they tried to put their heads together to figure it out.\nHowever, they soon encountered a major problem.\nThose who have used their heads before are good at using them.\nBut when those two fools tried to think, all they found was a vague emptiness.\nFor example, when they tried to practice a scenario where they were being ambushed.\n\"Hahaha! Try blocking this too, brother!\"\nDespite it being an ambush, both Mak Ho-yeol and Dokgo Pae would shout at the top of their lungs as they swung their weapons.\nTheir martial arts were the same.\nIt was the same with their martial arts. The two had been training together for nearly three months, so they were already familiar with each other’s techniques. Furthermore, since both of their styles focused on straightforward attacks, there was no opportunity to exploit weaknesses or use their heads. Thıs text ıs hosted at N0veI.Fiɾe.net\n\"Brother Dokgo.\"\n\"Yes, Brother Mak.\"\n“Does it seem like nothing’s changed to you?”\n\"I feel it too.\"\nAs simple as they were, they had just enough sense to slowly realize something was wrong.\n\"It seems difficult for just the two of us to create change, don't you think?\"\n\"That's right, Brother Mak.\"\nNaturally, they reached a certain conclusion.\nThey needed to use their heads, but they didn’t have any.\nIf that was the case, shouldn’t they just borrow someone else’s head?\nAs Dokgo Pae pondered this, a face popped into his mind.\n\"Ah! I know of one useful fellow, Brother Mak.\"\n\"A useful fellow?\"\n\"Yes. I've been with him several times during tests. His skills were nothing special, but he seemed to have a pretty good head on his shoulders.”\nIn fact, Instructor Chu Il-hwan had given him advice after the first test. Advice about utilizing 'that student.'\nFor that very purpose, they had even been placed in the same group for the second test.\nHowever, there was one problem that Instructor Chu Il-hwan hadn't anticipated.\nThe martial arts tournament that took place after the first test.\nAfter that sparring tournament, Dokgo Pae had received special training from Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi for about a month, thanks to Il-mok's concession.\nOn top of that, he had become sworn brothers with Mak Ho-yeol and devoted himself daily to training while discussing martial arts together.\nThanks to those two things, Dokgo Pae was able to achieve great progress in his martial arts.\nWhile it was nothing compared to the Young Master’s growth rate, the Nine Swords of Solitude had indeed advanced.\nAnd as much as his proficiency in the Nine Swords of Solitude increased, the side effects also strengthened.\n'If you're a warrior of the cult, face your challenge head-on! Strength is the only truth!’\nWith such thoughts filling his head, Dokgo Pae had completely forgotten about Chu Il-hwan's advice and all thoughts of 'that student.'\nBut the advice from Il-mok, his only rival and goal, had managed to influence Dokgo Pae even through the fog of his side effects.\nFinally, Dokgo Pae succeeded in recalling the forgotten memory.\n“I’ll go get him right now, Brother Mak!”\nTrue to a man who practiced the Nine Swords of Solitude, Dokgo Pae shot to his feet the moment the words left his mouth.\nDokgo Pae began searching through the Hall of the Demonic Way, even using lightness skills.\n“There you are!”\nSpotting the one he was looking for, Dokgo Pae grabbed the disciple by the scruff of his neck without a second thought and dashed back to where Mak Ho-yeol was waiting.\n\"Gah...\"\nThe student who was dragged away by the scruff of his neck let out a breathless, choked gasp.\nThe man whom Dokgo Pae suddenly kidnapped could only come to his senses after Dokgo Pae finally let him go.\nWhat that man saw was the sight of two boarish and fierce-looking men staring down at him.\n\"Gulp...\"\nSwallowing dryly without realizing it, the man asked in a trembling voice.\n“I-Is there… s-something you n-need from me?”\n\"From now on, you'll become our brain.\"\n\"???\"\nAt that abrupt explanation, which cut out all context, the disciple abducted by Dokgo Pae—Gwak Sul—stared back with a blank face.\nBut it was only for a moment. The bewildered Gwak Sul soon collected himself and began to ask calmly.\n\"What exactly do you mean by becoming your brain?\"\nAfter calmly conversing with Dokgo Pae and Mak Ho-yeol, Gwak Sul was able to understand the situation.\n'It was because of Young Master Il-mok's advice.'\nGwak Sul realized the true culprit behind his kidnapping.",

But the two fools had already begun swinging their weapons as if they were prepared to be ambushed.\n\".......\"\nGwak Sul watched them with a dumbfounded expression for a moment before letting out a light sigh and deploying his stealth technique.\nThanks to the four months of training under Instructor Eun Ryeo, Gwak Sul had become somewhat capable of erasing his presence.\nHow long had Gwak Sul been hiding while concealing his presence?\nDokgo Pae, who had been completely lost in his family’s martial arts, lowered his great sword to his side and shouted with a scowl.\n\"How long are you going to—!”\nHe never finished the sentence.\nThe instant he opened his mouth, Gwak Sul’s spear shot out in a surprise attack.\n“Hup!?”\nStartled, Dokgo Pae immediately stopped speaking and twisted his body, barely dodging the spear.\n“You! What a dirty trick!\"\n\"Hahahaha! Brother Dokgo has brought quite a useful comrade!\"\nMak Ho-yeol bellowed from the side, his voice booming with what sounded suspiciously like a compliment.\n\"Haa!\"\nAfter dodging the first strike, Dokgo Pae launched his counterattack, and Gwak Sul collapsed before he could even last ten exchanges.\n“Dammit…”\n“Junior Gwak, you’ve got a good head on your shoulders, but you’re just too weak.” A look of genuine pity crossed the faces of the two intimidating brutes as they loomed over him.\nGwak Sul was a talent worthy of entering the Hall of the Demonic Way, so he was far from being truly \"weak.\"\nHowever, in terms of martial prowess alone, he couldn't compare to Mak Ho-yeol and Dokgo Pae, who were second place in their respective cohorts.\n“Brother, I’m thinking we should just get his help with strategy during the exams. For now, we need to bulk him up.”\n“My thoughts exactly, Brother Dokgo.”\nHaving reached an instant agreement, the two hauled the sprawling Gwak Sul to his feet.\n\"Still not enough! Here, strap on this leather pouch and try swinging your spear!”\n\"Build up your muscles first. If you lack strength, you can't properly utilize your internal energy!\"\nAnd just like that, they began putting Gwak Sul through the wringer.\nSeveral days later.\nBaek Cheon and Mak Ho-yeol's cohort, who had been staying at the Hall of the Demonic Way for over a month, left for their next practical training.\nBut even after they were gone…\n\"Stronger!! Faster!!\"\nDokgo Pae, for some reason, is still diligently drilling Gwak Sul.\n\"Ohohohoh!\"\nAnd for some reason, Bang Mi-hwa was still completely lost in her world of acting.\nWith the departure of the senior year, the clearing was now home to only Il-mok and the four female students.\nAnd for some reason, from that day forward, Il-mok found himself getting sudden chills while he napped.\n'What's this? Is this place running low on yang energy now that the other guy is gone?’\nIl-mok grimaced at the thought.\n‘Heh. I’m really starting to think like a person of this era. Since when did I start believing in things like yin-yang and the five elements?'\nThen again, in a world where things like qi, internal energy, martial arts, formations, and incantations were all very real, denying yin and yang felt just as foolish.\nIl-mok closed his eyes again to try to sleep, dismissing such trivial thoughts.\nShiver.\nHe was plunged into a nightmare of being chased by Chu Il-hwan\nA few more days trickled by, and the fifth test was upon them.\nLike the first two exams, this one was conducted in teams, and Gwak Sul and Dokgo Pae were grouped together.\n“You gave me your word that you would follow my orders, Team Leader Dokgo.”\nWas it a result of being tormented by Mak Ho-yeol and Dokgo Pae? As Gwak Sul spoke, there was a hard glint in his eyes that hadn't been there before.\nBut Dokgo Pae seemed to like that look and laughed heartily.\n“Hahaha! Don’t mention it, Disciple Gwak! I’m the one who went to Instructor Chu Il-hwan and asked for us to be a team after all!”\nAs Dokgo Pae said, he had asked Chu Il-hwan to pair him with Gwak Sul.\nAnd Chu Il-hwan had gladly granted that request to prevent Dokgo Pae's reckless behavior.\nRemembering this, Dokgo Pae’s face lit up with anticipation. “So, tell me! What’s the plan to fight Young Master Il-mok?”\nAt Dokgo Pae's question, Seong Hwan from the Upper Class and the female disciple from the Lower Class of their team let out deep sighs.\nHe wanted to fight the Young Master right off the bat. This exam was doomed.\nBut surprisingly, it was Gwak Sul who stopped that bulldozer.\n\"We plan to face Il-mok's team last. Survival should come first, shouldn't it?\"\n\"But....\"\nBefore Dokgo Pae could argue, Gwak Sul cut him off.\n“You said it yourself, didn’t you, Team Leader? That you wanted to learn how to use your head to get as strong as Young Master Il-mok. In that case, you will follow my orders. If you don’t, you will never catch up to him.”\n\"!!!\"\nAt those words, which bordered on harsh criticism, Seong Hwan and the female disciple nearby looked at Gwak Sul with expressions full of surprise and worry.\nThey were sure he was about to be pulverized.\nIndeed, Dokgo Pae's face had turned bright red and his body was trembling as if he might draw his sword at any moment.\nYet even facing this terrifying sight, Gwak Sul’s expression remained strangely placid.\n‘Go on. Hit me. I'd rather get beaten up this time and just end it.'\nThat was Gwak Sul's inner thoughts.\nRather than continue enduring what he'd suffered these past few days, Gwak Sul wanted to just get beaten up once and be done with it.\nHowever, his expectations were shattered.\nDokgo Pae, whose face had turned red with anger, suddenly burst into hearty laughter as if some other thought had occurred to him.\n\"Hahahaha! Disciple Gwak has finally become a true man! Yes! A man must be willing to put his life on the line for what he believes!”\nThough Dokgo Pae laughed heartily, the expressions of Seong Hwan and the female disciple, who had been listening to their conversation were strange.\n‘…So you have to risk your life just to disagree with him.’\n‘…He was actually going to kill him.’\nTo think he would try to kill someone just for stopping him from fighting the Young Master.\nThere was no longer any doubt; the man was completely insane.\nOn the other hand, Gwak Sul let out a sigh with a bitter expression.\n'I wish he'd just hit me and be done with it.'\nHis face grew cold as he gave instructions with an indifferent expression.\n“We’re moving. Staying in one place for too long will give away our position.”\n\"Where should we go?\"\nAs if he’d had a plan all along, Gwak Sul answered Dokgo Pae’s question without hesitation. “From what I saw before we scattered, Young Master Il-mok’s team headed east. To avoid them, we should…”\nGwak Sul thought to himself that this exam would be won by whichever team encountered Il-mok's team last anyway.\nThe judgment had already been made in the previous exam. The Young Master was simply in a different league from the other disciples.\nIt didn’t matter that his team this time was made up entirely of Lower Class students. Gwak Sul was certain Il-mok could take on all four of them by himself.\nWith the stubborn and impulsive Dokgo Pae following his orders to the letter, the other two team members soon began to look to Gwak Sul for direction as well.\nHow long had they been moving around the exam grounds while hiding their traces?\n\"I've found tracks.\"\nGwak Sul, who had found a team that didn't include the Young Master, gave detailed instructions.\n\"Attack!\"\n\"Hahahaha!! Hand over your tokens immediately!\"\nThe instant Gwak Sul gave the word, Dokgo Pae bellowed and charged forward with a roar.\nSeong Hwan and the female disciple, who were hidden on the flanks for the ambush, looked back and forth between the reckless Dokgo Pae and the calm Gwak Sul who gave instructions from behind.\n‘They are truly a match made in heaven.’\nThe day after the exam ended.\n\"Congratulations, Disciple Dokgo.\"\nIt was their usual meeting, but this time, the words that came out of Chu Il-hwan’s mouth were praise.\nFirst place had gone to Il-mok, as expected. However, breaking everyone's expectations, Dokgo Pae secured second place again.\nIt was thanks to following Gwak Sul's instructions.\nAfter ambushing and subduing one team, Gwak Sul had them focus solely on fleeing for a while.\nThanks to this, while Il-mok swept away all the remaining teams, they could last the longest and even set up traps before fighting Il-mok’s team.\nIn the end, Il-mok had wiped the floor with them all, but not before they had managed to defeat the other three members of his team, securing them a high score.\nThe man who had actually earned second place, however, looked anything but satisfied.\n\"I'm still lacking, Instructor.\"\nIn the final battle, he had been defeated by Il-mok without lasting even three exchanges.\nThis was despite following Gwak Sul's instructions and even launching a surprise attack from an ambush.\n“Even so, you’ve grown considerably. It’s a fine result. Reflect on your shortcomings and aim for the next exam.\"\n\"Actually, I'm planning to meet with Disciple Gwak this afternoon to do just that.”\nSeeing the fire burning in Dokgo Pae’s eyes, Chu Il-hwan had a thought.\n‘Gwak Sul, was it?’\nChu Il-hwan began to feel sorry for that disciple.\nThat afternoon.\n\"Disciple Gwak!!\"\nTrue to his word, Dokgo Pae set out to kidnap Gwak Sul.\n\"Sigh. I'm here.\"\nWhen Gwak Sul, who had already accepted his fate, answered with a sigh, Dokgo Pae asked, “What were your thoughts on yesterday’s exam?”\n\"I think Young Master Il-mok is truly incredible.\"\n“No, not that! You were watching my duel with the Young Master from behind, weren’t you? Did you notice any weaknesses in my martial arts, or did you feel anything about Young Master Il-mok's martial arts?\"\nThe two began discussing martial arts. What started as a simple conversation about Il-mok turned into a review of all the battles from the exam.\nAfter talking for quite a while.\n\"This won't work.\"\n\"???\"\n\"You may have a good head, but your body is the problem! Your analysis is excellent, but you can't apply it because you can't physically demonstrate it!\"\n“Excuse me?”\nHow in the world am I supposed to replicate the swordsmanship of that monster?\n‘If I could do that, do you really think I’d be letting you drag me around like this?’\nWords boiled in Gwak Sul's throat, but he couldn't voice them.\n\"Come! Swing harder!\"\n\"Aaaaah!!\"\nBefore he could protest, Dokgo Pae’s hellish special training had begun all over again.\n'This is all because of the Young Master!'\nThough the source of all this trouble came to mind, he couldn't dare voice it.\nAs terrifying as Dokgo Pae was, Young Master Il-mok was far, far scarier.\n\"Is someone talking about me?\"\nIl-mok, who was crossing the Hall of the Demonic Way toward the clearing, muttered while picking at his ear.\nHe had just finished bathing, but his ear suddenly felt itchy, which was quite suspicious.\nJust then, a distant sound—half scream, half shout—reached his ears.\n\"Aaaaah!\"\nIl-mok turned his head toward that direction and nodded with a satisfied expression.\n'What a perfectly matched pair.'\nWhether before the exam or during the exam, Dokgo Pae and Gwak Sul had surprisingly good chemistry.\nMoreover, thanks to Dokgo Pae clinging to Gwak Sul, he no longer came looking for Il-mok, which was truly a pleasant sight to behold.\nIt never once crossed his mind that he was the cause of it all.\nLate at night, somewhere in the Hall of the Demonic Way.\n— Did that man continue to linger near the Young Master?\n—He did, sir.\nTwo figures, separated by a wall, conversed through sound transmissions.\n—As expected, it seems the Hall Master has caught on. To think he’d station his favorite pet dog by the Young Master’s side.\n—If you hadn't tipped us off, there would have been trouble.\nThe man leaning against the wall in the shadows nodded.\nSince the last incident, they had been cautiously observing, just in case.\nDuring this time, an unshakable feeling of unease had prompted the man to investigate the Young Master’s surroundings, where he belatedly discovered Chu Il-hwan’s constant presence near the Young Master.\nIt was only possible because the man's caution and cultivation were higher than Chu Il-hwan’s.\nRight after that, the man informed his follower of this fact.\nWhile the man was recalling that incident, a sound transmission came from beyond the wall.\n—Were there any separate instructions from that person?\n—...He said that surveillance might tighten due to the recent incident and advised us to cease contact for the time being. He told us to handle the situation on-site, at our own discretion.\nThe man who sent the sound transmission gritted his teeth silently.\n“Discretion” sounded nice to say, but it really meant they were already half-abandoned due to the previous failure.\nIf they couldn’t deal with the Young Master before he graduated, they wouldn’t just be half-abandoned; they’d be cut loose completely.\n‘I will not waste my life teaching brats.’\nHe was not content with his current station.\nWhen the current Heavenly Demon ascended, that person would rise to become the next Cult Leader. If he succeeded in this mission, his own position would rise far higher.\nThe problem was that the infuriatingly inflexible damn Hall Master and his pet dog had somewhat caught on.\n'The Hall Master often leaves his post, but that pet dog… how can I…’\nThey say where there's a will, there's a way.\nWhile the man was deep in thought, an idea occurred to him.\n‘What if… instead of eliminating the pet dog… we used him?’",

    "content": "Chapter 112: Rampage (1)\nMore than five months had already passed since I’d entered the Hall of the Demonic Way. Just a little longer and I’d hit the half-year mark.\nI let my mind and body drift on the cool breeze, lazily flicking my sword through the air.\nThe whole world just felt like a chore.\n'Nice weather.'\nYawning languidly while my sword traced aimless patterns in the air, I felt like I just wanted to lie down right there and take a nap.\n\"Seeing how relaxed you are, it seems this instructor will have to test you in a duel.”\nIf only it weren't for Chu Il-hwan's voice reaching my ears at that moment.\n'Tch.'\nI clicked my tongue inwardly and quickly straightened my posture.\n\"You're mistaken, Instructor. I was merely reflecting on my insights, swinging slowly to gather my thoughts.”\nWhen I said this to Instructor Chu Il-hwan, he flashed his signature smile while watching from beyond the human barrier.\n\"Ho. Insights, you say.\"\nBut for some reason, despite the smile on his lips, the vein on his forehead was throbbing violently.\n‘Is he going through menopause or something? He’s been especially sensitive lately.’\nHe is a bit young for dementia to hit him, but since he was someone who had spent his whole life cultivating Demonic Arts, it wouldn’t be strange for mental issues to arrive early, right?\n‘Or maybe… he’s sexually frustrated?’\nA shiver went down my spine as I recalled Chu Il-hwan’s particular tastes.\n‘Come to think of it, I’ve been getting the chills a lot lately… Don’t tell me…’\nA suddenly ominous thought crossed my mind.\nWhat if this crazy pervert is secretly stalking me?\nMy eyes naturally narrowed as I looked at Chu Il-hwan with suspicion.\n\"What's with that look? You want to have a go with me?\"\nHis smile widened as black lightning crackled to life in his right hand.\nI had to force myself to look away.\n'You don't avoid shit because you're scared of it. You avoid it because it's disgusting.'\nAnd right now, Chu Il-hwan was the one piece of shit I absolutely had to steer clear of.\n‘That Dokgo Pae fellow seems to be keeping his promise, at least.’\nEver since I gave him that advice, he hadn't challenged me to a duel unless it was during an exam or under an instructor’s orders.\nFor some reason, a cadet named Gwak Sul was being dragged around by Dokgo Pae in my place, but that wasn't my concern.\n'I don't think I need to visit that clearing anymore either.'\nFour women—Jeong Hyeon, Ju Seo-yeon, Bang Mi-hwa, and Ha Young—were training together and refining their acting skills.\nTo be precise, the acting was pretty much just Bang Mi-hwa’s solo performance. Ha Young clapped enthusiastically from the side while Jeong Hyeon and Ju Seo-yeon were little more than stage props.\nAnyway, what mattered was that after spending about a month together in the clearing, Jeong Hyeon had more or less grown accustomed to the other three.\n'Bang Mi-hwa is obsessed with acting, and Dokgo Pae is with Gwak Sul. There's no one else chasing after me, so I really don't need to go to that clearing anymore, right?'\nDid true peace finally arrive upon me?\n'Good. From today on, I'll just hole up in the Black Dragon Pavilion.'\nThe thought that my dream life at the Hall of the Demonic Way was finally about to begin filled me with glee.\nThat afternoon.\nAs usual, Jeong Hyeon was the first to arrive at the secluded clearing.\n\"Nom.\"\nShe took a bite of the rice ball she pulled from her bosom and looked up at the blue sky.\nDue to the side effects of her Ghostly Spirit Divine Bow, she avoided crowded places, so after classes ended, she would always stop by the cafeteria to grab only rice balls and come to the clearing like this to eat alone.\nBeing near people made her nerves fray to an extreme degree; eating with someone else required an immense amount of courage.\nSetting aside the awkwardness, she would definitely get indigestion.\nStill, that didn’t mean she enjoyed eating alone like this every single day either.\n'...If we got a little closer, could we eat together?'\nShe saw Il-mok’s face overlap with the fluffy clouds drifting in the sky.\n‘If he was that far away, I think I’d be okay.’\nIf they ate together while he was as far away as those clouds, surely even she could enjoy a meal without feeling uncomfortable.\nNot knowing how far clouds actually were, she savored her rice ball alone while entertaining those silly thoughts. Thɪs chapter is updated by N()velFire.net\nJust as she finished eating and was rinsing her hands with water from her gourd, she sensed a presence at the clearing’s entrance.\n“Disciple Jeong Hyeon! I knew you’d be the first one here!”\nJeong Hyeon gave an awkward smile at the sight of the energetic Ju Seo-yeon.\nIt was partly because she was uncomfortable dealing with people, but also because of Il-mok's advice.\n'He told me to avoid being alone with her.'\nJeong Hyeon couldn't understand why Il-mok had given such advice.\nBut even without knowing the reason, she faithfully followed Il-mok's advice.\nThe moment the brightly smiling Ju Seo-yeon took a step closer, Jeong Hyeon took a step back.\nJu Seo-yeon remained cheerful despite the obvious avoidance.\n\"Ah! Going any further would make you uncomfortable! Hahaha! Then I'll stop here!\"\nShe already knew Jeong Hyeon had trouble being near people.\nShe plopped down right where she stood and looked up at the sky with a vacant expression.\n\"......\"\n\"......\"\nAn awkward silence naturally descended upon the clearing.\nIt might be different for someone who enjoyed being alone, but Jeong Hyeon wanted to be with people. She just couldn't because her constitution just wouldn’t allow it.\nAnd as is typical for people who want to be with others but have abysmal social skills, this kind of silence was suffocating.\nBecause it felt like it was her fault somehow.\n‘You can do it, Jeong Hyeon! You’ve practiced for this!’\nRecalling the memories of being tormented by the now-departed Baek Cheon, Jeong Hyeon mustered a lifetime of courage and opened her mouth.\n\"Wh-what are you thinking about?\"\nIt was a moment when she succeeded in something that would have made Baek Cheon pat her shoulders proudly, saying she'd grown wonderfully, and probably caused Jeong Hyeon to have a panic attack.\nStill staring into the sky, Ju Seo-yeon pointed a finger at a cloud and replied, “I was thinking of Miss Jin Hayeon. That cloud looks just like her.”\nSince Jin Hayeon was someone who had been with Il-mok before entering the Hall of the Demonic Way, Jeong Hyeon naturally became curious about her.\n\"J-Jin Hayeon... you mean the p-person who was I-Il-mok Young Master's s-servant?\"\nAnd that was the wrong topic to choose.\nJu Seo-yeon’s head snapped to the side at an unnatural angle, her gaze turning from the sky to lock onto Jeong Hyeon, her eyes shining with a brilliant light.\n\"You've heard about Miss Jin Hayeon! Hahaha. To speak of Miss Jin Hayeon is to speak of a beauty so profound it would be no exaggeration to call her a flower sculpted from the ice of a ten-thousand-year snow mountain. On the surface, she possesses a coldness and grace that seem utterly unapproachable, but that is merely her exterior! Within her breast beats a passion like the lava of a volcano! Is she not like the swans that swim upon a river? So elegant and proud on the surface, but beneath the water, she strives and devotes herself to overcoming the harsh storms of this world…”\nAn endless torrent of praise for Jin Hayeon poured from Ju Seo-yeon’s lips.\nJeong Hyeon listened to the incantation with a blank face as if hypnotized.\nShe was barely able to escape Ju Seo-yeon's brainwashing when she felt a presence at the clearing's entrance.\n\"Ohoho. What pleasant stories are you sharing?\"\nBang Mi-hwa snapped open her fan as she spoke. Jeong Hyeon breathed a sigh of relief upon seeing her.\nTo be honest, Bang Mi-hwa was an intimidating person for Jeong Hyeon.\nIt wasn't because of her haughty laughter or her self-centered behavior.\nThat was similar to Baek Cheon anyway, so it was a somewhat familiar personality.\nIt was just that ever since the incident in the bathhouse, she would often catch Bang Mi-hwa stealing glances at her, which made her uncomfortable.\nNevertheless, she was relieved by Bang Mi-hwa’s arrival, mostly because of who she expected to appear behind her.\n\"???\"\nBut for some reason, even though Bang Mi-hwa had arrived, Il-mok was nowhere to be seen. Only Ha Young was with her.\nWhile Jeong Hyeon was feeling puzzled, Ju Seo-yeon and Bang Mi-hwa began their conversation.\n\"I was talking about the woman I most admire. Hahaha.\"\n\"Oh my. You were discussing me.\"\n“Her name is Miss Jin Hayeon. She is an incredibly beautiful woman from the Hidden Guard Pavilion. Hahaha.”\n\"Hoohoo. There's no need to be so embarrassed, Ju Seo-yeon. You should blame my irresistible charm that captivates people regardless of age or gender. Hohoho.\"\nCould this even be called a conversation? They were exchanging such nonsensical dialogue.\nJeong Hyeon stared blankly at the festival of nonsense for a moment.\n'You can do it, Jeong Hyeon! You just did it a minute ago!\nShe repeated the mantra to herself and carefully opened her mouth.\n“Um… w-where did Young Master Il-mok go?”\nBang Mi-hwa, who had been in the middle of boasting about herself, snapped her fan shut as if just remembering something and answered.\n“Come to think of it, Young Master Il-mok won’t be coming here today. He said he had something else to do.”\n\"Pardon?\"\nJeong Hyeon was momentarily stunned by the unexpected news.\n\"......\"\nThen she belatedly realized that an awkward silence had fallen over the clearing once more.\n\"!?\"\nWhen she came to her senses, she saw Bang Mi-hwa staring intently at her.\n\"Come to think of it, today there's no Baek Cheon or Young Master Il-mok, so it's just us women.\"\nBang Mi-hwa, who was always so confident, suddenly covered her mouth slightly with her fan as she spoke.\n“So, as one woman to another, would you give me an honest answer, Disciple Jeong Hyeon?”\n“A-An honest answer about what?” Jeong Hyeon stammered back, trembling with an inexplicable sense of foreboding as Bang Mi-hwa boldly took a step forward.\nAs Jeong Hyeon stepped back by the same distance, Bang Mi-hwa spread her fan with a swoosh and pointed it at a certain part of Jeong Hyeon’s body.\n“That… what’s the secret?”\n\"!?\"\n“I. Am. Not. Asking, Because. I’m. Jealous. Understand? I’m merely asking because it might help with my acting.”\nWhat does that have to do with acting?\nThe question popped into her head, but her panicked mouth felt glued shut.\nIn that time, Ju Seo-yeon’s gaze, which had been lost in her own nonsensical ramblings, had also turned toward Jeong Hyeon.\n“Come to think of it, I’ve been very curious about that for a while now.”\nJu Seo-yeon suddenly stood up and began to creep slowly toward Jeong Hyeon.\n'Wh-why are your hands...?'\nSeeing Ju Seo-yeon's hands reaching forward as she approached, Jeong Hyeon suddenly remembered Il-mok's advice.\nTo never be alone with Ju Seo-yeon.\nMeanwhile, Ha Young was also approaching Jeong Hyeon to satisfy her curiosity.\n“It’s just us girls, so you can tell us comfortably.”\nA closing pincer formation of three women advancing from three directions.\nNormally, the sudden approach of so many people would have caused Jeong Hyeon to foam at the mouth and faint on the spot. But for some reason, she didn’t faint this time.\nHer instincts were screaming at her. A primal alarm bell warned her that if she fainted now, there was no telling what might happen.\nEven as she desperately wanted to have a fit and pass out…\n\"Hieek!\"\nJeong Hyeon let out a bizarre shriek. With an extreme act of will, she suppressed the oncoming fit and launched herself away using her lightness skill.\nPat!\nIt was the most perfect display of movement technique in her entire life.\n\"Hmm.\"\nA contented hum escaped Instructor Eun Ryeo’s lips as she savored the aroma of her tea on her quiet afternoon.\nFor her, who suffered from a rejection disorder that forced her to constantly wear a cold mask, these moments of solitary rest were a true pleasure.\nBut the faint smile on her face soon hardened, freezing over like a sheet of ice. Her senses had detected the subtle presence of someone stealthily approaching.\nNot wanting to show her relaxed face to anyone, she let out a faint sigh and spoke.\n\"Come in.\"\nJust from the presence alone, she knew who it was.\nThe moment she gave permission, the door opened, and the person she expected stepped inside.\nEver since Jeong Hyeon’s last panic attack at the clearing, Eun Ryeo had deliberately kept a distance from Jeong Hyeon due to her worry of triggering another bout of panic attacks.\nDespite her icy exterior, she couldn’t help the part of her that wanted to care for the pitiable girl.\nEun Ryeo, who had been sitting at the table to maintain a distance from Jeong Hyeon almost gasped in shock when she turned around.\nIt’s because Jeong Hyeon's face was deathly pale.\n\"...Did you run into a problem?\"\nBarely maintaining her composure, Jeong Hyeon trembled as she answered.\n\"I-I-I'm sorry, Instructor. C-could you h-hide me for a moment...?\"\nThe sight of her, trembling and pale like a drenched kitten as she made this pitiful request, made Eun Ryeo’s heart sink.\n\"Feel free to use this place.\"\nFor someone suffering from rejection disorder, this was a request she couldn't possibly refuse.\n\"Come sit here.\"\nEun Ryeo willingly stood up and offered her seat so Jeong Hyeon could sit where she had been.\n“You seem to have had quite a fright, and your body has grown cold. Warm yourself with some tea.”\nWithout even realizing it, Eun Ryeo's tone had also become gentle.\nJeong Hyeon, who had been showing signs of a panic attack, followed Eun Ryeo's instructions. And when Jeong Hyeon appeared somewhat calmer after drinking tea, Eun Ryeo belatedly asked.\n\"Is someone chasing you?\"\nAsking to be hidden must mean there was a pursuer. But what reason could a student have to be chased within the Hall?\nAt Instructor Eun Ryeo's question, Jeong Hyeon flinched.\n'Th-that's too embarrassing to say....'\nJeong Hyeon couldn't bring herself to say that she was being chased because of a certain… ample part of her anatomy.\n\"J-just... I'm b-being chased, Instructor.\"\n\"By whom?\"\nEun Ryeo asked, her voice uncharacteristically gentle compared to how she usually treated the students.\n\"B-Bang Mi-hwa and H-Ha Young. And J-Ju Seo-yeon are ch-chasing me, Instructor.\"\n\"Could you tell me the reason you're being chased?\"\nWhen Eun Ryeo asked gently again, Jeong Hyeon could only shake her head frantically in embarrassment.\nSeeing her absolute refusal to state the reason, Eun Ryeo was forced to deduce it herself.\n'Jeong Hyeon. Bang Mi-hwa. Ha Young. Ju Seo-yeon. Those names… they sound familiar when connected together…....'\nIndividually, the four women were unrelated, but strangely, all of their names were connected to one other name.\n'It's because of Disciple Il-mok!'\nThe moment that name came to mind, a whole story painted itself in Instructor Eun Ryeo’s head.\n‘I knew he would become a man of many sins, but to think he’d create a veritable scene of carnage!\n(TL Note: Shuraba!)",

    "content": "Chapter 113: Rampage (2)\n\"Haaaam.\"\nIl-mok let out a long, languid yawn and flopped onto his bed in the Black Dragon Pavilion. This, right here, was the important “business” he’d told Bang Mi-hwa about at dinner. True to the vow he’d made that morning during training, he was dedicating himself to being properly lazy.\n‘Clean body, full stomach. This is life. So cozy.’\nAs he rested his head on the pillow and surrendered to drowsiness, sleep quickly took hold of him.\nMeanwhile, beyond the window of Il-mok's room, atop a tree hidden by thick foliage...\n'Now he's openly sleeping without a care.'\nChu Il-hwan, who had been monitoring Il-mok's surroundings daily to catch any suspicious groups, wore a twisted expression.\nIt was barely the beginning of the Hour of the Dog (7-9 PM). Far too early to be going to bed.\nIn fact, no one else remained in the Black Dragon Pavilion except Il-mok. Everyone else was immersed in training.\nWhile others were dedicating themselves to cultivation at this hour, there he was, rolling around in bed like that.\nAs Chu Il-hwan stewed over what to do with that lazy good-for-nothing genius, his senses picked up a presence approaching the Black Dragon Pavilion.\nThe presence was so faint that even Chu Il-hwan, an instructor, didn't notice it at first.\nOnly when the presence reached the entrance to Il-mok's room did it trigger Chu Il-hwan's qi perception.\nThe moment the presence opened the door…\n‘Instructor Eun Ryeo!? What is she doing here!?’\nChu Il-hwan nearly lost his composure in that instant.\n'Could it be that Instructor Eun Ryeo is one of those rats targeting the Young Master?'\nIf so, then Instructor Eun Ryeo must have come to kill Il-mok while he slept alone.\n'Damn it!!'\nChu Il-hwan hastily gathered his internal energy, preparing to launch himself forward before she could strike.\n\"Disciple Il-mok!\"\nThat is, if Instructor Eun Ryeo hadn’t promptly called out Il-mok’s name the moment she opened the door.\n\"!?\"\nWhat kind of lunatic wakes up their target before trying to assassinate them? This wasn't Mak Ho-yeol or Dokgo Pae we were talking about.\n'Ugh...'\nChu Il-hwan, who had been about to leap into action, abruptly halted his movement and nearly tumbled off the branch he was standing on. To make matters worse, as if sensing something, Instructor Eun Ryeo’s gaze snapped toward the window.\n'Shit.'\nGritting his teeth, Chu Il-hwan hung from the tree branch with all four limbs, desperately suppressing his presence while making cat sounds with his mouth.\n\"Meow.\"\nThat awkward performance only deepened the suspicion on Instructor Eun Ryeo's face.\n\"!? I-Instructor Eun Ryeo?\"\nFortunately or unfortunately, Il-mok, who had been deep in sleep, opened his eyes. Thanks to this, Eun Ryeo's gaze, which had been directed toward the window, turned back to Il-mok.\nConfusion was written all over Il-mok's face.\n'Why is Instructor Eun Ryeo here?'\nWhat business could a female instructor possibly have in the room of a man who was sleeping alone?\n‘No way…!’\nNaturally, certain scenarios between teachers and students began to flash through Il-mok's mind. Meanwhile, Eun Ryeo looked at Il-mok with cold eyes and spoke.\n\"Disciple Il-mok.\"\n“Ahem. I must say, Instructor, I never took you for one to be so bold.”\n\"???\"\n\"But did you at least bathe before coming?\"\nFrom Il-mok's perspective, someone who suffered from hygiene obsessions, a proper bath was absolutely necessary before engaging in any certain... activities.\nAnd Chu Il-hwan, who was hanging from the tree with both arms and legs to avoid being detected by Eun Ryeo, turned pale with shock.\n‘What’s this about bathing? And what does he mean by ‘bold’? Don’t tell me…!?’\nWhile Chu Il-hwan was growing suspicious about the relationship between Il-mok and Eun Ryeo...\nEun Ryeo, still maintaining her cold expression, opened her mouth.\n“I fail to see why an instructor visiting a student would need to bathe.”\nHer frigid tone finally made Il-mok realize that he had misunderstood her.\nEmbarrassed, Il-mok cleared his throat and asked cautiously.\n\"Th-then what brings you here?\"\n“I came today in my capacity as an instructor to discuss a personal matter of yours, Disciple Il-mok.”\n\"...My personal life?\"\n\"That's right. As an instructor, I had no intention of meddling in a student’s private affairs. However, I've concluded that your case has gone too far.\"\nHearing her cold tone, Il-mok felt a twinge of guilt in his heart and subtly averted his gaze.\n'Did she find out I've been taking naps every day?'\nIl-mok assumed she had come to scold him for being too lazy, but Eun Ryeo's next words were far beyond his expectations.\n\"At the very least, shouldn't a man have some sense of responsibility toward women?\"\nThe reason Eun Ryeo had come to find Il-mok was to confront him about Jeong Hyeon, whom she was currently hiding in her quarters to protect her from Bang Mi-hwa, Ha Young, and Ju Seo-yeon.\n‘To gather a herd of women like that and then just abandon them irresponsibly. How can such an irresponsible man exist?'\nShe believed that Ju Seo-yeon and Bang Mi-hwa, who admired Il-mok, were jealous of Jeong Hyeon, who got along well with Il-mok, and were bullying her because of it. Ha Young was simply helping her friend Bang Mi-hwa.\nWhile the direct fault lay with Bang Mi-hwa, Ju Seo-yeon, and Ha Young, who had tried to bully her, the root of the problem was Il-mok’s failure to sort things out.\nThat was the conclusion Instructor Eun Ryeo had reached.\n\"...Excuse me?\"\nOf course, having just woken up to a lecture about responsibility, Il-mok was completely at a loss.\nMoreover...\n'Disciple Il-mok is an irresponsible man toward women?'\nThe mind of Chu Il-hwan, who was secretly eavesdropping, was also spinning into a complicated mess.\n'I knew it!! Their relationship must be deep enough for her to talk about responsibility! So he wasn’t just messing with the female disciples!!'\nAs Chu Il-hwan became convinced of the affair between the instructor and the student…\n“R-Responsibility? W-What are you talking about, Instructor?” Il-mok stammered, still unable to fully gather his wits.\n\"Exactly what I said. Did you think everything would work out fine after drawing in so many women like that?\"\n\"!?\"\nAfter briefly wondering what kind of insane talk this was...\nIl-mok was soon able to grasp the situation.\n\"Instructor, while I did bring Bang Mi-hwa into this, how can I be held responsible for one person liking another?\"\nShe must have come to confront him about the situation between Baek Cheon and Jeong Hyeon.\nJeong Hyeon had a one-sided crush on Baek Cheon. And Il-mok also knew that Jeong Hyeon and Instructor Eun Ryeo had a fairly close master-disciple relationship.\nIt stood to reason, then, that Instructor Eun Ryeo was at least vaguely aware of Jeong Hyeon’s crush.\nAnd into that dynamic, he had introduced Bang Mi-hwa, who got along perfectly with Baek Cheon.\nFrom Jeong Hyeon’s perspective, or that of her ally Instructor Eun Ryeo, it was an unwelcome development.\nHowever...\n“Disciple Il-mok, are you listening to yourself?”\nThat didn't mean she could come here and chew him out.\n'People should handle their own romantic affairs. Isn’t this overstepping a bit?\nHonestly, it was absurd. Most importantly...\n“I’ve already spoken with Bang Mi-hwa, Instructor. She said she has no ulterior motives, so everything now rests entirely on Jeong Hyeon.”\nHe had already done his part to sort things out. Therefore, there was absolutely no reason for him to be treated in this manner.\nAt Il-mok's confident response, Eun Ryeo couldn’t stop herself from pressing a hand to her forehead.\n\"How can you...\"\nThis is why men are hopeless.\nWhat woman in her right mind would openly declare, “Yes, I have ulterior motives toward you, and therefore I will bully Jeong Hyeon who gets in my way!'\nEun Ryeo started to feel deeply sorry for Jeong Hyeon, who had fallen for such a dense man.\n“You believed her just like that?”\n“Why would she have any reason to lie?”\n“Haaah…”\nEun Ryeo let out a deep sigh but didn't press the matter further.\nShe felt it would be rude to Jeong Hyeon to directly mention that she had been bullied by other women.\n“Try to be a little more responsible. There’s no telling what might happen while you’re away, Disciple Il-mok.”\nAfter leaving this final warning, Eun Ryeo left the room while still radiating a cold aura.\n\"...Why is she acting like this?\"\nEven after Eun Ryeo left, Il-mok couldn't understand her excessive meddling.\n\"While I was away? Don't tell me that bastard Baek Cheon did something weird while I wasn't there?\"\nIl-mok began to wonder if there had been some development between Baek Cheon and Bang Mi-hwa without his knowledge.\n“Damn it. I’ll have to subtly probe Baek Cheon about it when he gets back.”\nFeeling his head spinning, Il-mok lay back down on his bed with an expression that showed utter weariness.\nAnd outside the window, up in the tree…\n‘I see. So he seduced Instructor Eun Ryeo first! And then he brought in a whole group of women!’\n‘This is too much. He even drew in Disciple Bang Mi-hwa and then claims he has no reason to be responsible for her feelings.’\n‘…Disciple Bang Mi-hwa has no ulterior motives? And what’s this about everything being up to Disciple Jeong Hyeon?’\n'And why is Baek Cheon's name coming up?'\nChu Il-hwan, who had been eavesdropping on the entire conversation, found his mind becoming more jumbled as the dialogue between Il-mok and Eun Ryeo progressed.

Plus Instructor Eun Ryeo and Baek Cheon.\nThe relationships between these seven people swirled chaotically in Chu Il-hwan's mind.\nRight after Instructor Eun Ryeo left the room with her cold aura...\n\"Ugh.\"\nChu Il-hwan let out a soft groan and quickly assumed a cross-legged position to regulate his qi.\nThe shock of Eun Ryeo’s sudden appearance and the subsequent act of hastily stopping his surging energy had shaken up his meridians. It made his Demonic Art rear its ugly head again.\nThe strain of hiding his presence, combined with eavesdropping on that nonsensical conversation, had exacerbated his condition.\n—Promiscuous bastards deserve to die!\n—I, who have been alone my entire life, have the right to kill that trash!\n—Kill them!

    "content": "Chapter 114: Rampage (3)\nBOOM!\nI was exchanging blows with Chu Il-hwan at a terrifying speed. Though it was clearly my own body engaging in this fierce battle, I felt like a third-party observer watching the fight unfold.\nIt was an unfamiliar sensation.\n'Could my body move this fast?'\nEvery muscle and meridian in my body screamed in protest.\nBOOM!!\nBut it wasn't just from the impact of clashing with Chu Il-hwan's black lightning.\nThe Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, this other self within me, had pushed my physical output to the absolute limit my body could dish out.\nMy muscles, strained to their breaking point, were tearing with every passing moment.\nThe internal energy I'd drawn up until my dantian was completely empty surged through my entire meridians with such force that it ripped through my blood vessels as it went.\n—More! More! More!\n—Swing it more precisely!\nThough I was displaying swordsmanship stronger, faster, and more precise than ever before, the other self in my head continued its relentless clamoring.\nBut even with my body surrendered to the rampage of Demonic Art, the difference in skill was undeniable.\nBOOM!!\nThe moment my sword blocked Chu Il-hwan’s twin palms wreathed in black lightning—\nCrack!\nI was sent flying back into the corridor of the Hall of the Demonic Way by the tremendous impact, smashing through a door as I flew.\nThud!\nEven so, my body moved with an uncanny grace and quickly regained its balance.\n\"Kehehehe!! Die!!\"\nBut Chu Il-hwan, whose reason was gone, showed no intention of slowing his assault. He charged again, alternating his twin palm strikes at incredible speed.\nIt was a strange feeling.\nWhile the rampaging Chu Il-hwan had completely lost his mind and was thrashing about wildly—\n\"Huu.\"\nMy body, under the control of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, was eerily calm.\nIf someone else were watching, it would appear as though I was maintaining my reason rather than being consumed by the Demonic Art.\n—Why are you swinging the sword so simply?\nBefore I knew it, my sword was weaving together the various principles contained within the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\nTo match the speed of Chu Il-hwan's twin palms, I swung my right hand holding the sword according to the principles of Soul-Cutting Flash (斷魂一閃), an art dedicated to extreme speed.\nAs the Demonic Art demanded movements far more extreme than usual, my muscles screamed in agony.\nAnd absurdly, the Sword Qi formed on the blade as my body executed the Soul-Cutting Flash created a repelling force according to the principles of the Soul-Repelling Sword.\nBOOM!\nThe fiercer Chu Il-hwan's assault became, the more complex and miraculous the swordsmanship of my other self displayed. It was impossible to tell whether this was a life-and-death battle or an educational training.\nBut my body was still far from being able to fully execute the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's demands, and I was repeatedly pushed back by Chu Il-hwan's assault.\n“Eheheheheet!”\nWith a bizarre laugh, Chu Il-hwan unleashed another flurry of attacks, and my body was once again sent flying backward.\nCrash!\nPiercing through the window of the Hall of the Demonic Way, my eyes caught sight of the full moon hanging in the black sky.\n\"Ehehehehe!!\"\nAnd Chu Il-hwan, following me through the shattered window, appeared blocking that full moon.\nFloating in mid-air, Chu Il-hwan clapped his twin palms together and the black lightning arced between them rapidly growing in size.\nHe was preparing for a lethal technique seeing my body was suspended mid-air.\nNaturally, the small sliver of reason that had lost most of its territory to the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword couldn't help but feel a sense of foreboding.\n‘Crazy bastard. He’s really trying to kill me.’\nCome to think of it, that madman had been screaming for me to die for a while now.\n'Wasn't he trying to sexually assault me...?'\nOnly now did I realize Chu Il-hwan's purpose was different, but that wasn’t important right now.\n\"Die!!\"\nFinally, Chu Il-hwan thrust his twin palms downward, shooting a massive Black Lightning bolt at me.\nWhile my instincts rang alarm bells about this life-threatening crisis—\n\"Seuup.\"\nMy body took a deep breath and simultaneously began circulating my remaining internal energy at tremendous speed.\n'This is the Soul-Guiding Sword, and this is Soul Jade Core. Wow, he even mixed in a secret technique?\nInside my body, a complex and rapid flow of internal energy was taking place, but strangely, my body moved with perfect calmness.\nAs I fell toward the ground, I held my sword out in front of me, waiting for the black lightning to reach me.\nThe moment the sword tip made contact with the black lightning, a sword barrier had somehow formed to envelop the lightning.\nThe barrier, moving with the gentle swing of my sword, guided the black lightning, redirecting it to the right.\nBut that was only the surface.\nMy sword arm screamed as if it were about to snap at any moment.\nDespite deploying the principle of redirection to its limit, the rebound force that couldn't be completely neutralized sent my body flying to the left.\nBOOM!!\nOnly after my body crashed into the ground and rolled several times like a bouncing ball could all the impact be dispersed and I came to a stop.\n\"Cough....\"\nA torrent of black blood erupted from my mouth.\nMy body, declaring it could no longer move, began forcibly shutting down my consciousness.\nIn my fading consciousness, I could vaguely see instructors rushing toward me.\n\"Young Master Il-mok!!\"\n\"Instructor Chu! Get a grip!!\"\nAt their shouts, somehow a bitter smile appeared on my lips rather than a sigh of relief.\nIt wasn't because I didn't trust them.\n'This time, I’m definitely fucked up.'\nEven if I survived this, I had a feeling I’d be plagued by a serious case of enlightenment and its side effects for a long time to come.\n\"Oh no....\"\nEun Ryeo, the first to arrive on the scene, could hardly hide her troubled expression.\nShe had been able to arrive first because she had just finished a talk with Il-mok at the Black Dragon Pavilion.\nStepping between Il-mok and Instructor Chu Il-hwan, she met his eyes and knew instantly.\n'He's completely lost his reason.'\nAs if to prove her right, Chu Il-hwan charged at her while radiating killing intent.\n“You want to die too, you bitch!!”\nEun-ryeo gracefully drew her thin sword and blocked Chu Il-hwan's Black Thunder Demonic Palm.\n\"Kuk....\"\nWith each exchange, she was gradually pushed back.\nNot only because Chu Il-hwan was acknowledged as the Head Instructor, the most skilled among them all, but he was also in a state of rampage.\nHe is not an opponent she could handle alone, especially while protecting Il-mok behind her.\nBut she wasn’t worried. She knew the other instructors were on their way.\n\"I'll join you!\"\nWith that shout, Instructor Cheok Il-so, in charge of external martial arts training, threw himself forward with his spear.\nAs if he had anticipated it, Chu Il-hwan met the spearhead with his left palm.\nZzzzzzt!\nWhile Chu Il-hwan's black lightning and Cheok Il-so's spear clashed—\nSwish!\nInstructor Eun Ryeo's thin sword whipped through the air flexibly, flying toward Chu Il-hwan at a strange angle.\nChu Il-hwan responded in a bizarre fashion.\nHe poured more internal energy into his left palm, which was clashing with Cheok Il-so's spear.\nBang!!\nInstead, he deployed his footwork backward, using the rebound force from clashing with the spear to retreat and avoid Eun Ryeo's thin sword.\nFor a short while after, Eun Ryeo, Cheok Il-so, and Chu Il-hwan continued their clash.\nSoon, the area around them was filled with students, instructors, and teaching assistants who had been drawn by the commotion.\n\"Tch.\"\nThe moment Vice Hall Master Yu Geuk clicked his tongue with cold eyes and drew his blade to step forward—\n\"Everyone, stand back.\"\nThe weighty words of the Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi pressed down on the entire area.\nVice Hall Master Yu Geuk sheathed his blade and stepped back, and those around naturally gave them space.\nAnd Eun Ryeo and Cheok Il-so, who had been confronting Chu Il-hwan—\nBang!\nUsed the rebound force from clashing with Chu Il-hwan's black lightning to retreat.\nYeom Ga-hwi stepped forward and faced Chu Il-hwan while sighing inwardly.\n'He's completely lost his reason.'\nThe way Chu Il-hwan was radiating such killing intent even toward the Hall Master left no room for doubt.\n\"Krahaat!!\"\nWith a strange battle cry, Chu Il-hwan charged and unleashed torrents of black lightning.\nYeom Ga-hwi stood his ground, taking the stance of a straight punch and drawing a deep breath.\nCrimson energy shimmered around Yeom Ga-hwi's body, taking on the form of a three-headed and six-armed phantom.\nFwip!\nAnd in the next moment, Yeom Ga-hwi’s right fist was already launched. It was as if reality had glitched and the moveset of the punch was skipped.\nFurthermore—\nSix crimson fist energies were carving different trajectories through the air.\nBOOM!\nA series of explosive sounds with subtle time differences exploded at the torrents of black lightning, completely annihilating it.\nFwip!\nAnd in the next instant, Yeom Ga-hwi was right in front of Chu Il-hwan.\nTHWACK\nWith a sound like the beating of a drum, Chu Il-hwan's body flew backward after being struck in the abdomen.\n\"Kraaaak!\"\nChu Il-hwan tumbled across the ground several times and was about to get up when Yeom Ga-hwi, who had closed the distance in an instant, struck a series of Chu Il-hwan’s pressure points rapidly.\nAfter subduing Chu Il-hwan, Yeom Ga-hwi turned his head to look at Eun Ryeo.\n\"What is Disciple Il-mok's condition?\"\n“His external injuries are not severe, but his internal injuries are serious. If he is left as he is, he will likely suffer from major aftereffects.”\n\"...Have him transported immediately to the medical wing at the main headquarters.\"\n“I will obey your command!”\nInstructor Eun Ryeo carried Il-mok and left the Hall of the Demonic Way using her lightness skill.\nHaving given his orders, Yeom Ga-hwi looked down at the unconscious Chu Il-hwan on the ground with a complicated expression.\nA vast open space.\nThere, I was swinging my sword relentlessly.\n\"Huu.\"\nSometimes, I swung it alone into the empty air.\n\"Kahahaha!\"\nSometimes my Eldest Brother appeared and swung his sword like a madman. Other times, my Third Brother would show up and try to assassinate me.\nAfter going through near-death crises and refining my swordsmanship again, Master would appear, and Jin Hayeon would appear too.\nEveryone I had ever crossed swords with appeared in turn to attack me.\nSwish.\nHow could I draw a more perfect sword path? How could I complete the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword?\nHow long had I been swinging my sword, absorbed only in swinging my sword?\nAfter fighting life-and-death battles and refining my sword techniques alone dozens of times—\nA question belatedly occurred to me.\n'How am I still able to swing my sword?'\nI couldn't remember exactly, but I had been swinging my sword for quite some time.\nBy now, my internal energy should have been completely exhausted, and my muscles should have been so strained that I couldn't move a finger.\nOf course, even at this moment, my muscles were screaming constantly, and my meridians were crying out in agony.\nSwish!\nBut despite that, my sword was still moving.\nYes. Just like when Instructor Chu Il-hwan attacked me.\n'Attack?'\nOne question led to another. Had I been attacked?\n\"Ehihihihi! I'll kill you!\"\nJust then, Chu Il-hwan charged from the front, scattering black lightning wildly.\nWhy was it? That scene looked to me like something that had already happened and was repeating itself.\nAnd I, as if repeating what had happened before, began to counter his moves as if someone were controlling me with strings.\nAfter exchanging a series of choreographed blows with Chu Il-hwan…\nSoon, Chu Il-hwan's form scattered like a mirage.\nSssshhh.\nIce Qi (寒氣) covered the area, and Jin Hayeon's figure began to be drawn in the air.\nAfter exchanging moves with Jin Hayeon, who appeared like a mirage—\nOnly then could I realize the current situation.\n'It's a dream. Or am I suffering from Qi Deviation?’\nI sighed and ignored Jin Hayeon's assault, letting my sword droop.\nNo, I tried to let it droop. Read complete versıon only at novel_fіre.net\n'This damn Demonic Art.'\nAs if telling me not to stop practicing swordsmanship, my body kept trying to move on its own.\nBut now that I knew this was a dream, I had no intention of being dragged around as it pleased.\nHalt.\nThe moment I forced my sword to a stop, Jin Hayeon’s twin palms flew toward my chest. As if to counter the attack, my sword arm tried to move.\nFwip.\nBut I moved my left hand, grabbing my sword-wielding right hand and holding it still.\nTHWACK!\nRight after that, Jin Hayeon's twin palms finally struck my chest.\nCold energy enveloped my entire body, causing me to shiver.\nEven then, my body tried to rebel on its own, adamantly trying to swing the sword again.\n“Yeah, I know my realm is still lacking.”\nI gritted my teeth and fought back the Demonic Art.\n\"But what are you going to do about it? What can you do, Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword? Other than screaming in my head, what can you do, you pathetic little piece of shit side effect!”",

    "content": "Chapter 115: Reform (1)\nI gritted my teeth and endured the pain. In my mental world, I was repeatedly struck by Jin Hayeon’s White Hand Demonic Art.\nAs the cold qi seeped into my entire body, the seizure caused by the rampaging demonic energy began to subside.\n\"Huff... Whew.\"\nI took a deep breath, and the moment I closed my eyes and opened them again…\nFlicker.\nInstead of the empty wasteland, I saw a strangely familiar ceiling.\nAnd not only that—\nTap, tap, tap!\nJin Hayeon was there, tapping my body with hands infused with the White Hand Demonic Art.\n\"...Am I still dreaming?\"\nAs I muttered to myself without thinking, Jin Hayeon, who had been channeling her Demonic Art with beads of sweat on her forehead, turned her gaze toward me.\n\"!!!\"\nAn extremely rare emotion—relief—flickered in Jin Hayeon's eyes before disappearing.\n\"Damn. I'm still dreaming.\"\nThere was no way Jin Hayeon would ever make a face like that. Besides, why would she, who should be at the main headquarters, even be here?\nThen, as if what I had seen was an illusion, Jin Hayeon returned to her usual indifferent expression and spoke.\n\"What nonsense are you spouting, Young Master? This is the medical hall. Doesn’t it look familiar to you?\"\nShe was right, the ceiling was familiar.\nThis was the place I'd been dragged to after being attacked by Eldest Brother, and then again after being attacked by Jang Hwi.\n“Then why are you hitting my body this whole time?”\n“Your body kept heating up, Young Master. I was lowering it by using the usual massage.”\nOnly after hearing her answer could I somewhat piece things together.\n‘So my physical condition in reality is also connected to the mental world?’\nThe rampage of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword had pushed my meridians and muscles to their limits, which must be why my entire body had been aching in my mental world as well.\nMoreover, Jin Hayeon's appearance at the end might have been because she was actually treating me in reality.\nNo, maybe every time Jin Hayeon appeared—even if the other enemies were just phantoms—I had actually been receiving her treatment.\n\"Ugh.\"\nWas it because I was now aware of my body’s poor condition? When I tried to move even slightly, my entire body screamed as if I were dying.\n\"Neither your muscles nor meridians are in good condition, Young Master. You absolutely must rest first. Ah, if your side effects flare up and you feel the urge to swing your sword, please let me know.\"\n\"??? You'll let me swing it?\"\n“I will do as I did last time.”\n\"Last time...?\"\nNaturally, I recalled the incident when Jang Hwi attacked me.\nThe enlightenment I gained about sword energy had come at the price of worsening the side effects.\nEvery time I woke up, Jin Hayeon would press my pressure points to put me back to sleep.\n\"Ahem. The side effects have subsided a bit now, so don't worry.\"\nRemembering how awful it felt to be forcibly put to sleep, I quickly refused.\n\"Then I'll finish the treatment first.\"\nEven as she spoke, Jin Hayeon’s hands were still busily moving, massaging various parts of my body.\n\"Your skills seem to have improved quite a bit.\"\nWhen Jin Hayeon first began attending to me, she couldn't speak while performing the treatment.\nShe had to focus entirely on White Hand Demonic Art and the treatment, or it would be dangerous.\nBut now, she was doing it while conversing as if it were nothing.\nEven after hearing my praise, Jin Hayeon simply maintained her indifferent expression, giving no response and focusing only on the pressure point treatment.\n'Ahh... In my mental world, I was shivering from the cold, but this actually feels pretty refreshing.’\nAs the overloaded muscles from the rampage cooled down, a strange sense of relief washed over me.\nI was enjoying the cool treatment for a short while when—\nCreak .\nThe sound of a door softly opening was followed by someone entering the room.\n“Hoh. You’re awake, Deputy Master.”\nIt was a familiar voice.\n“It’s been a while, Elder Demonic Physician. I apologize for not being able to show my respects, given my condition.”\n\"Hahaha. If you had tried to get up, I would have been angry instead.\"\n“So, what brings the esteemed Hall Master of the Pure Mind Hall here?”\n\"Medical skills also rust if one neglects training. Even now that I've moved to the Pure Mind Hall, I still personally handle serious patients from time to time.\"\nI asked with a sullen tone.\n\"...Is my condition serious enough to warrant your personal attention, Elder?”\n\"It was quite serious when you first arrived. But we’ve put out the urgent fires, so there’s no need to worry. You’ll need to rest for a while, but there shouldn’t be any major problems. I’m just here to finish up what I started.”\nWith that, the Demonic Physician looked back and forth between me and Jin Hayeon, then nodded.\n\"For now, thanks to Miss Jin, the heat in your muscles has subsided somewhat, so we need to revitalize the energy in your blood vessels.\"\nAs soon as he finished speaking, Jin Hayeon, having completed her treatment, moved aside, and the Demonic Physician took her place beside me.\nHe then took out a rolled cloth from the needle case he had brought, unfolded it, and extracted the needles wrapped within.\n\"Gulp.\"\nAs I turned my head slightly to watch him, the sound of me swallowing dryly echoed in the room.\n“Uh… Elder Demonic Physician?”\n\"What is it?\"\n“You are not going to stick that needle directly into my pressure points, are you?”\n\"Why ask a pointless question?\"\n\"...Without even disinfecting them?\"\nMy pupils began trembling uncontrollably.\nThe side effects of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword that I had barely managed to calm were about to burst forth along with my hygiene obsession.\n'Damn. Has my level increased to this extent?' The source of thɪs content is nοvelfire.net\nMy hygiene obsession had definitely gotten worse.\nIn the past, I had considered washing with water and rubbing with salt to be clean enough, but now, that level was no longer satisfactory.\n‘Damn you, modern knowledge.'\nIf I had known nothing, I would have just accepted the treatment. But for me, someone who understood the concept of germs and disinfection, this was completely unacceptable.\nHearing my question, the Demonic Physician tilted his head.\n“Hahaha. Disinfection? What are you talking about, Deputy Master? Can’t you see? These are silver needles. If there were any poison, they would change color. There’s no need to worry.”\nI almost spat out a curse at this quack doctor's nonsense.\n'Damn it. What good is silver if it's not properly maintained?!'\nI wasn’t a science major, so I couldn’t be sure, but it seemed unlikely that silver was completely free from bacteria and viruses.\n“Alcohol! Bring me alcohol! The strongest you have!”\nAt my urgent cry, the quack doctor who had been hesitating burst into laughter.\n“Hahaha. Don’t worry. It won’t hurt that much. Ah, if you really need anesthesia, would you like a little bit of ‘that’ instead?\"\nThis crazy quack thought I was asking for strong liquor as an anesthetic. And what the hell was ‘that’ supposed to be?\n“By ‘that,’ you don’t mean… drugs, do you?”\n\"Didn't you say so yourself, Deputy Master? It was acceptable to use on patients who couldn’t bear extreme pain. If you’re really afraid it will hurt, I can give you a little.”\n\".......\"\nWas this quack trying to get someone killed?\nAs my cursed other self was already starting to rear its ugly head and make a fuss, listening to this quack's nonsense on top of it gave me a headache.\n\"Sigh. Just bring me the liquor for now. I’ll explain the reason later.”\nThe Demonic Physician put down his needles and left with a mischievous smile.\n\"Hehehe. I suppose even the Deputy Master can't be as formidable as Guan Yu. Making such a fuss like this.\"\nIgnoring the quack's nonsense, I waited for a moment.\n\"Whew. I never thought I'd be giving this to the Deputy Master first.\"\nThe Demonic Physician returned with a somewhat regretful expression. He was carefully holding what appeared to be an old bottle of liquor.\n“Well, since we’re opening it anyway, I might as well drink the rest after the treatment is done. Hehehe.”\nTrue to being a quack doctor, he seemed to love his alcohol.\nAs he broke the seal on the bottle, an intense alcoholic aroma wafted over.\n\"Mmm~\"\nThe way he stuck his nose in and enjoyed the scent was the very picture of a drunkard.\nAfter enjoying the aroma to his heart’s content, the drunkard quack poured some of the liquor into a cup he’d brought and offered it to me.\n\"I didn't ask for it so I could drink it.\"\n\"Then shall I drink it?\"\nSeeing him about to bring the cup to his own lips, I quickly shouted, “The needle! Put the needle in the cup!”\nJust smelling the liquor was enough to make my head spin from its strength. He was going to drink that and then insert some needles into my body?\nAt my urgent cry to stop the Demonic Physician, he glared at me fiercely.\n\"Why put needles in perfectly good liquor? Are you suspecting me right now?\"\nI took a moment to process his nonsense before I belatedly understood. “Ahem. I wasn’t suspecting that the liquor was poisoned. As I said before, it’s to disinfect the needle.”\nAt my explanation, the Demonic Physician looked at me with narrowed eyes and asked, “You’ve been going on about disinfection. What does alcohol have to do with disinfection?”\nI felt relieved inside at that question.\nTrying to explain viruses and bacteria to someone from this era would be pointless. While he was gone fetching the liquor, I had already formulated a story to persuade him.\n“Elder Demonic Physician, do you remember the story of how I was a waiter in an inn before I became my Master’s disciple?”\n“Of course. Didn’t you say that the owner of that inn also taught you that Black Bean Tea or whatever it was?”\n\"Yes. He was both an inn owner and a cook. So he regularly prepared food at the inn, and one day he had this question: Why does food spoil faster on hot summer days?\"\nThe Demonic Physician as if telling me to continue.\n“And there was one more question. Even when it wasn’t summer, customers would sometimes get a stomachache after eating the food he served. As Uncle Tae-hyun reviewed his daily cooking process, he realized it happened more often with a specific dish, and especially frequently in the summer.”\n\"Hmm. So what was the cause?\"\n\"According to Uncle Tae-hyun, after trying a few changes to the cooking process, he found that it often happened when he used the same knife that had cut other meat to cut more meat or vegetables, especially in summer.\"\n\"Hmm. Come to think of it, wounds from dirty blades that had already cut many people on battlefields often don't heal easily and tend to fester or rot.\"\nAs expected of a physician, he was drawing a parallel to a patient-related example.\n\"Exactly. So, Uncle Tae-hyun initially started washing his knife with water every time he cut meat before continuing with preparation. But even then, some customers would still get stomachaches in the summer. As he pondered what to do, a thought suddenly occurred to him.”\n\"What kind of thought?\"\nThe Demonic Physician, who had initially seemed indifferent, was now showing a flicker of interest.\n“Just as they say that stagnant water rots, if water is left to sit in a bottle or dish, it spoils. But what about liquor? If properly sealed, doesn't older liquor actually become more valuable? So, Uncle Tae-hyun tried washing off blood with water after cutting meat, then wiping the surface once with strong liquor before handling the food.\"\n“Hoh. And what was the result?”\n\"From then on, the number of customers with stomachaches decreased noticeably. However, questions still remained. Why is liquor fine while water isn't? And why did even liquor spoil if it wasn't sealed properly?”\nThough expressed through food ingredients, the Demonic Physician seemed to sense that this story was also related to medicine, his eyes shining with curiosity as he looked at me, as if urging me to quickly reveal the answer.\n\"Uncle Tae-hyun's theory was simple. Liquor makes people feel good in small amounts, but it's definitely poisonous if consumed in large quantities. Water, on the other hand, is essential for all living things, including humans, to survive. Isn't that right?\"\n\"That's correct.\"\n\"From this, Uncle Tae-hyun's theory was this: Perhaps there exist extremely tiny living creatures that our eyes cannot see, and among them are disease-causing germs (細菌).\"\n\"Germs?\"\n“That’s the name Uncle Tae-hyun coined. In stagnant water, they continuously drink that water and multiply, becoming toxic to humans, but liquor is also toxic to these germs, so they die. Since they're living creatures so small as to be invisible, even a tiny amount of liquor would kill them. However, if liquor isn't properly sealed, new germs would continuously enter through the air, eventually causing it to spoil.\"\nI had no way of knowing if this was scientifically accurate. I hadn't majored in biology, and I wasn't even from a scientific background.\nBut that wasn't my concern.\nThe only thing that mattered right now was this: was it a plausible story for someone from this era?\n\"Oh. Germs, you say. An interesting theory indeed. So do these germs really exist?\"\nAnd apparently, my fabricated story had worked.\n\"As you know, Uncle Tae-hyun was a cook and inn owner, not a physician. He didn't have the resources to experiment and verify if his theory was correct. But circumstantially, isn't it worth considering?\"\n“Hahaha. Though his path differed from our Cult’s, the ancient sage called Confucius once said, 'When three people walk together, there must be one who can be my teacher' (三人行 必有我師). To think this old physician would have something to learn from a cook. Hahaha.”\nWith a satisfied expression, the Demonic Physician laughed heartily and began disinfecting by dipping his silver needles into the cup of strong liquor.\nHe then dabbed a bit of the liquor on the spot where he was going to insert the needle. As it evaporated, I felt the familiar cool sensation of rubbing alcohol.\n'Phew.'\nFeeling that coolness, my hygiene obsession subsided and my mind became somewhat calmer.\nThen Ma-ui, who had been applying the liquor, smiled contentedly and said.\nJust then, the Demonic Physician, who was applying the liquor, said with a fond smile, “It’s truly a shame about that innkeeper, Tae-hyun. If he were alive and had come to the Cult with you, Deputy Master, I’m sure he would have accomplished great things. Hahaha.”\n“Y-Yes, I think so too. Ha. Hahaha.”\nFirst Black Bean Tea, now germs and disinfection.\nMaybe Uncle Tae-hyun’s name would leave a significant mark in the historical records of the Demonic Cult.\n‘W-Would he be happy?’\nI felt a wave of guilt, knowing that because of me, his name was about to be recorded in the history of a cult.",

    "content": "Chapter 116: Reform (2)\nAfter sterilizing the silver needles with strong liquor and applying the liquor to disinfect the areas where the needles would be inserted, the treatment for the meridians continued.\nWhen all the treatment was finished, the Demonic Physician gazed at the liquor bottle with a face full of regret and remarked, “Hmm. This liquor is better off for experiments, just as the Deputy Master mentioned, rather than for drinking.”\nBut soon his expression changed, and he exclaimed as if struck by a revolutionary idea. “Ah! I’ve got it! If these ‘germs’ you speak of truly exist, then all we need is something that can kill them. How about using poison instead of strong liquor?\"\n\".......\" Dıscover more novels at novęlfire.net\nHas this old geezer lost his goddamn mind?\n\"Poison is harmful to humans regardless of the dosage. So liquor is still the best option. How about this? We could adopt the distillation method, but instead of caring about the taste, we focus solely on increasing the alcohol concentration to create medical-grade alcohol.\"\n“Hmm. Hearing you put it that way, it does make sense.”\nI let out a silent sigh of relief when the Demonic Physician nodded his head.\nIf I’d just let him be, the world would have seen the birth of a mad doctor who went around poking people with poison-tipped needles.\nThe conversation about sterilizing alcohol must have triggered something, because my hygiene-obsessed brain forced a strange request out of my mouth.\n“Ah, one more thing, Elder Demonic Physician. If you do manage to create that medicinal alcohol, could you spare a bit for me?”\n\"Hmm? Are you also interested in the art of acupuncture, Deputy Master?\"\n\"I just thought I'd carry it around to wash my hands.\"\nWhen it comes to hygiene, there's nothing quite like hand sanitizer.\n“Wash your hands? Why…?”\nThe quack physician looked at me as if I were some kind of freak, but I couldn’t be bothered to care.\n'Hmm. Come to think of it, medical alcohol and anesthetic drugs... Somehow, I have a feeling that surgeries will become popular in the Demonic Cult.'\nThe Cult was already teeming with lunatics whose daily routine consisted of grabbing a weapon and looking for a fight. Getting stabbed was, quite literally, an everyday occurrence.\nWith the problems of pain and infection on the verge of being solved, we could be looking at a significant leap in medical science.\n'I have to make sure I never, ever get injured.’\nThat was a problem for another day. Right now, I have an ominous feeling we are about to enter an era of wildly unhinged medical experimentation.\nAs I shivered at the unwelcome thought, a roar echoed from outside the infirmary.\n\"We greet the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons!\"\n\"The Heavenly Demon has arrived! Ten thousand demons bow!\"\nLooks like the news of my awakening had reached Master's ears.\nA moment later, the doors swung open and Master made his entrance. Strangely enough, the Hall Master of the Demonic Way, Yeom Ga-hwi, was also by his side.\nOne day before Il-mok awakened.\n\"Kugh.\"\nChu Il-hwan, who had gone berserk, opened his eyes with a groan.\nThe first thing that came to Chu Il-hwan's mind was confusion.\nAnd rightly so, because his arms and legs were bound to a chair, and his internal energy was also sealed.\nAs his vision cleared, he saw Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi and Vice Hall Master Yu Geuk seated before him with their eyes fixed on him.\nFeeling the tension in the air, Chu Il-hwan finally pieced together what had happened.\n'...Right. I fell into Qi Deviation.'\nHe didn't remember everything, but he vaguely recalled what he had done during his rampage.\nWhile Chu Il-hwan was piecing together the situation, the stone-faced Yu Geuk opened his mouth.\n\"Instructor Chu.\"\n\"...Yes, Vice Hall Master.\"\n\"What is your reason for attacking Disciple Il-mok?\"\n\"...I succumbed to Qi Deviation. The side effects of the Black Thunder Demonic Palm overwhelmed me.”\nYu Geuk nodded once and opened his mouth again.\n\"Then tell me this. Why were you loitering around the Black Dragon Hall when you fell into Qi Deviation?”\nChu Il-hwan vividly remembered the events leading up to his collapse.\n\".......\"\nHowever, Chu Il-hwan couldn't bring himself to answer.\nIt wasn’t that he was embarrassed to bring up the sordid affair involving six disciples and Instructor Eun Ryeo in a serious setting. No, it was because the moment he did, the next question would be why he was eavesdropping on them in the first place.\nSince he had monitored Il-mok's surroundings on Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi's orders, spilling that now would drag the Head into this mess.\n“I was merely passing by the area when the heart demon suddenly took hold of me.\"\nYu Geuk maintained his indifferent face at this answer. He simply nodded.\n“I see. So you were just coincidentally passing by the Black Dragon Hall when, out of nowhere and for no reason, your heart demon launched its attack. And as it happens Disciple Il-mok just happened to be there alone, you attacked him. Is that it?”\n\"...That's correct.\"\nChu Il-hwan had to fight the urge to grind his teeth. Even to his own ears, the excuse sounded pathetic.\nAs if losing his interest in Chu Il-hwan, Yu Geuk turned his head with a cold face and looked at Yeom Ga-hwi.\n\"Hall Master.\"\n\"Speak, Vice Hall Master.\"\n“This is a grave matter. While students getting injured at the Hall of the Demonic Way is a normal occurrence, the magnitude of this matter is different. Injuries during education or examinations would be one thing. Still, a case where an instructor harmed a student during peacetime is unprecedented in history since the Heavenly Demon reformed the Demonic Way.\"\n“I am aware.\"\nWhen Yeom Ga-hwi nodded with a serious expression, Yu Geuk spoke again.\n“Most importantly, the victim was Young Master Il-mok. While it’s true that all cadets are treated as equals within these walls, this case is different. Moreover, he even dares to fabricate false testimony like that… one cannot help but question his true motives.”\n\"I know.\"\nHearing Yeom Ga-hwi’s clipped response, Yu Geuk let out a quiet, cold sigh.\n\"I know that the Hall Master cherishes Instructor Chu. However, since you are always fair and just, Hall Master, I trust that you will handle this matter reasonably as well.\"\n\"Don't worry, Vice Hall Master.\"\nWith that, Yeom Ga-hwi closed his eyes for a moment, then looked at Yu Geuk.\n\"I'd like to have a conversation with Instructor Chu for a moment, so could you leave us alone?\"\nA crushing weight settled over the room as Yeom Ga-hwi fought to contain the roiling energy of his Asura Blood Fist. Yet, Yu Geuk didn't so much as flinch.\n\"I'll trust you, Hall Master.\"\nYu Geuk, who had warned him not to be buried in personal feelings, got up and left the room.\n\"Phew.\"\nOnce he was gone, Yeom Ga-hwi let out a sigh filled with complex emotions and rubbed his eyes once with his callused hands.\nStill bound to the chair, Chu Il-hwan couldn’t bear to watch and hung his head in shame. But a moment later, raised his name when Yeom Ga-whi called his name after composing himself.\n\"Instructor Chu.\"\n\"...Yes, Hall Master.\"\n“Tell me honestly. Were you the mole all along?”\nYeom Ga-hwi was torn on this matter.\nAlthough he had directly seen Chu Il-hwan go berserk, the fact that Chu Il-hwan had gone berserk itself was strange.\n'How could Instructor Chu, a man who was already starting to transcend the stage of Extremity, be consumed by the side effect of his Demonic Art and lose his reason completely?'\nThere are times when side effects flare up. But to lose his mind completely all of a sudden while just monitoring a student?\nEven Yeom Ga-hwi couldn’t help but suspect that Chu Il-hwan had used the side effect as a pretext to kill Il-mok.\nChu Il-hwan shook his head with a pale face.\n\"Absolutely not, Hall Master. Punish me for my incompetence, and I will gladly accept it. However, I absolutely did not deceive or betray you, Hall Master.\"\n“Then why did you lose control? As the Vice Hall Master said, attacking a cadet like that is not a normal occurrence.”\n\".......\"\nChu Il-hwan hesitated for a moment.\nWhat was the point of bringing up that bizarre story he’d overheard in this situation?\n'This happened because my own discipline was lacking in the first place.’\nFalling into Qi Deviation because he overheard some raunchy gossip and got spooked by an instructor’s sudden appearance… it was all just a pathetic excuse.\nHowever.\nThrough the fog of memory from after he went berserk, there was one thing Chu Il-hwan remembered.\n“It is true that my heart demon struck while I was observing Cadet Il-mok on your orders. But I immediately began meditating to suppress it.”\n\"But?\"\n“Just as I was about to get it under control, I had a vague feeling of something external invading my body. After that, the rampage clouds my memory. It’s… hard to say more with any certainty.”\n“…Someone approached you during your Qi Deviation and aggravated your Demonic Art?”\n\"...That's correct.\"\nWhile Chu Il-hwan hung his head low in his own incompetence, Yeom Ga-hwi looked at Chu Il-hwan's head with a face that clearly showed his complex feelings.\n'Is he telling the truth? Or is this just another lie?\nYeom Ga-hwi couldn’t decide. Ironically, it was his own unbending character that paralyzed him.\nIf he chose to trust Chu Il-hwan, it would be simple. He would accept his story—that someone had targeted Chu Il-hwan.\nHowever, Yeom Ga-hwi couldn't trust himself rather than Chu Il-hwan.\n'Am I being blinded by sentiment?\nIf it had been anyone else, he would have condemned them as the culprit without a second thought. But because it was Chu Il-hwan, he was agonizing over the possibility of his innocence. And that very hesitation felt like a betrayal of his principles, a surrender to personal feelings.\nAfter wrestling with himself for a long time, he came to a conclusion.\n'If personal emotions blind me, I just need to leave the judgment to someone else.'\nIf Yeom Ga-hwi himself were the supreme leader, he would have to make the decision himself, but in this matter, he wasn't the final decision-maker from the beginning.\n\"I'll postpone the judgment on you for now. However, I cannot release those bonds, so endure it.\"\n\"...I'm sorry, Hall Master.\"\nYeom Ga-hwi gave the shamed man one last look and left.\nHe told Vice Hall Master Yu Geuk who was waiting outside the building, \"Since this matter is also related to Young Master Il-mok, I'll report directly to the Heavenly Demon and receive his judgment. I plan to report exactly what happened, you have my word.”\n\"...I will follow the Hall Master's will.\"\nAnd the next day.\nYeom Ga-hwi left the Hall of the Demonic Way and headed to the Heavenly Demon Palace at the main headquarters.\nYeom Ga-hwi reported the entire situation of the Il-mok attack incident exactly as it was.\nHe reported his deep suspicions about Chu Il-hwan, but he also relayed Chu Il-hwan’s defense that he had been influenced by an unknown party.\nSince it was the Heavenly Demon who had originally ordered him to catch the mole, there was no need to hide that he had ordered Chu Il-hwan to monitor Il-mok.\nOf course, if the Heavenly Demon judged Chu Il-hwan as the culprit, Yeom Ga-hwi, who had appointed him as the monitor, would also be unable to escape punishment.\nHowever, even knowing this fact, Yeom Ga-hwi still reported everything. He believed that if Chu Il-hwan was guilty, he who had trusted him should also gladly accept punishment.\nSuch was Yeom Ga-hwi, an upright man who showed no compromise even to himself.\nAfter hearing all of Yeom Ga-hwi's explanation, the Heavenly Demon stroked his beard and seemed to ponder for a moment, then brought up an unexpected topic.\n\"I've only heard Instructor Chu's story; it's foolish to make a judgment one-sidedly. So, how about we also hear the story of the person involved?\"\n\"The person involved?\"\n\"I just received word from the medical wing. My youngest is awake.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon rose from his seat and left the Heavenly Demon Palace, and Yeom Ga-hwi also understood the Heavenly Demon's intention and followed behind.\nSo there I was, having just been given the full story by my Master and the Hall Master.\n'...Wait. So his side effect wasn’t that he was gay?’\nOnly then did I realize that I had been misunderstanding Instructor Chu Il-hwan all this time.\nThanks to that, a question I had completely forgotten could also be resolved.\nOf why Instructor Chu Il-hwan’s strikes were laced with killing intent every time we clashed. Unless necrophilia was his preference, attacking like that was just plain crazy.\nIt was a question I had completely forgotten while being tormented by the Demonic Physician immediately after awakening from the incident.\nBut once the question disappeared, it was replaced by sheer, dumbfounded disbelief.\n‘Are you telling me that all those times I felt a chill down my spine, it wasn't my purity in danger, but my fucking life?!’\nWhat in the actual fuck were these senile old bastards thinking, putting a psycho with homicidal urges in charge of students?",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 117",
    "content": "Chapter 117: Reform (3)\n“Not only did you hire a dangerous man to be an instructor, you also assigned him to watch me ?”\nI couldn't hold back any longer and voiced my question.\nThe answer I got was fucking unbelievable.\n“Side effects are a price one must pay for learning the Demonic Arts. Who among those qualified to be an instructor in the Hall of the Demonic Way is free of them?”\n\".......\"\nRight. This place is full of lunatics.\nBut still.\n\"Isn't it too dangerous for an instructor teaching students to have murderous impulses as a side effect?\"\n\"...It's my fault that you've fallen into danger. It's the Hall Master's duty to supervise the instructors, yet I've put you in harm's way instead. As the Hall Master of the Hall of the Demonic Way, I apologize to you.\"\nThe moment the Hall Master finished speaking, Master jumped to his defense.\n“It is fine, Hall Master Yeom. These things happen when one learns Demonic Art. We're just reacting sensitively because there are those targeting Il-mok right now. Looking at the incident alone, it's nothing particularly special.\"\nListening to this was giving me a headache all over again.\n'Seriously, what the fuck am I supposed to do with these psycho cultist fanatics?’\nWhen you combine a cult with Demonic Arts, you get a problem with no goddamn solution.\nCome to think of it, it wasn't just the adults who were affected.\n'Jeong Hyeon became severely antisocial after gaining enlightenment, and that bastard Baek Cheon went completely insane. Bang Mi-hwa seems to have gotten stranger recently too.'\nAnd that was just looking at the people I was ‘relatively’ close to. All of this had happened in the mere six months since I’d entered the Hall.\nI wasn’t any different; getting tangled up in a few incidents had made my own side effects worse.\n'At least I have an adult's mind, so I can handle it myself, but what sin have these kids committed?'\nThey were sixteen by Western count. In my old world, they’d be high school freshmen. And that was just the ones in the Hall. I’d heard Seol-ah started learning the Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art when she was just ten years old.\nYou take the emotional turmoil of puberty and pile on the side effects of Demonic Arts, and what you get are generations of completely fucked-up men and women.\nNo, wait… could this environment be the very reason all the adults in the Demonic Cult were batshit insane in the first place?\nAs my thoughts fixated on the Cult’s completely broken system…\n'Shit.'\nOnce again, the side effect that had been dormant in a corner of my mind began to rear its ugly head.\nI was sure of it now.\n‘My realm definitely went up. Damn it.’\nBefore waking up, I had barely managed to suppress the side effects, but that was merely preventing a full-blown rampage at best.\nI couldn't ignore the voice screaming in my head any longer. I had no choice but to speak.\n\"Master.\"\n\"Yes, my disciple.\"\n“In six months, the first graduates from the school program across the branches in Xinjiang will emerge, right?”\n\"That's correct.\"\n\"And according to the original plan, among those children, those with exceptional martial talent will receive additional martial arts training, while those with literary talent will be taught administration or medicine, correct?\"\n\"Your Eldest Brother is already taking responsibility and making preparations. Is there some problem?\"\n\"When educating children with exceptional martial talent, can we delay the age at which they begin learning Demonic Arts? Preferably until after they turn sixteen. Ah! Rather than just those children, it would be best if you, Master, made an official announcement forbidding the learning of Demonic Arts before the age of sixteen.\"\nAs soon as I finished speaking, Master and everyone else in the room looked at me as if I'd lost my mind.\nEven Yeom Ga-hwi, who always maintained a stern expression, stared at me like I had just sprouted a second head.\n“…We were discussing Instructor Chu Il-hwan. What is this nonsense you’re suddenly spouting?\"\n\"It's because of what I've observed during my six months at the Hall of the Demonic Way. Not only have my own side effects worsened, but I've watched my peers and senior students grow more insane by the day.\"\n\"Aren't these fitting prices for learning Demonic Arts?\"\nAt Master's counter point, I barely managed to suppress a sigh.\nNo matter how much Master cared for me, the moment I sighed at the Heavenly Demon's words, the Hall Master or Jin Hayeon watching from the side would likely aim for my neck.\n“Master, a human being is composed of body and mind. However, these two are not separate entities. When the mind becomes disturbed, the body becomes disturbed as well. By the same token, when the body becomes disturbed, the mind becomes disturbed too. So let me ask you, Master, when does a person’s body undergo its most drastic changes?”\nA subtle shift occurred in Master’s expression as if he’d caught on to something.\n'Phew. Thank goodness he gets it with just a little explanation.’\nIn modern times, I’d be throwing around words like ‘hormones’ and citing scientific evidence, but that approach wouldn't work in this era.\nI had to explain it in terms they’d understand, but since no suitable examples came to mind, I was speaking at such length.\n‘I never would have guessed that a concept like ‘mind-body unity’ wouldn't exist in this world.'\nStill, Master seemed to understand to some degree, so I quickly continued my explanation.\n\"Though it varies from person to person, generally, the period between twelve and sixteen is when the body changes most dramatically. And since mind and body are connected, this is also when the mind undergoes the most turbulent changes. So then, is it truly safe to learn Demonic Arts during this period when the mind is already at its most unstable?\"\nMaster turned his head to look at the Demonic Physician who was still in the room.\n\"What do you think, Demonic Physician? As a doctor, do you think Il-mok’s words hold true?”\nThe physician stroked his beard with a look of fascination on his face.\n“It is a question I have never considered, so it is difficult for me to judge it right or wrong on the spot, but there does seem to be a sufficient possibility. The only issue is that I have only ever treated those who learned Demonic Arts from a young age, so I have no proper cases for comparison.”\nThen, Jin Hayeon timidly raised her hand.\n\"Lord of Ten Thousand Demons. May this humble girl offer a word?\"\n\"Speak.\"\n\"Before entering the Hall of the Demonic Way, I lived in a rural village and was taught Demonic Arts by my parents. During that time, I often observed villagers who had not learned Demonic Arts. Just as Young Master Il-mok said, the village elders often spoke of how children of that age were the most rebellious.\"\nI had no idea why she was suddenly backing me up, but I seized the opportunity and ran with it.\n\"I too lived among the common folk before joining the Cult, Master. From what I observed, the minds of children that age were constantly agitated and turbulent. Like being tossed by fierce winds and giant waves.\"\nMaster nodded once at my explanation and asked.\n\"So you're saying we should avoid that period when learning Demonic Arts?\"\nHonestly, I wanted to say no.\n'Forget sixteen, they should be at least twenty.'\nBut Demonic Arts were the foundation of this Cult. The moment I suggested they shouldn’t be learned at all, my head would be on a pike.\nThen wouldn't it be better to learn them after becoming adults? It’s not like kids suddenly develop the wisdom of a sage the day after puberty ends.\nHowever, those old fogies in the Cult would raise a storm. If I suddenly said people should wait until they’re twenty, the backlash would be severe.\nJust like right now.\n\"Lord of Ten Thousand Demons! You must not be swayed by such insidious words!”\nHall Master Yeom Ga-hwi prostrated himself as if he were some loyal retainer, shouting his fierce opposition with a face that risked his life.\n\"The age for entering the Hall of the Demonic Way is sixteen, yet you forbid learning Demonic Arts until sixteen. This is impossible!\"\n“There’s a simple solution for that. We just need to raise the entry age for the Hall to eighteen.”\nWhen I countered him with a dismissive tone, Yeom Ga-hwi glared at me as if he wanted me dead.\n“Do you truly not understand that if we do so, the delay in learning will cause a drastic decline in the average capabilities of our Cult’s martial artists?!”\n“With all due respect, Hall Master, I believe your thinking is too confined to the Hall of the Demonic Way.”\n\"What did you say!!\"\nBy delaying the start of Demonic Arts training to sixteen and the Hall’s entry to eighteen, the number of children who will begin learning will increase severalfold. So, instead of worrying about the delay, we just need to increase the Hall's capacity.\" Googlᴇ search Nov3lFɪre.ɴet\n\"!!!\"\nWhile Yeom Ga-hwi hesitated, Master asked in a gentle tone.\n“Are you suggesting we choose quantity over quality?”\n“Only at the very beginning, Master. The growth rate of Demonic Arts is unparalleled by any other martial art. Ultimately, everyone grows at a rapid rate until they reach their own personal limit. In fact, with a more stable mind, that wall will likely come much later. So please think about it in reverse. The number of children learning these arts is about to multiply. If all their minds are unstable, can we truly handle the fallout?”\nFor some reason, Master burst into hearty laughter at my question.\n\"Haha. So that's why you suggested increasing the Hall's capacity. By learning later, the children’s minds will be more mature. Naturally, even with increased numbers, a certain level of control will be possible.”\nAt Master's interpretation, Yeom Ga-hwi looked at me with a shocked expression. He looked like he was asking if I had really thought that far ahead.\nOf course, my goddamn side effect had indeed thought that far.\n\"That's correct. However, as a precaution, and to maintain the quality of education, we would need to increase the number of instructors and assistants to match the larger student body. Therefore, this is not something to be implemented immediately, but prepared for gradually.”\n“Hmm. As you say, even if we forbid learning before sixteen, the children who have already learned will be a problem. We could have them enter the Hall as it is now, and then in three or four years, we can raise the entry age.”\n“Yes. We can use that time to slowly build the foundation, Master.”\nHearing my answer, Master nodded with a satisfied expression and said. “You have come up with a truly commendable idea.”\n“The things I saw in the Demonic Way were part of it, but honestly, the first person who came to mind was Seol-ah.”\n\"You mean that girl from the Hyeokryeon Family?\"\n“Yes. From the moment I first saw her, I felt it was a pity that too heavy a burden was being placed on such a young child.”\n“Hahaha! To think this is happening in my own family’s house, and yet the thought never even occurred to this old man. I've taken it too much for granted all this time.\"\nMaster seemed already sufficiently convinced, but the Hall Master's expression was still sour. And I was willing to bet his reaction was the same as most of the old geezers in the Cult’s leadership.\nTo prevent another outbreak of my damned side effects, I opened my mouth again.\n\"Furthermore, this is in alignment with the very principles of our Cult, Master.\"\n\"Oh? Our Cult's principles?\"\n“Yes, Master. What is the great cause of our Heavenly Demon Divine Cult? To punish the wicked with martial might. This is why we select our leader through martial might, and why those with exceptional martial arts sit in high positions, isn't it?\"\nI had barely gotten the words out before Master’s eyes lit up, a sign he had already grasped my intent.\nBut to help others understand as well, he deliberately responded to my words as if adding commentary.\n“It is so. But what does that have to do with delaying the age for learning Demonic Arts?”\n“Because it will allow us to discover children with martial talent that truly fit our doctrine. By teaching children throughout Xinjiang through schools, we identify their talents. And by making them begin learning Demonic Arts at the same time at age sixteen, their ranks will be determined purely by effort and talent. Not like now, where children get ahead simply because they were lucky enough to have good parents and learned Demonic Arts first, creating hereditary succession among the Cult's leadership.\"\n\"!!!\"\nAs soon as I finished speaking, the Hall Master looked at me with a shocked expression.\n\"Moreover, learning Demonic Arts in our cult serves not only to quickly become strong and save the masses, but also has the meaning of self-cultivation—to overcome the side effects of Demonic Arts. Is that not why you, Master, put me through various tests before accepting me as your disciple?”\nMaybe because I mentioned our first meeting, Master smiled warmly like an old man lost in memories.\n“Hahaha. You remember it well.”\n\"Yes, Master. That's precisely why I believe we should delay when one learns Demonic Arts even more. We must allow the doctrines and will of the Cult to be firmly established in their minds during their youth, when these side effects do not yet torment them. Only after that, when they learn Demonic Arts, will they grow into warriors who are truly in accord with the Cult’s principles. And on that note, we have a very excellent example right here.”\nWhile everyone looked at me with puzzled expressions, I turned my head while lying down and looked at Jin Hayeon.\n\"Born in a remote branch, taught by parents who were mere branch warriors, yet she entered the Hall of the Demonic Way through talent and effort alone. Despite learning White Hand Demonic Art only after she got admitted to the Demonic Way, she not only graduated second in her year but also became a true believer who never forgot our cult's doctrine. Is that not a true believer, standing right there?”\nI’d heard so much praise about Jin Hayeon from Ju Seo-yeon that her story came to mind naturally.\nBut for some reason...\nAs the gazes of my master, the physician, and the Hall Master all followed mine to land on Jin Hayeon, her eyes—usually so calm and detached—were turbulent, practically shaking with intense emotion when she stared back at me.\n'Hmm. Did I just step on a landmine?'\nIt seemed bringing her up without permission had struck a nerve. Seeing how her face had turned red, I figured she must be seriously pissed off.",

    "content": "Chapter 118: Reform (4)\nJin Hayeon, who had been looking at me for a moment, returned to her usual calm expression and looked at Master.\n\"Those are overly generous words of praise.\"\n“Hahaha. I don't think Il-mok said anything untrue.”\nMaster, stroking his beard with the relaxed face of a country elder, suddenly turned serious and looked at me.\n\"Very well. I'll follow your opinions regarding the Hall of the Demonic Way and the children's education. However, that’s not the most pressing issue at hand, is it?”\nOnly now did the Hall Master of the Demonic Way seem to regain his senses, his surprised face returning to its usual stern expression.\n\"That's correct, Young Master Il-mok. We must first deal with Instructor Chu Il-hwan's matter.\"\nRight. The original topic wasn't the fucked up education policy of the Demonic Cult.\nIt was about how to handle Chu Il-hwan who had attacked me, and whether Chu Il-hwan was truly a mole.\nThe only problem was...\n'This goddamn side effect.’\nMy head was already spinning from the side effects, and once again it was starting to wring out every last drop of knowledge and wisdom I had.\nAnd it was all connecting back to that damn education policy.\n\"Instructor Chu Il-hwan's matter can also be handled in connection with the Cult's educational system, Master.\"\n\"???\"\nEven Master looked at me with a face full of questions, as if he hadn't expected this.\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n“Didn't we just decide to reform the Hall of the Demonic Way over the next three or four years before we raise the entry age? We can solve this problem through that reform.”\n“Be specific.”\n\"Most of the students in the Hall of the Demonic Way have already learned Demonic Arts from a young age, leaving their minds unstable. And this applies to the instructors as well. Therefore, we should now station a physician from the Pure Mind Hall permanently at the Hall of the Demonic Way. For regular counseling and treatment.\"\n\"While that's a sound idea, I don't understand what it has to do with Instructor Chu Il-hwan's matter.\"\nMaster asked on everyone's behalf, but they all wore equally puzzled expressions.\n\"First, maintaining Chu Il-hwan's instructor position without holding him accountable in the current situation would be problematic.\"\nI added an explanation for Master, who was tilting his head.\n“If Instructor Chu really is the mole, then expelling him solves the problem. But if he's not, then we're playing right into their hands. If we bring in another of the Hall Master's associates to fill Chu Il-hwan's vacant position, wouldn't that also be problematic? So, why not give the role of a secret agent to the physician from the Pure Mind Hall instead of a new instructor?”\nEven with my additional explanation, Master looked puzzled.\n“This old man could simply say, I personally selected the new instructor. Is there really a need to go through such a troublesome process?\"\nSpoken like the true leader of a fanatic cult. A classic move from a pope who wields absolute power, completely oblivious to the possibility of anyone disagreeing. But because of that very mindset, there were things he couldn't see.\n“On the contrary, Master. We can use the new instructor position as bait.”\n“I see! A scheme to monitor whoever takes the new position, is it?”\n\"It would be difficult for me alone, but with the physician dispatched to the Hall of the Demonic Way, it should be quite possible, shouldn't it? Furthermore, the physician will conduct regular counseling sessions with cadets and instructors. When people talk for long enough, they inevitably make a slip of the tongue.”\nMaster stroked his beard.\n“Hahaha. And on top of that, by investigating those who recommended the new instructor, we might even be able to root out the entire conspiracy.”\nMaster nodded with a satisfied expression and asked me, \"To use the instructor position as bait, it seems best to dismiss Instructor Chu Il-hwan first. Don't you want to impose any punishment other than dismissal?\"\n\"Rather than additional punishment, it would be better to send him to the Pure Mind Hall, as was done with Warrior Kwan Mu-yeol.\"\n“Will that be sufficient?”\n“Yes, Master. This all happened because he couldn't control the side effects of his art, so he is in need of counseling and treatment. Also, if Instructor Chu Il-hwan is indeed a mole, we might catch some clues during the counseling process.\"\n\"Truly meticulous work as always.\"\nAt Master's praise, I almost gritted my teeth without realizing it.\n\"...I believe it's because I learned the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword. Ahem .\"\nDamn side effects.\nAll I wanted was to lie down and rest, but my brain refused to shut up. In a way, the side effects of Demonic Arts were a lot like school bullying.\n'Side effects! Stop!'\nYou could scream it all you want. They weren’t going to listen.\nDid he sense my condition?\n\"Well then, it seems we've decided on the direction for Instructor Chu Il-hwan's matter.\"\nMy Master looked at me, a glimmer of anticipation in his eyes.\n“Besides sending a physician to the Hall, do you have any other ideas for reform? Hahaha. Even if they're just thoughts that sprang from your side effects, speak your mind freely.”\nHe looked like a greedy farmer staring at the goose that laid golden eggs.\nAnd the damn side effects took the bait. \"That's right!\"\n\"For children who are still in their growth period, the Hall of the Demonic Way is too bleak. Since they're already suffering from side effects, they need some time to breathe. Therefore, I suggest we form clubs.\"\n\"Clubs? What are those?\"\n\"As the name suggests, they're gatherings of people who like the same things.\"\nI borrowed the concept from the clubs that existed during my middle and high school days.\nOf course, in a system as obsessed with college entrance exams as Korea’s, they were mostly for show, but things were different here.\n“In fact, among the current students, there are two whose mental states have stabilized and whose martial cultivation has even improved by immersing themselves in acting and theater.”\nIn a world like this, if you told them something helped with Demonic Arts, they’d make it mandatory. In fact, the reason I thought of clubs was precisely because the cases of Bang Mi-hwa and Baek Cheon had come to mind.\nAnd since the topic was about students, Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi jumped in like he knew something.\n\"Are you referring to Disciple Baek Cheon and Disciple Bang Mi-hwa?\"\n\"That's correct, Hall Master. Currently, those two and several other students are meeting privately, but wouldn’t it be safer to formally introduce the concept of clubs and have them run with an instructor present?”\nI rambled on, giving examples of various other clubs like a tea ceremony club or a doctrine study group, explaining how clubs could be operated irrespective of class year, creating a space for seniors and juniors to mingle. I rambled on about the operational plans and benefits of the club system.\n\"If each instructor takes charge of one club, it should be quite feasible to implement.\"\nSure, it meant the instructors would be saddled with extra work outside of teaching hours, but that wasn't my problem.\nAfter spouting a few more opinions related to reforming the Hall, my side effects finally began to quiet down.\n\"Phew.\"\nI felt exhausted both mentally and physically from talking nonstop.\n“Oh dear, it seems I have overworked you when your body has not yet fully recovered.”\nOnly now did Master speak with concern, as a master should.\nIf he was going to worry, he should have stopped me earlier. It's absurd to say such things after hearing everything he wanted to hear.\n“For now, we will proceed with your suggestions regarding Instructor Chu and the reform of the Hall. Hall Master Yeom has heard it all as well, so I trust he understands.”\nThe Hall Master bowed with his stern face.\n“If the Supreme One commands it, this servant will obey with a joyful heart.”\nHe seemed to have finally accepted my argument; his attitude of absolute opposition had completely disappeared.\nPleased with the Hall Master's response, Master nodded and stood up.\n\"Since reforming the Hall of the Demonic Way and the educational system will take time, I should first issue the order prohibiting Demonic Arts education for those under sixteen.\"\nHe said it calmly, but it was a big deal.\nTo put it differently, he was issuing a ban on advanced learning.\nIf this were modern Korea, parents would have rioted, and illegal, secret tutoring would have become rampant.\nBut here, I didn’t have to worry about that.\n'When you look at it this way, cults are convenient in their own way.'\nThis was an order from the Heavenly Demon, a man worshipped as a god by every member of the Cult. If you ignored his command and secretly conducted advanced learning, they could be branded as heretics and have their limbs severed or die.\nMaster and the Hall Master left to handle business, and the Demonic Physician also soon left the medical wing.\n\"......\"\n\"......\"\nWith only Jin Hayeon and me left in the room, a strange silence descended.\nShe was always quiet, but after what had just happened, the silence felt… uncomfortable.\nAnd for some reason, Jin Hayeon spoke first.\n\"I didn't know you thought of me that way, Young Master.\"\nI don’t know… maybe it was her uncharacteristically awkward expression, but her words sounded strangely sarcastic.\n\" Ahem . I'm sorry for talking about Miss Jin without permission. Still, my words were meant in a good way, so I hope you understand.”\n\"...I understand.\"\nWith that, silence fell upon the room once more.\nJust as I was about to speak to break the silence...\n“I will leave you to rest.”\nWith her red face, she left the medical room, leaving a cold wind swirling around her.\nShe really must have been pissed.\n'I didn't even insult her, so why is she acting like that?'\nHonestly, I felt wronged.\n\"Phew.\"\nThe moment she stepped out of the room, Jin Hayeon let out a deep sigh with an unusually complicated expression.\n'...I never expected him to say such things.'\nShe had never anticipated that he would praise her so highly in front of the great Heavenly Demon.\nOf course, she had received countless compliments before.\nEven when she lived in a rural branch as a child, the village elders had praised her countless times, and after entering the Hall of the Demonic Way, she often heard words of praise from Ouyang Mun, assistant instructors, and instructors.\nThe fact that Ouyang Mun’s compliments back then were delivered with a sarcastic sneer as he tried to hide his feelings was a slight issue, but still.\nAnyway, even after graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way, she often received praise at the Hidden Guard Pavilion, and Ouyang Mun.\nBut none of it had ever moved her.\nMaybe when she was a child, but certainly not after she had learned the White Hand Demonic Art.\nOuyang Mun’s praise had always felt a little sickening, but otherwise, she strongly felt it was just something people said.\nBut why? Why had Il-mok’s praise made her heart pound like this?\nIt might have been because she heard the praise in front of the Heavenly Demon, whom she respected immensely, or because, unlike Ouyang Mun's empty praise, it was praise about something she truly took pride in.\nMaybe it was because she had finally received acknowledgment from Il-mok, a man she had truly come to see as her lord. Or maybe it was due to some emotion she herself did not yet recognize.\nFor her, who had been erasing emotions while learning the White Hand Demonic Art, such feelings were so unfamiliar that she couldn't properly recognize her own emotions.\nHowever, one thing was certain.\n'If I had stayed there any longer, my Demonic Arts would have been shaken.'\nThe single jolt of emotion had made it feel burdensome to continue facing Young Master Il-mok.\n'Is this the joy of being recognized?' The rıghtful source is novel{f}ire.net\nShe decided to categorize this feeling as nothing more than a subordinate’s joy at being recognized by her master and composed herself.\n'The White Hand Demonic Art isn't a martial art that only discards evil emotions. I can't disappoint the Young Master.'\nOnly by being able to discard even a feeling like joy could one truly reach the state of Extremity.\nShe immediately sat down in the lotus position and began to circulate the White Hand Demonic Art.\nTo become a person useful to Il-mok, she would willingly freeze away every last one of her emotions.",

    "content": "Chapter 119: Reform (5)\nJin Hayeon returned to the infirmary about an hour after she’d stormed out.\n\"I'll perform another round of treatment on you, Young Master.\"\nShe was radiating an arctic chill, somehow even frostier than before.\n‘Seriously? Is she really this pissed off?’\nIt was quite an unfair situation in many ways, but I was in no position to argue.\nI don’t want the hassle of arguing with a person who radiates such a cold aura.\n\"Snore.\"\nNot long after her acupuncture treatment began, I fell fast asleep.\nBetween my body being utterly wrecked from my Demonic Art’s rampage and my brain being fried from nonstop debates about disinfectant, educational reform, and Instructor Chu Il-hwan’s clusterfuck of a case, I was running on empty. The second her cool touch graced my skin, my body gave up the fight against exhaustion.\nAnd the next day was no different.\nI woke up to Jin Hayeon performing her treatment, having no clue when or where the woman ever slept.\nThen the Demonic Physician showed up to poke me full of needles again.\nRight after the morning treatment ended.\n\"Youngest!\"\nThe short-fused boar—I mean, my Eldest Brother—came to visit.\n“I heard the news from Master. You’re completely overhauling our Cult’s entire education system!”\n\"Well, things just kind of ended up that way, Eldest Brother.”\n\"Haha. Thanks to you, this Eldest Brother's workload has increased. I was planning to teach the children Demonic Arts after they finished their school in half a year, but now all those plans have been scrapped, so I'll have to start everything from scratch.\"\n\".......\"\nHe’s pissed at me. This is him telling me he’s pissed, right?\nCold sweat naturally began trickling down my back.\nA cold sweat trickled down my back. I’d just dropped a work-bomb of epic proportions on a man with a short fuse. It wouldn’t have surprised me if he’d decided to kill me right then and there.\n\"I'm, I'm sorry, Eldest Brother. Please, spare my life...\"\n\"Life? What are you talking about? You’ve done something magnificent! Why in the world would I want to harm my brilliant, pride-and-joy of a younger brother? Mwahahaha!”\n\"???\"\nI couldn’t tell if he was being sarcastic or sincere. Then, his voice dropped to a serious tone.\n\"The reason this foolish Eldest Brother came to see you today was partly because I was worried about your injuries, but truthfully, it was more to seek your advice.\"\n\"My advice...?\"\n\"With this foolish Eldest Brother's dull mind, I cannot fully grasp our brilliant youngest's plan. So I thought it would be better to hear the story directly from you, which is why I came here.\"\n\"My plan? What do you mean by that?\"\nWhen I asked with a puzzled expression, Eldest Brother answered with a face that said it was obvious.\n“Hahaha! No need to play dumb to spare my feelings, youngest. A genius like you must have planned out every last detail. So tell me. How do I teach these children the way you envisioned it?”\n\".......\"\nWhat the hell is this guy smoking?\n‘Oh, for the love of all that is holy.’\nThat other part of me, the one I hated, started slyly kicking down the door to my consciousness.\n\"If we consider the school program as a type of basic education, then what Eldest Brother needs to prepare could be called elementary and middle school education. The Hall of the Demonic Way would then serve as our institution of higher learning.”\nHaving memories of the modern world was a goddamn curse for someone who’d learned the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\nMy mind was instantly flooded with the familiar structure of elementary, middle, high school, and university.\nCombine that with all the administrative bullshit I’d learned as a civil servant, and my mouth started moving on its own.\n\"Since the schools are managed by the regional branches, we first need facilities to accommodate children who have completed their basic studies. However, realistically, it’s impossible to house and manage all the children from across Xinjiang. Moreover, continuously separating young children from their parents could be harmful to their mental health. So, to start, we should group the villages into clusters of four or five and build elementary education facilities in the largest village of each cluster.” The source of thɪs content is novèlfire.net\nAs my mouth began moving non-stop, Eldest Brother pulled out paper and brush from who knows where and began frantically writing everything down.\n\"Master's words were true. He said you'd give answers if I just asked. Hehehe.\"\nHe muttered a comment that made a vein throb in my forehead.\n'So it was Master who told Eldest Brother about my side effects!'\nBut my anger was quickly overshadowed by a new horror. My eyes were glued to the tip of his brush. Soon, I fell silent, my eyes twitching as I stared at his calligraphy.\n'Is this some new form of torture?'\nHow should I put it...\nTo put it nicely, it was bold and unrestrained handwriting. To be brutally honest, the man needed to be sent back to the academy for basic penmanship lessons.\nWith my side effect already rearing its ugly head, staring at that chaotic chicken scratch handwriting made me feel like I might suffer from Qi Deviation again.\n‘Forget the fact that it looks like shit, why the hell is he writing so big?!’\nI had plenty more to say due to the side effects, but already half the paper was filled, all because of his uselessly oversized handwriting.\n\"...What's wrong, youngest?\"\nEldest Brother, who had been busily taking notes, looked at me with a puzzled expression when I fell silent.\nBut instead of immediately opening my mouth, I first raised my body from lying down.\n\"Ugh.\"\n\"Young Master?\"\n“Wh-what’s wrong? Is there a problem!?”\nJin Hayeon and Eldest Brother, who had been watching from the side, looked at me with concern. I turned to Jin Hayeon first.\n\"Could you help me sit up? I think I need to sit for a bit.\"\n“…Very well. The Elder Demonic Physician did say that moving a little would help with muscle recovery.”\nFinally, with Jin Hayeon's support, I raised my upper body. Then I extended my right hand toward Eldest Brother.\n\"I'll write it myself, Eldest Brother.\"\n“Nonsense. How could I let my injured brother handle such a task?”\nHis consideration made me want to puke.\n‘Because what you’re doing is pure fucking TORTURE!’\nBut I couldn’t say that to the short-fused boar who could snap my neck at any moment.\n“It would be far more accurate if I wrote it myself rather than having you transcribe my words, don’t you think? Besides, I need to move a little anyway to recover faster. I’ll just think of it as exercise.”\n“Your consideration for your foolish Eldest Brother truly warms my heart.”\nFor some reason, Eldest Brother looked deeply moved as he handed me the brush and paper.\n'I'd rather die than suffer like this. Ugh.'\nAfter sighing inwardly, I moved my mouth while writing on the paper.\nAnd Eldest Brother, who had been obediently listening to my words, soon looked back and forth between me and the paper with a surprised expression and exclaimed:\n“I knew you were a genius, brother, but I never imagined you were also well-versed in calligraphy!”\n“…I studied hard to enter the Hall of the Demonic Way. This just came naturally.”\nThe real reason was my damn side effect, but I just fed him a plausible lie.\nAs I explained the education system and wrote it all down in neat, orderly script, the muscle pain that had been plaguing me started to dull. I didn’t know whether to be happy or sad about it since it was all thanks to this goddamn side effect.\nAnd so, I battled my side effect, blending modern knowledge with my own insights, and the time flew by.\n“The Young Master’s body is still weak. I believe it would be best to rest for today.”\nThe moment Jin Hayeon gave her gentle but firm dismissal and my Eldest Brother left, she performed the acupressure on me again.\nAnd thanks to my exhausted mind and body, I fell fast asleep again.\n\"Youngest!\"\nThe next day, Eldest Brother came again.\n\"For middle school education, it would be best to select about thirty to fifty percent of the talented children among the sixteen-year-olds who have completed elementary education and gather them at headquarters.\"\nDay after day, I was tormented by Eldest Brother, and I was forced to run my mouth and my brush nonstop.\nHow should I put it...\nIt felt like I had become a kind of knowledge dispenser, just eating meals and spitting out knowledge day after day.\nAround the time Il-mok was being tormented by Wi Jin-hak.\nYeom Ga-hwi, who had returned to the Hall of the Demonic Way, was carrying out the Heavenly Demon's instructions.\n\"...You're saying it ends with dismissal from the instructor position?\"\nAt Vice Hall Master Yu Geuk's question, Yeom Ga-hwi nodded with an impassive face.\n\"These are orders from the Supreme One. Since he couldn't control the side effects of demonic arts, he's not suitable as an instructor. However, since this happened due to side effects, he's been ordered to receive counseling and treatment to manage those side effects at the Pure Mind Hall.\"\nBecause it was an order from the Heavenly Demon himself, Yu Geuk didn’t argue further.\n\"Then we'll need to select a new instructor.\"\n\"Indeed. Do you have anyone you'd like to recommend?\"\n\"...Having stayed at the Hall of the Demonic Way as a Vice Hall Master for so long, I'm not well-versed in the Cult's current situation. Rather than making an immediate recommendation, let me look into it.\"\n“Do so. Also, until a new instructor arrives, you, Vice Hall Master, will be in charge of martial arts training in Instructor Chu’s stead.”\n\"I will do so, Hall Master.\"\nAfter finishing his conversation with Yu Geuk, Yeom Ga-hwi headed to where Chu Il-hwan was being held.\nCreak.\nAt the sound of Yeom Ga-hwi opening the door and entering, Chu Il-hwan, who had been sitting bound to the chair with his head bowed, looked up.\n“The verdict has been delivered.”\nA complex expression washed over Chu Il-hwan’s face.\nYeom Ga-hwi looked at the man, who was now staring at him like a kicked puppy, and repeated what he had told Yu Geuk.\nAfter hearing his sentence, Chu Il-hwan, still looking conflicted, asked, “…To the Pure Mind Hall?”\n\"That's right.\"\n“…Do you believe me, Hall Master?\"\n“This wasn’t my decision. It was the decision of Disciple Il-mok and the Supreme One.”\nAs he answered, Yeom Ga-hwi recalled the events of the previous day.\n‘The rumors called him a genius, but I never imagined it was to this extent.’\nHe’d already seen Il-mok’s talent in martial arts firsthand, having even observed one of his tests due to his doubts.\nHowever, this was the first time he had directly experienced that widely rumored brilliance.\n‘It was like he knew everything from the very start. Yes. As if he were speaking from knowledge rather than wisdom.'\nFrom the educational system to the Hall of the Demonic Way reform plan—the words he spouted nonstop contained not a trace of weakness.\nEven Yeom Ga-hwi himself, who had intended to voice strong opposition, found himself just silently listening at some point.\nThere wasn't even a flicker of hesitation in Il-mok’s eyes; it was as if he were simply reading facts from a scroll.\n‘Now I think I understand why the Supreme One treasures his youngest disciple so much.’\nThe handling of Chu Il-hwan was the same.\nIt linked perfectly with his proposed reforms, making it feel like a natural, seamless solution.\nOf course, contrary to Chu Il-hwan's thoughts, neither Il-mok nor the Heavenly Demon had completely trusted and forgiven him.\nThe process of receiving counseling at the Pure Mind Hall was closer to a ploy to get him to slip up and reveal something incriminating.\nBut Yeom Ga-hwi wasn’t stupid enough to tell Chu Il-hwan that.\n‘If he’s innocent, he has nothing to fear.’\nAnd if he was guilty, Yeom Ga-hwi believed, he deserved whatever punishment he got, even if he was a favored subordinate.\nOblivious to Yeom Ga-hwi’s true thoughts, Chu Il-hwan, who believed he was now in the clear, had a very different take on things.\n‘A verdict delivered by the Supreme One and Disciple Il-mok?’\nChu Il-hwan felt as if he had been struck hard in the head.\n‘I could understand our Lord, but Disciple Il-mok… I almost killed him.’\nEven if it was because of his art’s side effects, for Il-mok to forgive him…\n‘Perhaps… perhaps I have gravely misunderstood Disciple Il-mok.’\nEverything he had observed while spying on Il-mok for the past month, he started to wonder if it was all a misunderstanding.\nThings like his lecherous behavior in bringing swarms of female students, and even having some kind of scandal with Instructor Eun Ryeo. Or his laziness, how he’d just swing his sword half-assedly during training and spend the rest of his time napping or staring into space.\nMaybe he had gotten it all wrong.\n‘I almost spread baseless rumors…’\nChu Il-hwan had planned to report his findings to the Hall Master once the real mole was caught, but now he decided to take this secret to his grave.\nFor Il-mok, this was an unimaginable stroke of luck.\nIf those matters had been reported to the Heavenly Demon through the Hall Master, there was no telling what kind of fresh hell would have been unleashed upon him.",

    "content": "Chapter 120: Reform (6)\nIn the office of the Vice Hall Master of the Demonic Way.\nYu Geuk, now in charge of martial arts training in place of Chu Il-hwan, was reviewing reports from the instructors on the cadets’ personal histories and cultivation levels.\nHe was deep in a discussion about training methods with one of the instructors when the man suddenly asked, “…What’s going to happen to Instructor Chu Il-hwan?”\nYu Geuk let out a light sigh.\n\"It ended with his dismissal from the instructor position.\"\n\"What? But that's too...\"\n“What can we do? It was an order from the Supreme One himself.”\n\"...This is truly regrettable.\"\n“It seems the Supreme One still hasn't withdrawn his suspicions.\"\nAt Yu Geuk's words, the instructor across from him muttered with a regretful expression.\n“It would have been better if it had all ended this time. I never expected the Young Master to survive Chu Il-hwan’s attack.”\nYu Geuk also nodded with a cold expression.\n“The Young Master’s skills were far beyond our estimations. I never imagined a boy that young could have reached such a level. Now I think I understand why that person is so concerned with a mere fledgling.”\nThe instructor nodded in agreement.\nThey both knew Il-mok was leagues ahead of the other students.\nBut still, a student was just a student. They had thought it would be impossible for him to withstand a full-blown rampage from Chu Il-hwan, one of the strongest instructors in the Hall.\n“…A little more time and he would have been dead for sure. If I’d known it would turn out like this, we should have waited for a better opportunity.”\nYu Geuk shot the disappointed instructor a sharp look and clicked his tongue.\n\"Tsk. Wasn't this opportunity also fortunate? As they say, overthinking leads to a poor choice. If we’d waited for a ‘better’ opportunity, we might never have gotten one at all.”\nThough they had devised a scheme to use Chu Il-hwan, the man himself was no pushover.\nTrying to create the perfect scenario could have easily backfired and led them straight back to them. The fact that the mole had coincidentally stumbled upon Chu Il-hwan when he was about to succumb to Qi Deviation was a once-in-a-lifetime stroke of luck.\nUnlike the regretful instructor, Yu Geuk quickly shook off his regret and coldly thought about future matters.\n“Forget it. At the very least, his dismissal leaves an instructor position open. This gives us a chance to bring in another ally. It will make things easier next time.”\nBetween his cold features, Yu Geuk's eyes gleamed with a predatory light.\nA few days later.\nWi Jin-hak emerged from the medical wing with a relieved expression while carrying a pile of documents.\nHe looked down at the documents that Il-mok had written for him one by one.\nThe characters were small and tightly packed, yet each line was sharp, alive, exquisitely formed.\nWhen Il-mok had first offered to write for him, Wi Jin-hak had been stunned by the quality of the calligraphy.\nBut now, rather than the handwriting, he was more amazed by the meaning contained in the words written here.\n'I knew he was a genius, but he still surprises his Eldest Brother every time.'\nThe documents contained a meticulously detailed plan for reforms that would need to be implemented steadily over the next five years.\nThe contents were so extensive that the stack in his hands was only a fraction of the total.\nA mountain of scrolls he’d received over the past few days was already piled high in his personal quarters.\nWi Jin-hak had no idea that Il-mok, forced to churn out these countless documents, was collapsing into a dead sleep the moment their daily meetings were over.\nRegardless, thanks to Il-mok’s help, Wi Jin-hak now had a clear roadmap for the monumental task ahead.\n‘First things first, I need to establish the elementary education institutions and create the curriculum.’\nAbout half a year remained until the first children who started attending the village schools would graduate.\nConsidering the sheer amount of work to be done, it was a ridiculously short amount of time, but it wasn’t an insurmountable problem.\n‘He said to just focus on building the facilities for the new students and creating their curriculum. The rest can be done next year.’\nThe plan was to map out the locations of all the branches across Xinjiang, group them into clusters of four or five, and designate one temple in each cluster as a central hub—preferably the one in the largest of the five villages. Once the children graduated from their local schools, they would be gathered at these hubs to begin their elementary education.\n'I need to build dormitories for the children to stay in, and for the mental stability of young children, I should designate holidays so they can return to their hometowns.'\nIl-mok had even boldly introduced the concept of holidays. It was a logical step since the whole point of delaying their Demonic Arts training was to protect their young minds.\n‘And since we won’t be teaching them Demonic Arts yet, he said it would be best to have them learn a basic internal energy cultivation method and foundational martial arts that won’t cause problems later when they convert their internal energy to demonic energy.’\nThose basic cultivation methods and fundamental martial arts would be created together by Wi Jin-hak, a natural-born martial artist, and Hang Geon and his subordinates, whom Il-mok had abducted.\nOn top of that, Il-mok had listed the subjects that needed to be included in the elementary curriculum. Basic arithmetic was included for those who might go into administration or medicine, and religious doctrine was mandatory. Intertwined with the doctrine was a parallel education on basic human morality.\n“How does a plan like this just pour out of that kid’s head? The more I learn, the less I understand him. Haha.”\nFor Wi Jin-hak, who believed that Il-mok had created everything from scratch rather than explaining what he had directly seen and experienced, he couldn't help but be amazed.\n“It seems there was some truth to Master’s little joke.”\nWi Jin-hak recalled the conversation he had with his master, the Heavenly Demon, before coming to seek Il-mok's advice.\nHe wasn’t blind to the fact that people were targeting his youngest brother. Furious, he had even gone to his revered master and proposed a drastic solution: tear the cult and the Hall of the Demonic Way upside down to root out the conspirators.\nBut his serene master had refused, saying it would harm the innocent. Then he had added something strange.\n—Jin-hak, a thought suddenly occurred to me. I wonder if these people are, in a way, Il-mok’s lucky charm. Hehehe.\nHe’d said that every time those bastards made a move, Il-mok’s growth was so rapid it was visible to the naked eye. Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs ⓝovelFire.net\nAnd Wi Jin-hak, a man who had already achieved Transcendence on a high-tier Demonic Art like the Raging Demon Sword Art, had noticed it himself during his recent interactions with Il-mok.\nThat Il-mok was already approaching Extremity.\n‘At this rate, he might reach Extremity by the time he comes of age.’\nIt was a staggering rate of growth, almost unprecedented in the hundreds of years of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult’s history.\n‘The kid’s only been in the cult for a year and a half. He’s growing even faster than Master did.’\nWi Jin-hak let out a hollow laugh and shook his head in disbelief.\nRight after Wi Jin-hak began his work in earnest.\nThroughout Xinjiang, members of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult began to move with frenzied purpose.\nSwoosh!\nThud! Thud!\nIn the villages chosen to host the new elementary education institutions, the sounds of axes splitting wood and hammers driving stakes echoed relentlessly.\nIt was a bizarre sight.\nSwoosh!\nA man who looked like a carpenter would swing his axe once, and a massive log would split clean in two.\nThud!\nAnother laborer would lift two giant tree trunks, one in each hand, and carry them as if they were nothing.\nIt would have been impossible for ordinary people, but these were all martial artists. They were just low-ranking warriors, not particularly high on the cult’s totem pole.\nOf course, that was by the cult's standards.\nIf you ordered martial artists from the Central Plains to chop wood and build houses, you’d likely have a rebellion on your hands.\nBut not these men.\n‘This is a sacred order from the Heavenly Demon!’\n‘Not a single mistake will be tolerated!’\nWith a manic gleam in their eyes, they simply threw every ounce of their being into carrying out the orders from above. Like the fanatical cultists they were.\nAnd it wasn’t just the low-ranking warriors who were being ground down by the work.\nSomewhere in the main headquarters, in the quarters of Wi Jin-hak, the Heavenly Demon’s First Disciple.\n\"Hah.\"\n\"That's not it. Considering the children's development, rather than including that technique, how about changing it like this?\"\nThere, led by Wi Jin-hak, along with Hang Geon and his former subordinates, plus several mid-level masters from the cult, they were researching basic martial arts and basic cultivation methods.\nOn top of that, they also had to compile textbooks containing basic knowledge to teach the children.\nHaving already spent several days and nights there, everyone's eyes had turned dark with exhaustion.\n\"Whew.\"\nAnd Wi Jin-hak, who seemed to be lost in solitary contemplation, suddenly got up and left his quarters.\nThe place he headed to was the Heavenly Demon Palace, his master's residence.\n\"Not enough people?\"\nThe Heavenly Demon tilted his head at Wi Jin-hak’s report.\n“Then just make each person do more work.”\nWi Jin-hak spoke again.\n“For now, those working on the front lines are sufficient, Master. The problem will arise after the Elementary Demon Hall begins to operate.”\nElementary Demon Hall was the name given to the institution that would now be responsible for children's elementary education.\nAnd Wi Jin-hak handed several letters he had prepared in advance to the Heavenly Demon.\nThese were the letters Il-mok had written.\nAfter reading them, the Heavenly Demon nodded in understanding.\n“So the problem is the instructors who will teach the children at the Elementary Demon Hall and the escorts responsible for the children's commuting.\"\n“Yes, Master. The people currently building the Elementary Demon Halls and creating the curriculum will have to start building next year’s facilities and curriculum as soon as this is done, so we cannot assign them to these new roles.”\nThe need for instructors was obvious, but the issue of escorts was something even the Heavenly Demon hadn’t considered.\nSince they were integrating four or five villages to create educational facilities and giving regular holidays, someone would have to escort them back to their home villages and bring them back again.\nThe problem was that if they ordered such young children to travel that long distance on their own, there was no telling what trouble might occur.\n\"Since they're young and would have difficulty walking such distances, we need to build carriages for the children, and we need horses or other livestock to pull those carriages. But the problem is, if we try to procure a large number of horses or livestock, we will either have to collect more money than usual from the followers or take their livestock.”\nSeeing Wi Jin-hak’s concern for the livelihood of the ordinary followers, the Heavenly Demon replied with a pleased smile.\n\"Hahaha. Don't worry. We can just build more carriages, and there is no need to procure livestock.”\n\"???\"\nWhen Wi Jin-hak looked at the Heavenly Demon with a puzzled face, the Heavenly Demon revealed the solution he had instantly devised.\n“Our cult is overflowing with masters. Why would we need the strength of animals to pull carts? The escorts can simply double as the ones who pull the carts.”\n\"!!! As expected of you, Master!!\"\nWi Jin-hak was once again filled with admiration at the Heavenly Demon’s wisdom in replacing livestock with people.\n‘Perhaps my youngest brother’s brilliance comes from you, Master!’",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 121",
    "content": "Chapter 121: Reform (7)\nThe next morning.\nThe core leadership of the Demonic Cult gathered in the Heavenly Demon Palace.\nEach and every one of them was the head of a major division, and among them stood several middle-aged warriors who commanded the cult’s martial forces.\nThe Heavenly Demon, who had summoned them all, set aside his usual folksy old man persona and spoke, his face stern and solemn.\n“I have called you all here today to begin a task that will shape the future of our great Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.”\nWith that opening, he laid out the education reform plan—the one Il-mok had conceived and Wi Jin-hak was now putting into action.\nSince the ban on Demonic Arts for those under sixteen had already been implemented, those gathered here had some general understanding of the situation.\nHowever, what the Heavenly Demon instructed them today was beyond their comprehension.\n“To ensure the Elementary Demon Halls are properly established, each department will select members to serve as instructors. Furthermore, a portion of the martial units will be reassigned as escorts so that children can travel to and from their home villages during the holidays.”\nThe Head of the Elder Council, Deng Fei, stepped forward and kneeled.\n“If it is a command from the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons, we are prepared to throw ourselves into a pit of fire. And we all understand that this is for the future of the cult. However… if we divert too many personnel to education, I fear we will lack the manpower to watch our enemies abroad and manage our own affairs at home.”\nHe wasn't the only one with that concern. Several other warriors followed Deng Fei’s lead, prostrating themselves before the Heavenly Demon.\nThe Heavenly Demon seemed to have expected this.\nHe showed no surprise at all.\nHe stroked his beard once, his solemn gaze sweeping over the prostrated men, and spoke again.\n\"The need to monitor external threats is a problem this old man is well aware of. However, internal governance is a somewhat different story. But as for internal affairs… that is a different story. It has been nearly two hundred years since our cult established itself in Xinjiang. Now, the only ones in Xinjiang who would raise their flags against our cult are vagrants who have drifted in from outside. For something of that level, I believe we could handle that while dealing with the process of escorting the children, no?\"\nHe was saying that he would use the martial units, who were already periodically patrolling the Xinjiang region and serving as a kind of surveillance force, as escorts for the children attending the Elementary Demon Hall.\n\"Furthermore, since the children will travel to and from their villages only once every ten days, the martial units can continue their surveillance duties by patrolling around each village during the remaining time. It's simply a matter of adding the task of escorting children once every ten days.\"\nIl-mok had initially proposed five days of education and two days of rest, but this was rejected by the Heavenly Demon.\nBut in a world where the concept of weekends didn't exist, resting for two out of seven days was deemed too lazy.\nThough it was a tragedy for the children, the system that eventually took shape was eight days of education and two days of rest.\nOn the eighth day, classes would run until noon, with children returning to their respective villages in the afternoon. They would rest for two days and then return to the Elementary Demon Hall with their escorts on the afternoon of the final holiday.\n\"And the matter of external threats is the same. While the invasion of those who threaten our Divine Cult is something we must be concerned about, I have no intention of attacking them first. To attack outsiders when we still lack strength would be nothing more than a pointless sacrifice for our own people.”\n\"!!!\"\n“It is our fault for being inadequate!”\n\"Please execute us!\"\nThose gathered began prostrating themselves again and confessing their sins without exception.\nThe Heavenly Demon frowned once and circulated his internal energy.\nThe vast and weighty demonic energy of the Heavenly Demon Divine Arts spread from his body and pressed down on all sides; those gathered in the Heavenly Demon Palace didn't dare to even open their mouths.\n\"Listen to the end.\"\nHaving silenced them all in an instant, the Heavenly Demon continued in a voice full of authority.\n“Why do you think we are educating not only the children of the warriors who have joined our cult and learned our arts, but the children of all our followers living in Xinjiang?”\n\".......\"\nThe leaders remained silent, not daring to speak. The Heavenly Demon answered his own question.\n“We may be reducing our external surveillance for now, but in ten, twenty years, we will have cultivated twice, no, three times as many talented individuals as we have now. When that day comes, it will no longer be a dream for our cult to return to the Central Plains. This is merely a time for our cult to crouch, to build our strength. Do you understand?”\nAs he spoke these words, the Heavenly Demon knew a bitter truth.\nBy the time that day came, he would likely no longer be in this world. By his own estimation, he had less than ten years left, at best.\nBut the Heavenly Demon neither brought up those words nor showed any sign of it.\nBefitting the leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, the prosperity of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult took priority over his own remaining lifespan.\nThat was also the reason he was going through this song and dance of persuasion with his top brass. He was the Heavenly Demon, a god to his followers. He could just give the order, and they would have to obey without question.\nThe reason he handled things this way was to prepare for the possibility that his death might come sooner than expected.\nHe couldn’t risk this reformation stalling and dying with him. He needed them to understand, even just a little, how important this was.\n“Please, punish us for our foolishness!”\n\"We shall follow the will of the Supreme One!\"\nAs the senior members who had heard the Heavenly Demon's full explanation began to speak up one by one, the Heavenly Demon nodded once and gave his final command.\n“Good. Then you will all begin selecting candidates for the roles of instructor and escort. Furthermore, you will devise an efficient plan to fill the vacancies they will leave behind.”\n\"!?\"\nFor a moment, they all looked at him with pure shock.\n\"What are you all doing? Go back immediately and start your meetings. Or have you already come up with a brilliant idea?”\nThose gathered bowed without exception and left the Heavenly Demon Palace.\nOnce they were clear of the Heavenly Demon’s presence, they gathered again, and a heated debate erupted.\n“We’re already short-staffed trying to gather intelligence on the Nine Sects and One Union and the Murim Alliance. And you think it makes sense to pull even more people out?” the Head of the Dark Shadow Pavilion spat.\nThe newly appointed Head of the Sacred Order scowled.\n\"Didn't you hear what the Supreme One said? He said we are building our strength. If your ears can’t even hear the Supreme One’s words, might as well let me help you by cutting them off.”\nThe Dark Shadow Pavilion Master's face turned beet red. He glared daggers at the Head of the Sacred Order as if he would kill him.\n“And what about your Sacred Order? Isn’t it useless now? The Heavenly Demon himself said there are hardly any subversive elements left in Xinjiang. I’m sure you could spare one or two people from your division without much trouble.”\nThe division heads went at each other’s throats, desperately trying not to lose even a single subordinate.\n\"How about we just pull all the instructors from the Eight Trigrams Hall? Since they've been bragging so much about being smart, why don't we just have the Eight Trigrams Hall handle all the non-martial arts education?\" the Head of the Elder Council sneered, taking a shot at the department in charge of formations and spells.\n“And what about the old fossils in the Elder Council? They are all just wasting food and air. Let them be useful for a while. When they go senile, we can just ship them off to the Peach Blossom Ridge. I hear it’s much improved, so there’s nothing to worry about, right? Hahaha.”\nThe Eight Trigrams Hall Master, with veins bulging on his forehead, also sneered at the Head of Elder Council.\nA similar scene was playing out where the martial unit leaders and the Left and Right Protectors had gathered.\nThe only saving grace was that their superiors, the Protectors, were at least trying to mediate.\nAnd so, while the cult’s top brass was suffering daily migraines from the bomb the Heavenly Demon had dropped on them, he himself was getting a progress report from the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master.\n\"Heh heh heh.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon stroked his beard and let out a hearty laugh. It wasn’t just because his orders were being carried out swiftly.\nIt wasn't just because the matters he had instructed were being processed quickly.\nIt was because of his precious youngest disciple, Il-mok, the one who had thought of all this. He still didn’t know which bastards were scheming against Il-mok, but…\n“They’ve had it too easy for too long.”\nThe Heavenly Demon thought that they only had time to scheme because they had too much time on their hands.\n\"It might be better to keep them busy so they don’t have time for any funny ideas until Il-mok has fully matured. Hmm. It would be nice if that boy Il-mok could come up with another useful reform plan. Hehehe.”\nThe Hidden Guard Pavilion Master, who stood closest to the Heavenly Demon, maintained an expressionless face outwardly, but cold sweat ran down his back.\nIt wasn't because he was afraid of being swamped with work himself.\n“…There is a risk, my Lord, that this could backfire and unite the high-ranking officials in a plot to assassinate Young Master Il-mok.”\nHaving attended their meetings, the Pavilion Master knew. He knew that the men gathered there were grinding their teeth in frustration at Il-mok, the source of all their new troubles.\nThey were fanatical cultists who would follow the Heavenly Demon’s orders without question, but Il-mok was a different matter entirely.\nI shuddered from a sudden chill that came over me.\n‘Did the rampage weaken my body? Why am I getting the chills so often these days?’\nIt was strange.\nRight after I’d woken up, I hadn’t felt a single chill, even while being tortured by Master, that quack of a doctor, and Eldest Brother.\nBut ever since my job as a Wikipedia for education policy had ended and Eldest Brother had stopped visiting, the chills had become unsettlingly frequent.\n\"Are you alright, Young Master?\"\nI shrugged my shoulders once and answered. “Just a little chill, that’s all.” The source of this content ɪs novel※fire.net\n“…It’s possible that the cold energy from the White Hand Demonic Art is accumulating in your body. I will reduce the frequency of the treatments.”\nSince it seemed like a plausible reason, I nodded.\n\"That would probably be better.\"\nOuyang Mun, who had been watching from the side, spoke up.\n\"Then, Young Master, let me perform the treatments in Hayeon’s place. Hayeon must be tired after all her hard work. Doesn’t she deserve a little rest?”\nAs if to broadcast how helpful he was being, he shot Jin Hayeon a wink.\nAnd as usual, what he got in return was a look from her that said she’d just spotted something disgusting on the bottom of her shoe.\n‘God, this guy never gives up. You’d think he’d take the hint by now.’\nI was shaking my head at his pitiful one-sided crush when my Third Brother, who was also there, spoke up.\n\"Are you feeling dizzy?\"\nI almost nodded without realizing it.\n‘Yeah, it is, thanks to you people.’\nI had dreamed of a comfortable rest after Eldest Brother's visits stopped, but that dream didn't last long.\nBecause a cockroach-like existence by the name of Ouyang Mun exists.\n\"Since Third Young Master and Young Master Il-mok are having a conversation, how about we step away together for a moment?\"\nThen there was my Third Brother, Seo Wan-pyeong, who would tag along, supposedly to help Ouyang Mun with his love life, and just fill the room with his gloomy stories.\n\"I'm sorry I couldn't help you last time at Peach Blossom Ridge, and now with this incident too. I'm such a useless senior brother, always disappointing you.\"\nAnd then there was my Sixth Brother, Jong-ri Chu, who would also pop in from time to time to spout absolute nonsense.\n“Youngest, isn’t it tiring to always carry that old man on your back?”\nEspecially Jong-ri Chu. He was the rarest visitor, but never failed in giving Il-mok the worst headaches when he did come.\n'Has his Mad Soul Sword Art reached a higher level in the past six months? His getting more and more schizophrenic these days.’\nI made a mental note to avoid that guy like the plague after I graduated from the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nAnd as my shitty luck would have it, today all three of them had decided to visit me at the same time.\nHiding my desperate wish for them all to just fuck off, I tried to gently kick them out.\n\"Thank you all for coming despite being busy with your schedules. I’m quite healthy now, so please, feel free to return to your duties.”\n\"Young Master Il-mok is truly kind indeed.\"\n“Huhu. Do you think so too, Young Warrior Ouyang?”\n\"I think so too, Third Brother. My friend here, who’s been listening quietly, is nodding in agreement. It seems his tongue has been cut out, so he cannot speak.”\n\".......\"\nThis trio was so dense it was painful. Or maybe it was a quartet, if I included Sixth Brother’s invisible friend.\n‘…Wait. Don’t tell me that I’m getting these chills because of my Sixth Brother’s friends?’\nI started to miss the Hall of the Demonic Way more and more.",

    "content": "Chapter 122: Reform (8) Updates are released by NoveIꜰire.net\n\"Aren't you all quite busy?\"\nWhen I circled back to the topic, Third Brother replied with a gloomy smile.\n“What would we be busy with? Things won’t really get hectic for us until after the higher-ups finish their meetings.”\n\"The White Turtle Corps I belong to has also temporarily halted activities since our leader is attending the meeting, Young Master.\"\nThe answers from my Third Brother and Ouyang Mun just sparked another question.\n“What meetings are you talking about?”\n“What else? The meetings for that reform plan you devised, Youngest.”\n\"Yes. I heard the higher-ups have been constantly at each other’s throats over the personnel assignments, Young Master. Hahaha. You're truly remarkable. The best and brightest of the cult have been tearing their hair out for days trying to solve the problem you created, you know?\"\nOuyang Mun's praise made my head throb.\n‘So the reason these bastards are hanging around here day after day is also my fault?’\nThe unfairness of it all was getting to me. I had to change my way of thinking.\n‘Right. This isn’t my fault. This place was a psycho ward to begin with.’\nI want to smack my past self for thinking that getting shipped out of the Demonic Way via pretending to be sick would be a good idea.\nI had forgotten one important fact.\nIf the Hall of the Demonic Way was an asylum for prospective mental patients, then the headquarters was a pandemonium crawling with genuine lunatics.\nJust look at Sixth Brother over there.\nHe was staring blankly into empty space again when his eyes suddenly widened in shock.\n“What a brilliant idea!”\n\"...What are you talking about?\"\nHe answered my question. “As you know, brother, I don’t belong to any specific department yet. But since our Eldest Brother is so busy right now, that old man over there just suggested that I go and help him.”\n\"????\"\nThe place my Sixth Brother was pointing at was a blank wall.\nI felt another chill coming on, but I quickly forced my mouth to move.\n“That’s a truly wonderful idea, Sixth Brother. Master and Eldest Brother would surely be overjoyed to see their sons working together. Hahaha.”\nThis was my chance.\nA chance to kick out this patient and send him to Eldest Brother.\nOf course, given Sixth Senior Brother's condition, I wondered if he could actually work properly.\n‘But that’s not my problem.’\nI could just chalk it up as petty revenge against my First Brother for using me as a Wikipedia.\n\"They say you should strike while the iron is hot. Why don’t you go and speak to Eldest Brother right now, Sixth Brother?”\n“Your words ring true, Youngest.”\nSixth Brother nodded, mumbled something to the empty air, and then stood up and walked right out of the infirmary.\nMaybe because Sixth Brother left first, Third Brother also left not long after.\n\"Since the Third Young Master has left, don’t you think it’s about time you left too?”\n\"I'm fine, though?\"\n“I’m not.”\n\".......\"\nWith Jin Hayeon's blunt dismissal, Ouyang Mun finally left.\nThanks to the rare quiet moment, I lay down again to rest for a while.\nAfter a moment, a random question popped into my head and I mumbled it aloud.\n“It’s strange.”\n“What is, Young Master?”\n\"It's been over ten days since I came to the medical wing, yet Seol-ah hasn't come to visit while everyone else comes by almost daily.\"\nI hadn’t thought about it while being hounded by Master and Eldest Brother, but now that I did, I felt oddly disappointed.\nThey say kids grow up fast. Is this what it feels like to be a dad?’\nI wondered if her interest had already cooled after not seeing each other for just half a year.\nBut that seemed to be a misunderstanding.\n\"If you mean Young Lady Seol-ah... it appears the Hyeokryeon Family is controlling the information she receives.”\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\"According to rumors, Young Lady Seol-ah's achievements are developing at a rapid pace each day. They are likely cutting off outside information so as not to interfere with her training.”\n\"Hmm....\"\nThat sounded exactly like something the Hyeokryeon Family would do.\nNot that I had any intention of going to their place to raise hell about it. My body wasn't in good condition, and after dealing with all these psychos, all I wanted to do was rest.\n'I'll see her when I graduate from the Hall of the Demonic Way.'\nThough I had no idea how Seol-ah would react when she found out that I had been at the headquarters.\nNearly twenty days had passed since I was brought to the medical hall.\nAt first, even the slightest movement sent waves of pain through my body, but now I had recovered to the point where I barely felt any pain.\nSo, I boldly requested to be discharged.\n“I think it’s about time I returned to the Hall of the Demonic Way.”\n“Hmm. A few more days of rest wouldn’t hurt.”\n“There will be an exam at the Hall soon, Elder Demonic Physician. I should at least participate in that, don’t you think?”\n\"Hahaha. It can't be helped then.\"\nThe Demonic Physician readily accepted my model-student excuse. Of course, the real reason was that I was just sick and tired of dealing with all the crazies.\nBut I wasn't leaving the medical hall immediately.\n\"Elder Demonic Physician, how is the production of that disinfecting alcohol we talked about?”\n“We don’t have a large quantity yet, but just as you suggested, we are establishing a production system using the techniques for distilling spirits.”\n“In that case, could you perhaps spare a bottle for me?”\n\"For hand washing, as you mentioned last time?\"\n\"That's right.\"\nWhen I nodded eagerly with a desperate expression, the Demonic Physician pondered for a moment and stood up.\n“It was made thanks to you, Deputy Master. I suppose I should give you some.”\nAs he left the infirmary, he grumbled to himself, “We don’t even have enough for drinking and medicinal use. Tsk.”\n\".......\"\nHe seemed quite reluctant to part with the alcohol, but I pretended not to hear.\nThe Demonic Physician who had gone to get hand sanitizer didn't return for quite some time.\n'Good heavens, just how precious is this alcohol to him?'\nJust as my head was filling with such thoughts, the old man finally returned.\nHolding what looked like a liquor bottle in one hand, with a young physician beside him.\n“Sorry for the delay. Hehehe. Since you’re returning to the Hall anyway, I thought I’d bring that physician I mentioned last time.\"\nIt took me a second to remember what he was talking about.\n“You mean the physician for the Hall?”\n\"That's right. I agonized over who to send for a long time, but this fellow here actively volunteered. Hahaha.”\n\"Please take good care of me, Deputy Master!\"\nThe young man who bowed while clasping his hands in greeting was someone somewhat familiar to me.\n‘Wait a minute, isn’t this guy the one who suggested using narcotics to treat mental illness?’\nI remembered that I had to talk him down from that crazy idea, which naturally led to the suggestion of using narcotics solely for anesthesia. Was his name Seo Jae-pil?\n\"Ahem. I've already stepped down from the Deputy Master position, Physician Seo. That was only temporary anyway. I am now just a simple student of the Hall of the Demonic Way.”\n\"How could I call the Young Master who gave me countless medical inspirations just an ordinary student?\"\n“You will have to be in the Hall.”\n“Then I will address you that in public settings and as Young Master when we meet privately.”\nIt seemed pointless to argue, so I just accepted it. “Do as you wish.”\nNow that it was settled that I would be returning to the Hall with this young, crazy physician, Jin Hayeon spoke up.\n\"Then I shall report to the Heavenly Demon.\"\nShe left to inform Master of my departure.\nAnd after more than an hour had passed, she returned with Master.\n\"There was a meeting, so I'm a bit late. If we delay any further, the sun will set, so you should be on your way back to the Hall.”\nIt seemed he’d only come to see my face, because he gave a simple greeting and left almost immediately.\n\"Take care, Miss Jin.\"\n“I will see you again after you graduate from the Hall, Young Master.”\nAfter exchanging farewells with Jin Hayeon, I headed to the Hall of the Demonic Way together with Physician Seo Jae-pil and several martial artists who served as both guards and guides.\nPaying no attention to the martial artists accompanying us, Physician Seo chattered incessantly.\n\"I heard about it from Elder Demonic Physician. The turbulent period of youth, what a fascinating theory that was, Young Master. In fact, I volunteered for the Hall specifically to research that subject.”\n\"This time, I plan to study the condition of children who learned Demonic Arts from a young age at the Hall of the Demonic Way, then compare them to the children who will enter later under the new system, to see if their minds are truly unstable during that period.”\nSince it was a topic I had no interest in whatsoever, I just let it go in one ear and out the other.\n‘Is this guy obsessed with medicine? Why am I surrounded by nothing but psychos?’\nI shook my head and opened the bottle the Demonic Physician gave me and sprinkled the alcohol on my hands.\n'Ahhh.'\nThe refreshing sensation of the disinfectant alcohol evaporating through my hands soothed my mind.\nAround the time Il-mok was returning to the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nIn a corner of the Hyeokryeon Family estate.\nSwish!\nAs Hyeokryeon Seol-ah swung her arm, the wooden dolls touched by her fingertips were cut down one after another.\nIt was a strange sight. Her hand had merely brushed against them, yet the cuts were razor-sharp.\nShe hadn't formed her Claw Qi yet, but the tips of her nails were already stained red, and a crimson light flickered in her eyes.\nFor a mere thirteen-year-old girl, she emanated a menacing aura.\n\"Whew.\"\nFinishing her daily training, she let out a soft sigh and lifted her head.\n'I should go see Big Brother.'\nThe brother she was thinking of was the doll, carefully sealed away in a corner of her room. A doll so precious that no one was allowed to approach or touch it.\nHer daily ritual included thoroughly cleansing her body and mind with a bath before meeting her ‘brother,’ lest even a single drop of sweat touch him.\nOn her way from the training ground to bathe.\n“Did you hear? In a few years, the age for entering the Hall of the Demonic Way is going to be raised.”\n“You mean that? Isn’t that why the ban on Demonic Arts training was issued?”\nShe could hear the estate's martial artists chatting beyond the wall.\n'A ban on Demonic Arts training?'\nThe decree sounded completely out of place for the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, so she doesn’t think much of it.\nIt wasn't her concern, after all.\n\"Who would have thought that a few words uttered by the Eighth Young Master would bring about such great changes?\"\nBut the phrase \"Eighth Young Master\" that followed caught her steps.\n'As expected, Big Brother always accomplishes great things.'\nJust a moment ago, she’d had no interest in the matter, but now she suddenly thought it was a magnificent affair.\nBut that thought was quickly replaced by a question.\nTo seek the answer, she didn't hesitate to use her movement technique and leap over the wall.\n“Greetings, Young Lady Seol-ah.\"\nThe two warriors, startled by her sudden appearance atop the wall and saluted her.\nIgnoring their greeting, she questioned them like an inquisitor.\n“You’re saying new decrees were issued because of Big Brother Il-mok’s words?”\n\"That's correct, Young Lady.\"\nIt had happened before, so the two warriors reacted as if it were nothing special. But Hyeokryeon Seol-ah’s next question made them freeze.\n\"How strange. Big Brother is 'confined' at the Hall of the Demonic Way, so how could Big Brother's words cause changes at the headquarters?\"\n\"...They say he sent a letter to the Heavenly Demon through an instructor at the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\n\"Y-yes. That letter suddenly caused an uproar. Hahaha.\"\nThey quickly fabricated an excuse, but it didn’t work. Hyeokryeon Seol-ah hadn’t missed their momentary hesitation, and her intuition was screaming that they were hiding something.\n“If you don’t tell me the truth, I’ll slit my own throat.”\nAt the sight of her suddenly raising her sharp nails to her own neck, the two warriors panicked and had no choice but to tell her the truth.\nKnowing her side effects, they knew there was real danger she might take her own life if it involved the Eighth Young Master.\n'...What will happen if the Young Patriarch learns of this fact?'\n'This is getting more dangerous by the day.'\nThe two warriors thought of the Young Family Head of the Hyeokryeon Family—Hyeokryeon Seol-ah’s father—who was in seclusion.\nHe was such a doting fool that he’d spent all his time pampering his daughter instead of training. The Family Head, Hyeokryeon Cheongang, had finally forced him into seclusion over two years ago.\nAfter listening to the two warriors’ full explanation, Hyeokryeon Seol-ah’s eyes glowed red as she murmured, “You said the name of the man who hurt Big Brother was… Chu Il-hwan?”\nThe direction her turned gaze pointed toward was where the Pure Mind Hall was located.\nIn a certain hall of the Pure Mind Hall.\nChu Il-hwan was in a counseling session with one of the physicians.\n\"Then, when are the side effects of the Black Thunder Demonic Palm at their worst?”\n\"Hmm.... They tend to be the worst when I meet someone who piques my interest. The thought of seeing their blood, of how fun it would be to kill them… it just keeps popping into my head.”\nThe counseling was a pretext to manage the side effects of his art, but it was also a trap to catch a tail if Chu Il-hwan was indeed the mole they were looking for.\nAfter a few more questions and answers…\n\"Are you feeling unwell somewhere?\"\nA sudden chill ran through Chu Il-hwan, and he shivered violently.",

    "content": "Chapter 123: Clubs (1)\nAfter traveling for quite some time while ignoring Physician Seo's incessant chatter, we were able to reach the Hall of the Demonic Way without much difficulty.\nPhysician Seo and I entered the Hall of the Demonic Way through the main gate that an instructor had opened for us, then headed straight to the Hall Master's quarters.\n\"You've returned faster than expected, Disciple Il-mok.\"\n\"I'm not fully recovered yet, but I returned early for the upcoming exam.\"\nThe Hall Master’s face remained impassive as he gave a curt nod. He then turned his gaze to Physician Seo Jae-pil.\n\"Are you the physician from the Pure Mind Hall who will be handling counseling at the Demonic Way from now on?\"\n\"That's correct, Hall Master. My name is Seo Jae-pil.\"\n\"Good. I've already given instructions to prepare quarters for Physician Seo. Also, please start by scheduling counseling sessions with the instructors first.\"\n\"I will do so.\"\nAfter Physician Seo's response, the Hall Master nodded once, then spoke in an unusually quiet voice.\n\"Have you heard from the Demonic Physician about the other reason we brought a physician from the Pure Mind Hall to this place?\"\n\"Yes, Hall Master.\"\n“Be mindful of that matter during the counseling process.\"\nCooperating to catch any remaining spies who might still be lurking in the Hall of the Demonic Way, that was Physician Seo Jae-pil's second mission.\n‘Based on the previous incident and all that chattering on the way here, this guy’s head is filled with nothing but thoughts about medicine.’\nI had zero faith in the man. But I could hardly say that to the Hall Master with Councilor Seo standing right there.\n'Guess I’ll just have to keep an eye on him for a while.'\nAs the thought crossed my mind, I realized the Hall Master was looking at me again.\n“Disciple Il-mok, you should return to the Black Dragon Hall and get some rest. I’ll have an assistant show Physician Seo to his quarters.”\nSince I wanted to rest anyway, I bowed to the Hall Master with cupped fists and left the Hall Master's quarters.\nBut sadly, it was impossible to rest immediately at the Black Dragon Hall.\n\"Young Master Il-mok!\"\n“Hold it right there!”\nNearly ten people came rushing at me, surrounding me.\nTo be precise, they were divided into two factions.\nFive people formed one group led by Baek Cheon and Bang Mi-hwa, while three others—Dokgo Pae, Mak Ho-yeol, and Gwak Sul—formed another group, encircling me.\n‘Dammit. They’re back already?’\nThe sight of Baek Cheon and Mak Ho-yeol meant the upperclassmen who’d left for practical training a month ago were back.\nThe leaders of the two factions that had successfully surrounded me started buzzing excitedly. Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on novel fire.net\nBaek Cheon snapped open his fan with gleaming eyes.\n\"Young Master Il-mok! I trust a man of your caliber will see the wisdom in joining our Theater Club!”\nDokgo Pae immediately shot him down with a yell.\n\"Hmph! As if Young Master Il-mok would join a pointless club like that! Young Master Il-mok will naturally join our Bodybuilding Club!”\nSo, the club system I’d proposed was already up and running.\n'Theater Club is understandable enough, but what the hell is a Bodybuilding Club?'\nThe name alone made my stomach turn. Maybe it was my compulsive hygiene, but the mere thought of a sweaty club made my skin crawl.\nTotally ignoring my visible disgust, the two of them started arguing over me as if I weren’t even there.\n“Spoken like someone from a family of brutes. I see not an ounce of culture or tradition in you.”\n\"What a petty thought, typical of someone from the Baek family. A true man needs a powerful, weighty presence.”\nThough both were from the Five Great Demonic Families, the Dokgo Family had joined the Demonic Cult several decades later than the Baek Family.\nOf course, since both had joined before the Cult was driven from the central plains, they were, in my book, a classic example of the pot calling the kettle black.\n'If we're talking about culture and tradition, the An Family has them all beat.'\nThe An Family was unique among the five as they are famous for their sorceries rather than martial arts, and they had the longest history.\nI recalled Jin Hayeon telling me that the head of the An Family had assisted the Lord in rituals since the Cult’s earliest days.\n\"Shall we settle this today?\"\n“Heh. A pup that doesn’t fear a tiger. You really are a Dokgo moron.”\nWhile my mind drifted, Dokgo Pae and Baek Cheon, apparently forgetting their original purpose, finally drew their weapons.\nThinking this was my chance to slip away...\n\"Calm down, Vice President Dokgo! The decision belongs to Young Master Il-mok!\"\nUnfortunately, Gwak Sul’s shout ruined my escape, and every eye in the place snapped back to me.\nIt was a strange feeling. They were all looking at me, but each gaze was different.\nPeople like Baek Cheon, Bang Mi-hwa, Dokgo Pae, and Ju Seo-yeon all stared with this strange, unwavering certainty, as if my joining their club was a foregone conclusion.\nWhile I could understand the three from the Theater Club, I had no idea why Dokgo Pae and his crew had such confidence.\n'Both the club name and its members reek of sweat, why would I?'\nGwak Sul, on the other hand, looked at me with what seemed like faint resentment tinged with hostility.\nI couldn't figure out why he harbored ill feelings toward me. Maybe I was just seeing things wrong.\nThe others, like Ha Young and Mak Ho-yeol, just looked hopeful.\nAnd then there was Jeong Hyeon, standing by herself off to the side, her eyes so desperate they were practically glistening.\n'Geez... What happened while I was gone to make her look so desperate?'\nIt was a pitiful sight, almost enough to make me feel sorry for her.\nAlmost.\n\"I'm sorry, but I won't be joining either club.\"\nI already had a different club in mind that I wanted to join.\nI’d had a club in mind since the moment I first pitched the idea to my Master and the Hall Master.\nMore precisely, it was a club I was about to create.\n\"That's not possible.\"\nA rare look of bewilderment crossed Il-mok’s face at Instructor Eun Ryeo’s flat refusal. Since Chu Il-hwan’s dismissal, Eun Ryeo had been recognized for her experience and appointed as the Head Instructor for the new students. She answered while deliberately maintaining a cold expression.\n“There are two primary reasons, Disciple Il-mok.”\n“I’m listening.”\n“First, I am already in charge of the Theater Club. You should know well since you proposed this, that one instructor cannot be in charge of multiple clubs.\"\n\"...You're in charge of the Theater Club, Instructor?\"\nHis tone made it clear he found the pairing absurd, and Instructor Eun Ryeo had to grit her teeth.\n'It's because of you!!'\nOf course, she had zero interest in theater whatsoever, and she does not know theater either.\nNevertheless, the reason she ended up in charge of the Theater Club was because of Jeong Hyeon. The sight of the girl, so lost and alone after Il-mok was carted off due to Chu Il-hwan’s rampage, had struck her to the core. Unable to look away, she’d been swayed by her own arts and volunteered.\n'Right. When Disciple Il-mok returns, he can sort this mess out!'\nThis was Instructor Eun Ryeo's true thoughts. She’d naturally assumed he’d join the Theater Club upon his return.\nBut what is this?\n'Why is he trying to create a new club?!'\nHe’d already reeled in four young women. What is this about?\n'Don't tell me he's already gotten bored with them!? '\nEun Ryeo had heard such stories before.\nThere were often people who no longer felt attraction to members of the opposite sex who had fallen for their charms.\nAnd society commonly called such men 'playboys.'\nAs a fellow woman, she scorned them, and her expression grew colder.\nOf course, Il-mok was completely unaware of Instructor Eun Ryeo's inner thoughts.\n\"Then, besides you, Instructor, are there other people...\"\n\"Instructor Cheok Il-so is in charge of the Bodybuilding Club, and Instructor Jeong Gyu-seok is in charge of the Doctrine Research Club. As I understand it, all the upperclassmen instructors are also spoken for.”\nEven before he voiced his question, Instructor Eun Ryeo answered while radiating coldness.\nInstructor Cheok Il-so was the instructor in charge of external martial arts education, and Instructor Jeong Gyu-seok was the instructor in charge of doctrine education.\nRegarding the Bodybuilding Club, Dokgo Pae and Mak Ho-yeol originally had no intention of creating such a club.\nThe problem was the regulation that prohibited practicing Demonic Arts during club activities, since the purpose of clubs was mental and physical stability.\nWhen Dokgo Pae and Mak Ho-yeol were at a loss due to this fact, Instructor Cheok Il-so had proposed a club dedicated purely to physical training.\nGwak Sul was just collateral damage, dragged in against his will. At least those instructors were advising clubs that suited them.\nUnlike Instructor Eun Ryeo.\nSensing the unusual chill, Il-mok hesitated before asking, “Is there really no one left?”\nEun Ryeo was about to answer \"That's right,\" but she caught herself. There was one person. No matter how much she disliked Il-mok, as an instructor, she couldn’t lie.\n\"Sigh. There is a newly appointed instructor who isn't in charge of a club yet. However, clubs require a minimum of three people to be established. And this is the second reason why establishing a new club is impossible, Disciple Il-mok.\"\nThis wasn't a regulation she made up to obstruct Il-mok. Since the number of instructors was considerably smaller compared to the number of students, clubs for just one or two people were prohibited.\nIl-mok thought about this for a moment, then nodded before asking a strange question.\n\"By any chance, can people who have already joined clubs transfer to other clubs?\"\n\"...That's possible, but...\"\nAt her answer, Il-mok gave her a quick salute and left the office.\nWatching the spot where Il-mok had left, Eun Ryeo soon had an ominous thought.\n'...He couldn't be planning to seduce other women to join, could he?'\nAfter he met with Instructor Eun Ryeo, he made a beeline for the Black Dragon Hall.\nAfter thoroughly searching the Black Dragon Hall, he was able to find his targets.\n\"There you are!\"\nWhen Il-mok approached with a bright smile, the usual three stooges—Choi Woong, Seong Hwan, and Mun Gyu—felt their eyes tremble with inexplicable dread.\nIt was a fear they had learned the hard way.\n\"Wh-what can we do for you, Young Master Il-mok?\"\n\"Were you looking for us?\"\nIl-mok nodded with a bright smile at Mun Gyu’s question\n\"I came to find you today because I have a favor to ask.\"\nIl-mok was grinning from ear to ear, but for some reason his right hand was gripping his sword hilt.\nThe next day.\nIl-mok and the trio of stooges headed to an instructor's office together.\nBut it wasn't Instructor Eun Ryeo's office.\nMa Do-yeong, the man newly selected as an instructor at the Hall of the Demonic Way after Chu Il-hwan's dismissal, received the letter Il-mok handed him.\n“You want me to be the advisor for a new club?”\n\"That's correct, Instructor.\"\nAt Il-mok's confident answer, he looked at the trio behind Il-mok with a dubious look.\nIn stark contrast to Il-mok’s bright demeanor, they looked like they were being led to the gallows.\nConfused, Ma Do-yeong looked back down at the paper Il-mok had given him.\n\"...Meditation Club?\"\n\"That's correct.\"\nIl-mok again answered with a vigorous tone.\nThe club Il-mok had thought of from the beginning for a peaceful life at the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nIt was a napping club called Meditation.",

    "content": "Chapter 124: Clubs (2)\nAfter finishing the establishment of the Meditation Club, Il-mok headed straight to the Black Dragon Hall to rest.\nAs for the trio he’d strong-armed into joining, they parted ways with him and wandered off.\nJust as the once-quiet clearing had served as Il-mok's hideout, the trio also had a place where they usually spent time together.\nThey were heading there to vent their frustrations about being forcibly enrolled in the Meditation Club by Il-mok, but soon tilted their heads in confusion.\nThere was already someone there.\n\"Gwak Sul?\"\n“What are you doing here?”\nIt was Gwak Sul, the poor guy who’d been stuck as Dokgo Pae’s sidekick for nearly two months.\nAt their questions, Gwak Sul cracked a conspiratorial smile.\n\"I was waiting for you all.\"\n\"???\"\n\"For us?\"\nIgnoring their bafflement, Gwak Sul brought up an unexpected topic.\n“You know the sixth test is tomorrow, right?”\n“Yeah, so?”\n\"Then, how about joining forces with us for tomorrow's test?\"\n\"Join forces?\"\n\"The teams haven't even been announced yet, so what's the point of forming teams in advance?\"\n“If we move out of the groups, the instructors mark us with poor evaluations.”\nAs they shot down his weird proposal, the corners of Gwak Sul’s mouth pulled into a wide grin.\nHowever, his eyes weren't smiling at all.\n“Forget about grades. That’s not what this is about. Don’t you want revenge?”\n\"Revenge? What revenge?\"\n\"On Young Master Il-mok.\"\n\"!!!\"\nWhile the trio wore shocked expressions, Gwak Sul laid out the bait.\n“I heard what happened. He dragged you off and forced you into his weird club, right? Don’t you want a little payback?”\nThe trio’s eyes shifted nervously.\n'Damn it.'\n'Okay, we started it, but he went too far this time.'\n'Yeah. Just this once…'\nIt wasn't enough that he used them as human shields to block the instructors' view during training sessions, and now he’d forced them into his club.\nEven if they had been the ones to pick a fight from day one, they felt this was a bit much.\nStill, they hesitated.\n\"Don't you know Young Master Il-mok's skills?\"\n“You really think we can get him, even together?”\nIt had been a full six months since the three of them had jumped him and failed miserably. They’d gotten better since then, but Il-mok’s skills had shot up to a whole other level.\nGwak Sul nodded as if he understood completely.\n\"It wouldn't be easy with just the four of us. However, this time Dokgo Pae will also join us.\"\n\"Dokgo Pae?\"\n“The wild boar who does nothing but charge at Young Master Il-mok by himself? It's hard to believe that Dokgo Pae would participate in a group attack.\"\n“Don’t worry about that. I managed to convince him.”\nIn truth, his “convincing” hadn't been anything special.\nHe’d just hit Dokgo Pae with a hard truth: fighting alone will only result in him losing again without being able to even exchange a few moves.\nAnd he had deceived him by saying that the group attack was merely a foundation for the future.\nThen, he had pitched the team attack as a stepping stone for the future. He’d spun some twisted logic about how they could use the team fight to memorize Il-mok’s techniques, then build up their own skills to fight him one-on-one later.\nEven a blockhead like Dokgo Pae sensed something was off.\n— Didn’t you tell me that you would leave all the thinking to me?\nAfter dealing with Dokgo Pae for two months, Gwak Sul had developed a spine of steel and pushed ahead forcefully.\nAnd that resolute attitude he had shown to Dokgo Pae was now being displayed toward the trio without reservation.\n\"Of course, even with Dokgo Pae joining us, there’s no guarantee that five of us can take down Gwando Il-mok. But…”\nGwak Sul paused, and the trio’s gazes were fixed on his face.\nWith their attention drawn, he finished his sentence with a smirk.\n“If you keep holding back just because you’re not certain, you’ll spend the rest of your lives getting pushed around.”\nInstantly, the image of being pushed around by Il-mok until graduation from the Hall of the Demonic Way appeared in the trio's minds.\n“Ugh.”\n\"We'll... join you.\"\nThe trio thought this was their only opportunity, but soon a question arose in Mun Gyu's mind.\n“But setting us aside, Gwak Sul, why are you targeting Young Master Il-mok?\"\nIt would make sense if he were targeting Dokgo Pae instead.\nMun Gyu wisely swallowed the second half of that thought.\nGwak Sul answered with another smile.\n\"I, too, am doing this for revenge.\"\nWhat revenge? The question swirled in the trio's heads, but they couldn't bring themselves to ask.\nUnlike his smiling mouth, his eyes were completely filled with poison and resentment.\n'If it weren’t for Young Master Il-mok!!'\nFor over two months, he had been tormented by two crazy boars who had no interest in anything but sparring and training.\nIt had been more than enough time for him to cultivate a deep-seated grudge against Il-mok, the root cause of all his suffering.\nNever mind that Il-mok had only told Dokgo Pae to ‘use his head,’ not to go torture Gwak Sul.\nBut to Gwak Sul, that didn't matter.\nTo Gwak Sul, that was an irrelevant detail.\nHis tormentor, Dokgo Pae, was routinely thrashed by Il-mok in every exam and spar anyway, so that was satisfying enough. But what really got to him was seeing the root of all his suffering get off scot-free.\nSo he’d decided to team up with his own bully to take down their common enemy. It helped that they shared the same target.\nThe side effect of Gwak Sul’s Demonic Art was supposed to be an anxiety disorder, but months of torment had warped it into a textbook case of Stockholm syndrome.\nA short walk through the woods later…\n\"Damn it.\"\nA curse slipped from my lips.\n\"I did return early using the test as an excuse, but I didn't know the test would be the very next day.\"\nI didn't even get to enjoy the club time I'd been looking forward to, thanks to the exam being scheduled for the day after its founding.\nHonestly, the last thing I wanted to do was draw my sword.\nBecause the side effect felt like it was spring-loaded, ready to pop at any second.\n'I am not some rapid response team.'\nThe thought dredged up unpleasant memories of his military service from his past life as Seo Ji-hoon.\nBack in the infirmary, the slightest poke from his Master or his Eldest Brother was enough to get his mouth running. He couldn’t even guess how crazy he’d get if he drew his sword.\nThe only good news was that this exam was an individual combat.\nHe walked along the mountain path, telling himself he was just out for a stroll.\nStrangely, no other cadets appeared around him.\nJust as he was starting to feel puzzled…\n\"Huh.\"\nA cadet spotted him first from the distant bushes and immediately bolted away in the opposite direction at full speed.\nOnly then could he understand the situation.\n'They're reacting like they've just seen a tiger in the mountains.'\nAll the students were avoiding him.\nWhen he thought about it, it made sense. The skill gap between him and the others was huge, so of course they’d want to face him as late as possible.\n'This works for me.'\nSince he was already worried about the side effects of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, he decided not to chase after them.\nInstead, he found a nice, shady spot.\n\"Hmm.\"\nThe idea of sitting his butt on the ground felt a little unclean, so he took out a piece of cloth he’d brought just in case and spread it on the ground.\nThen, after sitting cross-legged on it.\n“Good thing I brought this, too.”\nHe took out a flask he’d packed and poured some of the liquid into his hand.\nThe cool sensation of the disinfectant alcohol evaporating from his hands and its smell cleansed his mind.\nWhile Il-mok was leisurely enjoying his meditation, elsewhere…\nBang!\nA fierce battle was raging far away from him.\nBang Mi-hwa’s clothes were dirty and her hair was a mess, but she still managed to cover the lower half of her face with her fan. “I never thought you’d resort to such cheap tactics, Dokgo Pae!”\nWhile Dokgo Pae's face reddened at her outcry, Gwak Sul opened his mouth instead.\n\"Aren’t you also with Disciple Ha? Seems like the pot calling the kettle black to me.\"\nShe had been working together with Ha Young as usual, even though it was individual combat. But she never imagined five people would form a group to hunt them down.\n\"Vice President Dokgo. Our main target is still Young Master Il-mok. These are just obstacles in our path, so please finish this quickly.\"\nDokgo Pae, who had entrusted all the thinking to him, nodded once and raised his great sword.\n\"Let's have a proper duel next time. For now, just give up, Bang Mi-hwa.”\n\"Haaah.\"\nHow long had he been resting leisurely in the shade?\n“Things have probably settled by now, right?\"\nIl-mok, who had muttered to himself, got up and looked at the cloth he had been sitting on and crushing with his buttocks.\n'Should I take this with me?'\nAfter pondering for a moment, he picked up the cloth with his fingertips and carefully tied it to his outer robe, making sure it wouldn't touch his skin.\nHe then cleansed his hands with another splash of rubbing alcohol before setting off at a leisurely pace, tracking the signs of battle through the mountain. It wasn't long before he found them.\n“You’ve got to be kidding me.”\nNo sooner had the words left Il-mok’s mouth than five figures burst from the surrounding bushes, surrounding him.\n\"Since when did the test become a group activity?\"\nTo Il-mok's question, Gwak Sul opened his mouth again.\n\"Given your skill, Young Master, it’s natural that we would team up against you. You know what they say: the nail that sticks out gets hammered down.”\nWhile Il-mok let out a hollow laugh at that bold answer.\nThe trio, who quickly exchanged glances with Gwak Sul, nodded.\nSwoosh!\nSimultaneously, they occupied three directions and charged at Il-mok.\nThey attacked from three sides at once. Choi Woong came at Il-mok from the front with his saber, Seong Hwan jabbed with his spear from the left to limit Il-mok’s movements, and Mun Gyu charged at his back.\n'Whew.'\nTaking a deep breath, Il-mok drew his sword in a flash.\nClang!\nIt was an incredible feat. With a single swing, he simultaneously parried the saber and spear from the front and left, while also deflecting Mun Gyu’s advance from behind.\nBut just as the trio was pushed back, as if waiting for that very moment, Dokgo Pae charged in, swinging his greatsword.\nClang!\nDokgo Pae and the trio alternately swung their weapons in coordinated attacks, and whenever the movements of the four became clumsy or misaligned, Gwak Sul moved at the right time to act as a lubricant.\nThanks to Gwak Sul’s clever spear work, their five-man team attack flowed with surprising synergy. After holding them off for a short while, Il-mok’s expression began to darken.\n\"Shut up!\"\n\"!?\"\nThe five of them stared in confusion at his sudden outburst.\n\"Keep pressing the attack!\"\nWith Gwak Sul's urgent command, the other four snapped out of it and renewed their assault.\nBeads of sweat were already flowing down Il-mok's forehead as he blocked their offensive.\nIt wasn't because their coordinated attack was too fierce. And the shout to shut up from earlier hadn't been directed at those five either.\n— Too slow.\n— If you’re going to swing a sword like that, why not just let me take over?\n— I’ll show you what real swordsmanship looks like. Heh heh heh.\nIl-mok couldn't properly concentrate on the fight because he was battling another self from the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword that kept spouting nonsense in his brain.\nSeeing Il-mok sweating and struggling to block and evade, the faces of the trio lit up.\n'Now's our chance!'\n'The coordinated attack is working!'\n'Finally, revenge!!'\nA smile had also crept onto the lips of Gwak Sul, who was orchestrating the entire battle. An opportunity to land a blow on the formidable Young Master Il-mok.\n'Who would have known that commanding people could be so much fun?'\nHe found this situation extremely enjoyable.\nAmong them, only Dokgo Pae wore a somewhat sullen expression.\nThus, the five—no, six, including the other self—continued their coordinated attack, pushing Il-mok back for a while.\nClang!\nRight after Il-mok blocked Seong Hwan's spear.\n\"Haaah!\"\nDokgo Pae’s greatsword came flying in as if to slice Il-mok in two.\nIl-mok scrambled backward, but he was a split second too late.\nThe greatsword didn't hit him.\nBoom!!!\nThe greatsword that he barely dodged struck the ground, kicking up a cloud of dirt that splattered all over Il-mok’s body and clothes.\nAs Gwak Sul, Choi Woong, and Mun Gyu charged toward Il-mok in succession.\n\".......\"\nFor some reason, Il-mok just stood there, staring blankly at the dirt staining his body.\nThinking this was their chance, the trio swung their weapons at Il-mok.\nClang!!\nWith a strange metallic ring, their weapons were all deflected.\nIt was bizarre. They hadn't even seen his sword move, yet their weapons were knocked away, leaving shimmering silver trails in the air.\nAs the three of them stumbled back from the monstrous technique…\n\"Hehehe.\"\nA cold smile had replaced the flustered look on Il-mok’s face.\n\"Ah. This cool and heavy sensation. It's been truly a long time.\"\nIl-mok, who muttered while looking down at the sword in his right hand, raised his head and swept his gaze over the five surrounding him.\n“It has been an age of humiliation and persecution. I was sick of it, so for that, I thank you.”\nWith those words, Il-mok's other self swung the sword.\nOr rather, the five of them saw no swing at all.\nThe process was gone, and their vision was filled only with the result: the mesmerizing, silver arcs.\nAs they stared, transfixed by the dazzling trails that contained countless enlightenments, Choi Woong, Seong Hwan, and Mun Gyu all had very similar thoughts.

    "content": "Chapter 125: Clubs (3)\nThat evening, after the exam, in a pavilion at the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nFollowing Il-mok's reform proposal for the Hall of the Demonic Way, the place that came to be called the \"Medical Office (醫務室)\" was where Il-mok and Physician Seo Jae-pil were conducting a consultation.\n\"Your Demonic Arts went berserk?\"\nIl-mok nodded with a sour look on his face at the physician’s question.\n'Why does he look so happy about this?'\nWhile one was dead serious about it, the other one had the look of observing a fascinating new lab rat.\n“Could you tell me what happened in detail?”\nDespite his misgivings, Il-mok sighed and decided to talk.\n'I might switch councilors later, but for now, he’s all I’ve got.'\nSince there was no alternative for the time being, Il-mok gave up and opened his mouth.\nThe incident where he was ganged up on by five people: Dokgo Pae, Gwak Sul, Choi Woong, Seong Hwan, and Mun Gyu.\nAnd how he went berserk right after dirt got on his body and clothes.\n“Luckily, I managed to wrestle it back down at the last second, so no major harm was done.”\nIt had been dangerously close.\nThe Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, in its quest to draw a ‘perfect sword path,’ had been aiming for their necks, hearts, and vital points. He had only regained control at the last possible moment, twisting the blade just enough to beat them with the flat of it instead.\n\"Indeed... You received rubbing alcohol from the Demonic Physician to wash your hands, and now this. It seems that in addition to your obsession with perfect swordsmanship, you also suffer from a rather severe case of cleanliness obsession.”\nDespite his lab-rat-gazing eyes, Physician Seo Jae-pil responded to the consultation with sincere dedication, diligently scribbling all the details of his consultation with Il-mok.\nHe even added, “While not identical to your side effects, there was a case where a patient gradually learned to manage their condition by exposing themselves to situations they disliked little by little.”\nHe immediately shared his treatment approach as well.\n“Would you hold out your left hand for a moment?”\nIl-mok did as he was told, and the physician dipped a brush in ink and let a single drop fall onto the back of his hand.\n\"!!!\"\nWhen Il-mok shot him a glare, the physician asked with a relaxed expression.\n“Do you feel like you’re about to lose control now?”\n“…I desperately want to wash it off, but no, I don’t think I’ll lose my mind over it.”\n“In that case, let’s try to endure it for a count of ten today.”\nFollowing his instructions, Il-mok forced himself to look away from his hand, gritting his teeth against the obsessive urge.\n\"Eight. Nine. Ten.\"\nAnd as soon as Physician Seo Jae-pil finished counting to ten, Il-mok immediately poured water on his hand to wash off the ink, and then doused it with alcohol for good measure.\n\"Well done. This tea has been confirmed to have a calming effect on the mind and body. For now, please drink a little of this.”\n\"Whew.\"\nWith a deep sigh, Il-mok took a sip of the tea and focused on his breathing, trying to quiet the Demonic Art that kept threatening to rear its head.\nOnce Il-mok’s breathing seemed to stabilize, Physician Seo spoke again.\n\"When did the side effects become serious?\"\nThe consultation continued for quite a while.\n'...Still, I guess a physician is a physician.'\nAlthough he couldn't trust a man who was so obsessed with medicine, he was starting to realize that, conversely, it made him entirely trustworthy when it came to medicine and counseling.\nWhile he couldn’t be sure if the exposure therapy would work, just talking about his side effects had already eased some of the tightness in his chest.\n'Indeed, the Hall of the Demonic Way really needed a physician.'\nIl-mok himself could serve as proof of that.\nHis rapid progress in the last six months had caused his side effects to worsen dramatically. If he had been able to visit the Pure Mind Hall as he had at the main headquarters, he probably wouldn't have been driven to this state.\nOf course, setting aside his medical skills, he still didn't trust Physician Seo one bit.\nWhile Il-mok was observing him with mixed feelings, the physician finished organizing all the consultation content and looked up at Il-mok again.\nWhile Il-mok was observing him with mixed feelings. Given Young Master's symptoms, I believe it will be of great help in managing your side effects. However, will you be alright?”\nIt was a bit of a random question, but Il-mok easily grasped his meaning.\n“You mean the instructor in charge?”\n\"That's right. According to Elder Demonic Physician, there's a high possibility that the newly selected supervisor is connected to the forces targeting Young Master.\"\nIl-mok nodded. He was already aware of the problem.\n\"There were two main reasons. One was, as Physician Seo said, to manage the side effects.\"\nUnlike others, Il-mok felt it might be okay to reveal half his true feelings to Seo Jae-pil, who was a physician.\nIf he’d revealed this to one of the Demonic-Art-addled old-timers, he would only hear insane talk about weak willpower or insufficient faith, but Physician Seo Jae-pil was different.\nOf course, the whole truth was a little different.\n'Even without side effects, the club would still be a meditation club.'\nSide effects or not, Il-mok’s favorite activity was doing absolutely nothing.\n“And the second reason was to make myself bait. As the old saying goes, keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.”\n\".......\"\nPhysician Seo Jae-pil showed a surprised expression at Il-mok's words.\n'Is this really a surprising thing? Wait… is it because I, his test subject, am in danger?\nIl-mok had pegged Seo Jae-pil as some kind of mad scientist, but the councilor’s next words completely blindsided him.\n“Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer? Was there such an old saying? I've never heard such words before. To think you know a proverb I have never heard. You are a man of profound knowledge.”\n\"...Ahem. It, it was something I picked up somewhere.\"\nIl-mok coughed and tried to manage his expression.\n'Damn. Wasn't that an Eastern proverb?'\nHe had almost gotten himself labeled a lunatic or drawn some very strange suspicion.\nWhile Il-mok was reminding himself to be more careful with his words, Physician Seo’s expression turned worried again.\n“I understand your intent, but isn’t it dangerous?”\n\"Considering what has happened so far, they won't be able to move easily either. It seems they’re trying to operate without leaving any evidence.”\n\"You mean they won't target Young Master in situations where they might arouse suspicion?\"\n\"That's right. If something unfortunate were to happen to me during club hours, the instructor in charge would be the prime suspect, wouldn’t he? Plus, I’ve secured three witnesses, so I should be relatively safe.”\nThe three witnesses were, of course, Choi Woong, Seong Hwan, and Mun Gyu.\nWhile he had brought them in to fill the numbers needed to establish the club, Il-mok would have dragged them in even if he could have started the club by himself.\n“It’s a relief to know you’ve thought that far ahead. However, if they feel cornered, they might resort to a desperate gamble.”\n\"...I'm aware of that.\"\n\"And you still chose to take on such a dangerous bait role?\"\n\"Whew.\"\nIl-mok sighed.\nGiven Il-mok's safety-oriented nature, a bait role was absolutely not a choice he would make.\n\"This is also something I'm doing because of this guy.\"\nSaying that, Il-mok pointed to his own head with his right index finger.\nThere might be people within the Hall of the Demonic Way who wanted to kill him.\nThe thought had been circling his mind ever since he returned, making it hard to do anything properly out of sheer anxiety. So, after a lengthy debate with his side effect, he had come up with the idea of reverse-baiting.\nWhile he couldn't deal with misfortune that might come at any time, if he kept a suspected enemy close and under observation, he’d at least have a fighting chance.\nSeeing Il-mok point to his head and call it \"this guy,\" Seo Jae-pil's eyes lit up as he picked up his brush again.\n\"Could you tell me about this in detail? You truly are a magnificent test subject… I mean, a source of medical inspiration for me.”\n\".......\"\nIl-mok was convinced.\n'This bastard. He’s not worried about me. He’s just upset he might lose his favorite lab subject.’\nWhile Il-mok was spending time in the medical office.\nA meeting was underway in the Vice Hall Master’s chamber with the new instructor, Ma Do-yeong. The official purpose was for Vice Hall Master Yu Geuk, who had been covering Chu Il-hwan’s classes for the past twenty days, to hand over the duties for the students Ma Do-yeong would be teaching.\nUnder that pretext, they were having a frank conversation.\n\"Lie low for a while?\"\n“Those were his orders. Our repeated failures have put us at risk of being discovered by the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons.”\nYu Geuk frowned.\n“So, we’re just supposed to let the Young Master graduate without incident?”\nAt Yu Geuk's question, Ma Do-yeong made a subtle expression.\n\"You mustn't misinterpret his will. Lying low for a while means exactly that. It means to wait at least until the Supreme One’s surveillance has lessened.”\n\"The Young Master has only a year and a half left until graduation. What if the surveillance remains tight until then?”\n\"Then it can't be helped.\"\nA corner of Yu Geuk’s mouth quirked up at Ma Do-yeong’s nonchalant tone.\n\"If that happens, neither you nor I will have results. Now that you're stuck in this tedious place called the Hall of the Demonic Way, the chance for you to climb up might as well be none.\"\nAt Yu Geuk's point, Ma Do-yeong smiled faintly and answered.\n“Now that I am here in the Hall, under the Supreme One’s intense scrutiny, I can no longer communicate with him. And in a state of war, when communication with the top is impossible or in an emergency, is it not the most basic of principles to act first and report later?”\nThis time, both corners of Yu Geuk’s lips curled up in interest.\n\"Acting first and reporting later.\"\n“Getting rid of Instructor Chu was also done without a report, was it not?”\nYu Geuk had no intention of denying it with pointless word games and nodded freely.\n\"So, do you have a plan in mind?\"\n“Not at the moment. But one thing is certain. We must seize an opportunity that will leave absolutely no evidence. In that sense, Vice Hall Master, I find myself in a rather advantageous position.”\n\"...You mean becoming the advisor of the Young Master's club?\"\n\"That's right.\"\nAt Ma Do-yeong's confident answer, Yu Geuk nodded.\n\"Good. Keep a close watch and look for an opportunity.\"\nThe next day.\nAfter all the usual meetings and counseling with the instructors as usual, Il-mok headed not to the usual training ground he had always gone to, but to a certain hall.\nTogether with the trio of Choi Woong, Seong Hwan, and Mun Gyu.\nThe three of them looked like they were being led to the slaughterhouse as they followed him into the clubroom.\n\"Please take care of us, Instructor!\"\nUnlike the miserable trio, Il-mok, looking perfectly happy, greeted the instructor, sat down, and closed his eyes.\n“ Haaaaaah. Hooooo. ”\nAs Il-mok began to take deep, deliberate breaths, the trio, after some awkward hesitation, followed his lead and sat down to meditate.\nHe wasn’t circulating his energy or anything. He was just sitting there with his eyes closed, breathing in and out. Seeing this, Ma Do-yeong nearly let out a snort of derision.\n'He’s completely defenseless.' Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on novel✦fire.net\nIt felt pathetic that they had consecutively failed to kill this careless fool.\n'Right now, I could end it with just one swing of my hand.'\nThe thought was painfully tempting. If only these three losers weren’t here.\nIf only leaving no evidence wasn’t a requirement. This mission would have been over long ago.\n'Kill? Or not?'\nSeeing his prey so unguarded, a murderous impulse kept flaring up in Ma Do-yeong’s heart.\nJust then…\n“ Zzzzzzz. ”\nIl-mok started to doze off, even snoring. Veins bulged red on Ma Do-yeong's forehead.\n'Damn it! I could kill him right now with a flick of my finger!’\nHe felt like he was about to fall into Qi Deviation if he kept watching his defenseless prey.\nMeanwhile.\n'Shit.'\n'Why did we have to be dragged to a place like this?'\n'For the love of god, read the room, Young Master Il-mok!!'\nCaught between their snoring leader and the fuming instructor who was glaring daggers at him, the trio felt their mouths go dry.",

    "content": "Chapter 126: The Devilish Man (1)\nAround the time Il-mok was indulging in a deep afternoon nap, club activities were in full, chaotic swing all across the Hall of the Demonic Way.\n\"Hahahaha!\"\n\"Ohohohoh!\"\nFrom their usual clearing, the booming laughter of Baek Cheon and Bang Mi-hwa echoed out, all under the flimsy pretext of “vocalization practice” for the Theater Club.\n\"Haah...\"\n\"Haah...\"\nStanding a few steps away were the Instructor-Disciple pair, Jeong Hyeon and Eun Ryeo, who sighed in perfect, weary unison as they watched the duo.\nWhile they were busy with their theatrics, other clubs were just as active. In one corner of the main training grounds, a group of cadets was grunting and heaving lumps of iron as part of the so-called Bodybuilding Club. Among them, one man’s face was twisted in a look of profound discomfort.\n\"Disciple Dokgo, if your muscles are bothering you, it might be better to rest for a day rather than push yourself through training.\"\nHearing Instructor Cheok Il-so, who was in charge of the Bodybuilding Club, Dokgo Pae shook his head.\n\"My body's fine, Instructor.\"\n\"Hmm. Then something must be weighing on your mind. Rather than brooding alone, why don't you open up to this instructor and tell me what's bothering you!\"\nCheok Il-so flexed his pectorals as if to prove his reliability.\nTrue to the club’s name, they were all training their muscles with their shirts off, the better to examine each other's physiques in detail.\nIt was precisely the kind of sight that would have made Il-mok recoil in disgust and turn on his heel.\nSpurred on by his instructor's impressive display, Dokgo Pae made up his mind and opened his mouth.\n\"Actually, what happened during the last exam has been bothering me.\"\n\"The last exam?\"\n“Yes. The matter of me ganging up on Disciple Il-mok. It was an act unbefitting a warrior of the Divine Cult.”\nThough he had been swayed by Gwak Sul's smooth talk to participate, Dokgo Pae still felt uneasy about it.\nAnd that uneasiness was only getting thicker and stickier with each passing day.\n\"I told myself it was to observe Disciple Il-mok's martial arts more closely and improve my own skills, but looking back, it was a cowardly act, Instructor.”\nHearing his student’s lament, Cheok Il-so threw his head back and roared with laughter. His magnificently sculpted torso rippled with amusement.\n“Hahaha! Is that all? You’re worried about something so simple! If it’s bothering you, just be a man and go apologize! Ah, but wait! A simple verbal apology might seem insincere. How about this?”\n\"???\"\n\"Disciple Il-mok joined that weird Meditation Club thing, so you should show him some goodwill.”\n“Goodwill? What kind of goodwill?\"\n“Hahaha! I’ll let you share one of the secret muscle-building techniques I taught you boys—one of the ones I withheld from the official external arts curriculum. For the sake of my prized student, Dokgo Pae, I’m willing to look the other way, just this once.”\n\"!!!\"\nDokgo Pae looked at Cheok Il-so with a moved expression.\n\"This Dokgo Pae is deeply moved by your generosity, Instructor!\"\n\"Hahahaha! Of course! Plus, if Young Master Il-mok is impressed by that secret technique you share, he might even transfer to our club, talk about killing two birds with one stone!\"\n\"As expected of you, Instructor!\"\nAs Cheok Il-so burst into hearty laughter again, Dokgo Pae joined in, and even Mak Ho-yeol, who had been listening from the side, was roaring right along with them.\nWatching the trio enthusiastically flexing their muscles while laughing, Gwak Sul, who was off to the side lifting the lightest weight, sighed internally.\n'Is that really something to lose sleep over?’\nHell, they had five people ganging up on him and still lost in the end, so the hell would you apologize for that? Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs NovєlFіre.net\nHe’d been dealing with these guys for two months, but he just couldn’t wrap his head around their way of thinking.\nAnd it wasn’t just Dokgo Pae that he couldn’t understand.\n\"But, Instructor, do you really think Disciple Il-mok would want to learn a bodybuilding technique?”\nTo Gwak Sul, all three of them, who seemed absolutely certain that Il-mok would be moved to tears, were completely out of their minds. But…\n\"Hahaha! What are you talking about, Gwak Sul!\"\n\"Of course! Look at Young Master Il-mok’s realm; he must have trained his body with great diligence.\"\n\"Instructor Cheok and Brother Dokgo are right! Junior Il-mok would surely be delighted!\"\n\"Hahahaha!\"\n\"Uhahahaha!\"\nFaced with their utter lack of doubt, Gwak Sul clamped his mouth shut. A sudden urge to crack open their skulls and study their brains surfaced, but he quickly dismissed it.\n'Their brains are probably made of muscle too.'\nIt was painfully obvious without even looking. He just shook his head and went back to his weights.\nAfter enjoying a refreshing nap that lasted the entire ninety-minute club session, Il-mok was making his way back to the Black Dragon Pavilion when...\n\"Young Master Il-mok!!\"\nAn unwelcome voice made Il-mok’s face crumple in annoyance.\nOf all people, it had to be Dokgo Pae.\n‘Fuck. If I draw my sword right now, I think I’ll actually lose it.’\nHe had a terrible premonition that this lunatic would somehow manage to provoke him into doing just that.\nBut surprisingly, Dokgo Pae, who had rushed over, immediately bowed his head and cupped his hands in respect.\n\"I'm sorry about what happened last time.\"\n\"???\"\nSeeing Il-mok's puzzled expression, Dokgo Pae elaborated.\n“Ganging up on you like that… it was unmanly. I know I disappointed you. I have no excuse.”\nIl-mok made a peculiar expression.\nSure, his mood had been utter shit that day because of his Demonic Art threatening to overwhelm him, but he didn’t hold any particular grudge against the guys who had attacked him.\nHe would've done the same thing in that exam if he were in their shoes.\nStill, he had to admit, having the guy come and apologize of his own free will wasn’t unpleasant.\nHe was about to accept the apology when Dokgo Pae suddenly said something out of left field.\n\"So, as an apology, I'll share something good with you, Young Master.\"\n\"Something good?\"\nIl-mok looked at Dokgo Pae with a curious but wary expression.\n\"An excellent muscle training method I learned from Instructor Cheok Il-so!\"\n\"...\"\nA heavy sigh escaped Il-mok’s lips.\n'I'm the idiot for getting my hopes up.'\nIt was exactly the kind of thinking you'd expect from a martial arts fanatic.\n“I don’t need it.”\nFaced with Il-mok’s blunt refusal, Dokgo Pae fell into thought.\n'This method is truly a good thing, but I can't explain it with words!'\nHe realized that with his poor eloquence, he couldn't properly explain the advantages of that training method.\nLost in thought, he decided to change his approach, thanks to some advice he'd heard from Gwak Sul.\nWhen he’d asked for tips on how to use his head, Gwak Sul had told him that when you’re stuck, you have to change your perspective on the problem.\n‘That’s it! If words won’t work, I’ll just have to show him! A brilliant man like Young Master Il-mok will surely understand the sincerity of my actions!’\nHaving made up his mind, Dokgo Pae suddenly grabbed his martial arts uniform with his hands and...\nRIIIIP!\nHe tore off his upper garment with pure force.\nThe violent motion made the muscles of his chest and arms throb and pulse as if they might burst.\nFlex.\nTaking a pose that showed off his muscles, Dokgo Pae asked with a confident face, \"See? Isn't it magnificent?\"\n\"...\"\n\"This is all thanks to that training method. So, won’t you join me in this endeavor, Young Master?”\nThe pulsating muscles and the sweat drops that made those muscles stand out even more caught Il-mok's attention.\nCut off all those disgusting muscles!\nHis mysophobia began to shriek in protest.\nThe following morning, Il-mok headed to the training grounds for the daily martial arts session.\n'He was pretty well-behaved yesterday, wasn't he?'\nHe was thinking of Ma Do-yeong, the man who had replaced the disgraced Chu Il-hwan as the martial arts instructor and who also happened to be his Meditation Club advisor. During yesterday's club time, Ma Do-yeong had just watched him nap quietly.\nOf course, just because he'd been well-behaved for one day didn't mean he should drop his guard, that would be foolish.\n'Wonder what he'll pull today.'\nWhile Il-mok was thinking about Ma Do-yeong, an unpleasant call came from behind.\n\"Young Master Il-mok!\"\nTurning his head at Dokgo Pae's call, Il-mok's face crumpled mercilessly.\nHe had no idea why that crazy bastard was clinging to him like this.\n'It's not like he's some phone salesman or cult member... oh wait, he IS a cult member. Damn it.'\nHe felt like he'd finally realized the root of all his problems.\nBut realizing the root cause didn't mean there was a solution.\nThe leader of that goddamn cult was his own master after all.\nThey say a problem without a solution is the greatest source of stress. Feeling like he'd hit a dead end, Il-mok let out a deep sigh.\n'Should I just cut him down and get it over with?'\nAs Il-mok's right hand twitched toward his sword hilt, Dokgo Pae, who had closed the distance, asked in confusion.\n\"What's wrong with you? Didn't I say I'd share something good with you as an apology!\"\n“…I don’t need it.”\n\"Just trust me a little! Even Gwak Sul over there has learned so much and changed greatly since joining us!”\nFollowing where Dokgo Pae was pointing, Il-mok could see Gwak Sul enter the training ground.\nJust as Jeong Hyeon had moved up to the Upper Class after the third exam, Gwak Sul had also moved up to the Upper Class after the sixth exam.\nHe’d earned good scores by teaming up with Dokgo Pae during the previous exams, and his skills had improved drastically thanks to the nonstop harassment from Dokgo Pae and Mak Ho-yeol.\nAnd seeing Dokgo Pae pointing at him, Gwak Sul approached them like a Stockholm syndrome victim.\n“You called for me, Vice President Dokgo?”\nVice President of the Bodybuilding Club, or Vice President Dokgo for short, nodded and said, “Young Master Il-mok here doesn’t seem to believe me. Tell him how much you’ve improved since joining us!”\nIl-mok, who had been listening to their conversation, looked at Gwak Sul with an expression brimming with pity.\n'He must be suffering quite a bit.'\nPerhaps sensing the sympathy in Il-mok’s gaze, Gwak Sul spoke in an annoyed tone.\n\"This is all because of Young Master Il-mok.\"\n\"...What do you mean, because of me?\"\n“I heard you gave Vice President Dokgo some advice. And because of that advice, he came looking for me, didn’t he?”\nGwak Sul, who was suffering through a hardship because of Il-mok, couldn't stand seeing the very cause of his troubles showing him sympathy.\nOf course, from Il-mok's perspective, it was absolutely absurd.\n'Advice I gave him? Wait, from before? When I told him to use his brain a little?'\nSeriously, all he did was advise the guy to use his brain a little, and now he was getting blamed for this?\nIt was beyond unfair; it was downright ridiculous.\nHe'd never even mentioned Gwak Sul while giving that advice.\nJust as Il-mok was about to argue back in his bewilderment, someone's internal energy-infused shout echoed through the training hall.\n\"QUIET!\"\nIt was Ma Do-yeong, the martial arts instructor and Il-mok’s club advisor.\n\"It's time now, so stop the chatter and focus on your training.\"\nAt his command, the Upper Class students each took their positions around the training ground and began practicing their martial arts.\nDokgo Pae also quickly dragged Gwak Sul away and started swinging his sword, while Bang Mi-hwa took her usual spot with Ha Young.\nJeong Hyeon had also taken a spot off by himself and was shooting arrows.\n\"Phew.\"\nWith a deep sigh, Il-mok set up his usual human wall with the three stooges and began to lazily swing his sword.\nMeanwhile.\nAs the students began their individual training, the new instructor, Ma Do-yeong, started to circle the grounds, observing them.\n\"You're putting in too much force. Relax your wrist strength at the end and focus a bit more on your internal energy.\"\n“Don’t hesitate. Instead of forcing the flow, entrust your body to the rhythm of the form, and it will unfold much more naturally.”\nIt was clear he hadn’t been chosen as the martial arts instructor for nothing.\nAs he continued around the training hall offering guidance, he eventually arrived near Il-mok and his trio.\nSince all four were members of the Meditation Club he was in charge of, they were already familiar faces.\nAnd Ma Do-yeong could easily see through the human barrier to spot Il-mok in the center, half-heartedly swinging his sword around.\nA vein popped on Ma Do-yeong’s forehead as he began to stare at Il-mok like he wanted to burn a hole through him. Cold sweat dripped down the foreheads of the three stooges surrounding Il-mok.\n'Please!!'\n'Seriously, the instructor is right there in front of us…'\n'What the hell did we ever do to you to deserve this?!'",

    "content": "Chapter 127: The Devilish Man (2)\nThe three stooges were intimately familiar with Il-mok’s laziness thanks to the months they’d spent acting as his human shield.\nBut come on, even he should show some restraint when the instructor was glaring at him like he wanted to murder him on the spot, right?\nAt this point, it felt less like laziness and more like a deliberate provocation.\nMa Do-yeong finally snapped and opened his mouth first.\n\"Disciple Il-mok.\"\n\"Yes, Instructor.\"\nWhen Ma Do-yeong called out to him, Il-mok let his arm drop from its half-hearted sword swinging and answered with an innocent face.\nHis expression screamed I have absolutely no idea why you're calling me.\nWith another vein bulging on his forehead, Ma Do-yeong spoke up. “This is a martial arts training session, is it not?”\n\"I'm aware of that, Instructor.\"\n\"...What you’re doing looks less like martial arts to me and more like a toddler’s dance routine.”\nMa Do-yeong just couldn’t wrap his head around it.\nWhy was that person so dead set on killing this lazy, pathetic excuse for a cult member?\nWhy couldn't the guys who'd previously targeted this young master deal with one seemingly brain-dead idiot and avoid causing all this trouble?\nIn response to the instructor’s murderous glare, the pathetic fool in question answered with a bright smile. “That’s a misunderstanding, Instructor.”\n\"Misunderstanding?\"\n\"That's right, Instructor. I was simply practicing my forms as slowly and gently as possible to correct my form. Haha. They say fundamentals are important, you know?\"\nThat kind of training method did actually exist. But...\n‘That's supposed to be practiced with disciplined, slow movements to correct your form, not flopping around like a goddamn fish!’\nMa Do-yeong nearly roared at the youngest young master's smooth bullshit.\nPutting aside their relationship between target and assassin, even just as an instructor and a student, this was an unacceptable level of bullshit.\n\"I had no idea you had such lofty intentions. In that case, it seems this instructor must step in to aid your progress.”\nWith that, Ma Do-yeong drew his weapon.\n“I will personally guide you with a sparring match. You three, step aside for a moment.”\nFollowing the instructor's order, the trio who'd been nervously watching for their chance quickly backed away.\nThe sudden, impromptu duel between an instructor and a student drew the attention of every other member of the Upper Class.\nAs all eyes fell on him, Il-mok had only one thought.\n‘Why is this crazy instructor so hell-bent on picking a fight with me?’\nEven Chu Il-hwan, who used to struggle with murderous impulses, hadn't hassled him this persistently.\nIl-mok had no idea that Chu Il-hwan had known what he was doing but found it amusing enough to let it slide, so he couldn't make sense of Ma Do-yeong's behavior at all.\n\"Come at me first.\"\nSeeing Ma Do-yeong's stern expression as he spoke with his sword drawn, Il-mok began to suspect.\n‘I knew it! This bastard's definitely one of their rats!’\nOf course, it was just a hunch for now, too flimsy to report to the Hall Master. Besides that, Il-mok had his own internal enemy to worry about.\n‘If I fight the instructor now, I'll end up going berserk like during the last exam. Wait! Is he trying to trigger my rampage and then \"accidentally\" kill me while trying to stop it?’\nAs Il-mok stood there lost in thought, Ma Do-yeong finally lost his patience.\n\"If you won't come to me, then I'll come to you!\"\nWith that declaration, Ma Do-yeong charged. In that split second of crisis, Il-mok’s mind raced.\nSwoosh!\nAs Ma Do-yeong's sword, filled with powerful energy, flew toward Il-mok as if to cut him in half, Il-mok quickly swung his own sword.\nAnd the moment their two swords clashed...\nCLANG!\n\"Ugh.\"\nIl-mok let out a slight groan and stepped back, his right arm that had met the sword now raised high in the air. What's more...\nTing, ting, ting…\nClink.\nThe sword Il-mok had been holding went flying and was now rolling around on the ground.\nFor a swordsman, dropping one's weapon was the ultimate humiliation.\n\"That was truly a masterful move, Instructor. Thanks to you, I feel like I've gained great insight today.\"\nWhen Il-mok immediately acknowledged defeat with a bow after losing his sword in just one exchange, Ma Do-yeong's face turned even redder.\n“Are you toying with me right now?”\n\"What do you mean, Instructor?\"\n\"You think I don't know you deliberately dropped your sword?\"\n\"You're misunderstanding, Instructor. How could a mere student like me possibly withstand the full power of an instructor?\"\nHearing Il-mok's slippery response, something in Ma Do-yeong’s head snapped.\n“Fine! We’ll see this through to the end! Pick up your sword, now!”\n\"It's really a misunderstanding, Instructor.\"\n\"You think those lies will work on me? If you won't pick up your sword, I'll make you pick it up!\"\nJust as Ma Do-yeong was about to charge at Il-mok again, Il-mok beat him to it and shouted.\n\"This is unfair! And this is unjust treatment! How can you, Instructor, single me out for sparring when ten other students are here?\"\nIl-mok had expected this from the start, and just as he'd predicted, one stupid fish immediately took the bait.\n\"That's right, Instructor! Why are you giving special treatment only to Young Master Il-mok? Please give me a chance too!\"\nIt was the fish who was crazy for sparring and training: Dokgo Pae.\nStarting with Dokgo Pae, then Bang Mi-hwa, and finally all the other the Upper Class, the martial arts training time ended anticlimactically after everyone got their turn to spar.\nIn the end, Ma Do-yeong had to finish the lesson without being able to take out his frustrations on Il-mok.\nAbout an hour later, around lunchtime, Ma Do-yeong was summoned to the Vice Hall Master's quarters.\n\"...If you keep calling me this often, won't the Hall Master notice?\"\nWhen Ma Do-yeong asked with a puzzled expression, Yu Geuk wore a strange look.\n\"Don't worry, there's justification for it. More importantly, how's the surveillance of the Eighth Young Master going?\"\nJust thinking about Il-mok made veins pop on Ma Do-yeong's forehead, but he forced a relaxed smile and answered, “Honestly, he’s such a pathetic whelp that just watching him makes me feel secondhand embarrassment. I can't understand why no one has managed to dispose of such a pathetic guy until now.\"\n\"Pathetic, you say...\"\nFor some reason, even though Ma Do-yeong's assessment could be seen as a thinly veiled jab at Yu Geuk for his failed missions, Yu Geuk was actually smiling.\nIt was a blatant sneer.\n\"Instructor Ma. Do you look in the mirror often?\"\n\"The mirror?\" Ma Do-yeong asked back, looking as if he’d been asked a completely random question.\nYu Geuk maintained his sneer.\n\"I told you to observe the Eighth Young Master, but you ended up giving me an assessment of yourself.\"\n\"...Are you saying I'm pathetic?\"\n“Oh? Good. At least you have enough brains to understand that much.\"\n\"I think you're going too far.\"\nThe sneer on Yu Geuk's face deepened.\n\"The youngest young master is pathetic, you say? Then, are you suggesting that a pathetic boy managed to gain so much influence within the Cult at such a young age, an ordinary boy? And while all the other instructors who've dealt with the young master have praised his excellence, he only looks pathetic to you? You must have some special third eye that others don't have.\"\nThis was true.\nAll the reports from instructors were filled with praise for Il-mok's talent and wisdom. There was only one negative assessment: his weakness for women.\nEven the report from the now-dismissed Chu Il-hwan was the same. By the time Chu Il-hwan had realized Il-mok’s true nature, he was already under the Hall Master’s orders to secretly monitor him, so he couldn’t submit a negative evaluation.\n\"Doesn’t it strike you as odd when a person who appears to be a model student to every instructor acts pathetically only in front of you? Like, say, he's already suspicious of you?\"\n\"......\"\nMa Do-yeong was struck speechless.\nLooking at the silent Ma Do-yeong, Yu Geuk brought up something seemingly out of nowhere.\n“A moment ago, you said you were worried about arousing the Hall Master’s suspicion?”\n\"...That's right.\"\n\"Do you know why I called you here despite that? Because rumors have already spread. Rumors that you are being led around by the nose by your students.”\n\"!?\"\nThe look of genuine shock on Ma Do-yeong’s face made Yu Geuk do more than just sneer; he shook his head in disappointment.\n“I heard that during the morning’s martial arts session, you were completely manipulated by the words of Cadet Il-mok and the other Upper Class students.” ᴛhis chapter is ᴜpdated by novᴇlfire.net\n\"I wasn't pushed around, I was just...\"\n\"Tsk. How many eyes and ears do you think there are in this cramped Hall of the Demonic Way to see and hear your words and actions, and how many mouths there are to tell me about it? And if I've already heard about it, do you think the Hall Master hasn't?\"\n\"......\"\nSeeing Ma Do-yeong fall silent again, Yu Geuk clicked his tongue.\n\"Tsk. Setting aside the matter of handling the Young Master, you can’t even handle your job as an instructor properly. I don't know what that person was thinking when they sent you.\"\nEven in the face of such a humiliating verbal lashing, Ma Do-yeong couldn’t find the words to respond.\nAs a new instructor, he'd underestimated the difficulty of dealing with kids struggling with puberty and the side effects of Demonic Arts.\nAfter getting thoroughly chewed out by Vice Hall Master Yu Geuk, Ma Do-yeong remained in a daze for hours. He finally pulled himself together as evening approached.\nIt was time for club activities.\n‘I need to get my head on straight.’\nHe couldn't afford another evaluation like that.\nSteeling his resolve, Ma Do-yeong arrived at the Meditation Club’s building. Soon after, Il-mok and his three stooges entered.\n“We’re in your care, Instructor!”\nIl-mok greeted him with a bow and a bright smile as if nothing had happened, then immediately plopped down and entered meditation.\nOr rather…\n\" Snore. Snooore. \"\nHe was instantly fast asleep, snoring loudly.\nThe sight of Il-mok so blatantly dozing off made a familiar vein start throbbing on Ma Do-yeong’s forehead.\n‘Alright. He’s practically begging me to kill him.’\nOf course, if he killed him outright now, his evaluation would hit rock bottom even if the mission succeeded.\nBut...\n‘Fine. Before I kill this bastard, I need to play my role as an instructor properly so I don't arouse suspicion.’\nHe needed to act like an instructor.\n\"Disciple Il-mok.\"\nMa Do-yeong’s voice, still unable to fully conceal his emotions, was tinged with a faint killing intent.\nHowever, to Il-mok, who had been exposed to the Heavenly Demon’s heavy presence and killing intent multiple times, such weak killing intent didn't even register in his brain.\nThe ones who were suffering were the other three.\n‘Please!’\n‘Wake up, Young Master Il-mok!’\n‘Save us!’\nThe three stooges were trembling as they pretended to meditate, their eyes squeezed shut as they nervously monitored the situation.\nWhen Il-mok didn't wake up, Ma Do-yeong infused his voice with internal energy and shouted, \"DISCIPLE IL-MOK!\"\nIl-mok finally snapped his eyes open and looked at Ma Do-yeong with sleepy eyes.\n\"Wh-what's wrong, Instructor?\"\n\"Disciple Il-mok. This is meditation time, not a nap session.\"\nIl-mok wiped the drool from his lips and chin with the back of his hand and answered, \"Haha. A nap? I was meditating, Instructor.\"\nThe slick response made Ma Do-yeong squeeze his eyes shut.\nOh, Heavenly Demon, give me strength...\nHe felt like he might actually go berserk from Qi Deviation at this rate.\nFrom then on, the war of nerves between assassin and target continued.\n\"Disciple Il-mok.\"\n\"I'm not sleeping, Instructor.\"\n“Wipe the drool off your mouth and chin before you lie to me.”\nWhen Ma Do-yeong pointed out, Il-mok wiped the drool with the back of his hand and answered innocently, \"Hm? I guess I was a bit hungry.\"\n\"......\"\nWhile Ma Do-yeong took deep breaths to suppress the Heart Demon that kept rearing its ugly head, Il-mok was getting pissed off in his own right.\n‘Why is this guy keeping picking a fight with me since this morning?’\nOthers might see it as laziness, but napping was a serious matter for Il-mok.\nThanks to his recent, unwelcome surge of enlightenment, controlling the side effects of his arts was becoming increasingly difficult.\nHis claim that meditation and naps were to stabilize his mind and body wasn't just an empty excuse.\nWell, okay, he would have enjoyed meditating and napping even without the side effects, but there was no need to reflect on himself that deeply.\nAll that mattered was that this damn instructor who wouldn't let him sleep was pissing him off.\n‘I really think he’s trying to provoke me into a rampage…’\nAs his frustration mounted, his suspicions about Ma Do-yeong naturally deepened—a completely subjective suspicion with no regard for objectivity.\n‘The problem is, I need to find evidence that even that old geezer Hall Master would accept... Since I'm pretty sure this guy is the culprit anyway, should I just set a trap and frame him?’\nIl-mok was starting to resemble the bullies he'd often seen in the modern world’s dramas more and more.",

    "content": "Chapter 128: The Devilish Man (3)\nAfter club activities wrapped up for the day.\nSlurp.\nIl-mok stopped by the infirmary where Physician Seo was stationed, sipping on some tea that was supposed to calm his nerves.\n\"Phew.\"\nHe let out a light sigh as the warm liquid went down.\nSeo Jae-pil, who'd been watching him with sparkling eyes, leaned in. \"Did you manage to pick up anything useful?\"\nIl-mok nodded at his question.\n“I think the new instructor is suspicious.”\n“Hmm. May I ask why?”\n“Unlike the other instructors, he’s far too interested in me. To a blatant degree.”\nSeo Jae-pil nodded at Il-mok's observation.\n“I see. If you felt that way, then there’s likely something to it. However, isn’t it a bit strange?”\n\"What do you mean?\"\n“No matter how you look at it, wouldn’t it be incredibly foolish to be so obvious?”\nIl-mok nodded at Seo Jae-pil's point.\nHe'd been thinking the same thing to some extent.\n“Considering their methods so far, it does feel a bit off. That’s why I haven’t reported it to the Hall Master yet.”\nThe man’s constant attempts to provoke him into a rampage were infuriating, but Il-mok still had enough rationality left to separate his personal feelings from the facts.\n'The whole \"stab first, questions later\" approach is pretty risky right now.'\nPart of him just wanted to set a trap and frame the bastard since he found him irritating.\nBut that would be a terrible move for several reasons.\nIt would basically announce to his enemies that he was using himself as bait.\nPlus, if the bastards got spooked and went into hiding, he'd lose his chance to root them out completely.\n'There are people targeting me, and I can't just let this end without dealing with them properly. That would be way too unsatisfying.'\nIf that happened, his other self—that crazy perfectionist with severe OCD—might really start having meltdowns every single day.\nSeeing Il-mok lost in thought about how to handle Ma Do-yeong's situation, Seo Jae-pil spoke up.\n“As it happens, I began the counseling sessions with the instructors today. I’ve already met with the Hall Master, the Vice Hall Master, and a few others. So would you mind waiting just a bit longer?\"\n“You’re planning to probe Instructor Ma Do-yeong during his session?”\nSeo Jae-pil nodded.\n“Asking about you directly would only raise suspicion. Instead, I plan to hold several sessions and casually ask about their thoughts on the students in general. And this won’t be limited to just Instructor Ma Do-yeong.”\n“That makes sense. Besides Ma Do-yeong, there could be other rats. It would be risky to focus only on him.”\n\"Exactly, Young Master.\"\nLooking at Seo Jae-pil, whose eyes were practically gleaming as he stared at him, Il-mok nodded with an uncomfortable expression.\n'His skills as a physician seem solid, but the guy's completely unhinged. I really can’t bring myself to trust him completely.'\nBut since there wasn't anyone else to replace Physician Seo right now, he decided to trust him for the time being.\n“Alright, I’ll leave it in your hands.”\n\"Yes, Young Master. Oh, and since you're here anyway, would you mind telling me about what's been happening lately or any emotional changes you've experienced? If I record them, they could serve as excellent research material in the future.”\nSeo Jae-pil was basically saying that Il-mok was his test subject.\nWith a faint sigh, Il-mok recounted the events and emotional shifts of the past two days. Seo Jae-pil listened with an absolutely delighted expression and jotted everything down.\nIl-mok stood up to leave. “Ah, one more thing. Are you allowed to send a message to headquarters?\"\n\"I regularly exchange communications with the Pure Mind Hall.\"\nThe Hall of the Demonic Way was mostly made up of instructors, assistant instructors, and disciples, but they couldn't run the place with just those people.\nThey needed cooks, people to transport ingredients, and others to clean the dorms and do laundry for the students who were focused on training. The instructors and assistants typically used these channels to communicate with the headquarters and only made direct trips to headquarters when they had specific business.\nMeanwhile, the disciples were banned from any contact under the excuse that they should focus solely on training, which was pretty fucking bizarre, but it was a familiar system to Il-mok.\n'Basic training in the military was exactly the same.'\nYou got one letter to send to your parents at the very beginning, and after that, you only earned a phone call as a reward for exceptional performance. And even then, it was for what, a minute?\n'If a medieval cult of psychopaths operates at the same level as modern military training, which one's the weird one here?'\nIl-mok was internally concluding that both were equally fucked up when Seo Jae-pil asked, \"Do you have some important message to send to headquarters?\"\nNormally, disciples were forbidden from contacting the outside world, but given the circumstances, Il-mok could communicate through Physician Seo.\nAnd Il-mok nodded with a serious expression.\n\"I need to send a message to Elder Demonic Physician.\"\n\"What should I tell him?\"\n\"Tell him to send some hand sanitizer.\"\n\"......\"\nThe sheer gravity with which Il-mok delivered the line left Seo Jae-pil, for once, momentarily speechless.\nSeo Jae-pil barely managed to collect himself and asked in a dubious tone, “You… you’ve used it all already?”\n'It hasn't even been ten days since you got back from headquarters...’\nHe swallowed those words and waited for Il-mok's response, who shook his head.\n\"There's still some left, but it takes time for the message to arrive and for Elder Demonic Physician to send the sanitizer, no? I’ll feel more at ease if I receive it before I run out completely.”\nTrue to someone suffering from OCD, Il-mok was trying to prevent the worst-case scenario.\nPhysician Seo made an \"I see!\" expression of understanding and nodded.\n\"I'll take care of it.\"\nAfter Il-mok left the infirmary with Seo Jae-pil's confirmation, Seo Jae-pil picked up his brush.\nBut he wasn’t writing a message to Demonic Physician.\n—The Eighth Young Master didn't seem to realize it himself, but his compulsive tendencies had seeped into his daily life. The fact that he was worrying about running out of sanitizer first, even when his life was in danger...\nAs his brush flew across the page, Seo Jae-pil thought to himself, Indeed, the Young Master is a truly magnificent research specimen.\nThe next day, while the disciples were busy getting their asses kicked by the instructors during training, Seo Jae-pil was conducting interviews with the instructors in turns.\n\"Nice to meet you. I'm Physician Seo Jae-pil from the Pure Mind Hall.\"\n\"I'm Eun Ryeo, an instructor at the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\nSince classes here were divided into Upper and Lower Classes, two instructors taught simultaneously while the other two rested. He conducted counseling sessions during these breaks.\n\"Hmm. So your side effect is excessive sympathy. That must make it difficult for you to refuse others’ requests.”\n\"...That's correct.\"\nEun Ryeo nodded while feeling a strange mix of emotions as Seo Jae-pil saw right through her.\nIt was a weird feeling . A wariness and relief hit her at the same time.\nAs if sensing her turmoil, Seo Jae-pil smiled gently.\n“This counseling is standard procedure. It has already been conducted throughout the headquarters. Even the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons has received it, as have the heads of every division, so please, do not worry.”\n\"...I understand.\"\nKnowing that even the Heavenly Demon, their object of worship, had received this counseling made her feel a bit more at ease.\nThey continued to chat for a while over tea meant to calm the mind.\n\"Teaching young students must present difficult moments because of your side effects, Instructor Eun Ryeo. How do you handle it?\"\n“…Because of that issue, I make a conscious effort to appear cold on the outside, paying close attention to my expression and tone of voice.”\nAs they discussed her condition and coping mechanisms, the topic of Jeong Hyeon naturally came up.\n\"Oh my. I plan to counsel the students after I have finished with the instructors. I will be sure to pay extra attention to Disciple Jeong Hyeon.”\n\"Thank you, Physician Seo.\"\nNow that they were talking about disciples, Seo Jae-pil saw his chance and decided to probe a bit.\n\"So, besides Disciple Jeong Hyeon, are there any other disciples you're concerned about?\"\nAnd amazingly, Eun Ryeo took the bait immediately.\n\"If I had to think of someone, it would be Disciple Il-mok.\"\n\"Hmm. Isn't Disciple Il-mok famous for being a genius?\"\n\"Sigh... There's no doubt about his talent, but there's one disappointing thing.\"\n\"If you don't mind me asking, what would that disappointment be? You don't have to tell me if it makes you uncomfortable.\"\nEun Ryeo hesitated for a moment but soon spoke up.\nAfter all, the fact that Il-mok was a womanizer was common knowledge among the instructors. It had been reported to the Hall Master and had likely even reached the ears of the Heavenly Demon. Read full story at novelFirｅ.net\nShe didn't like gossiping about a disciple's personal life as an instructor, but if it was already widely known, she figured it couldn't hurt.\n\"It's natural for a young man to be interested in women, but Disciple Il-mok seems a bit excessive about it. What’s more, it pains my heart to see the already fragile Disciple Jeong Hyeon get caught up in it and struggle so much recently.”\nThis was, of course, fascinating news to Seo Jae-pil, who had heard absolutely nothing about Il-mok’s womanizing ways.\nAfter the thirty counseling sessions ended and Eun Ryeo left, Seo Jae-pil continued his interviews with the other instructors.\nWith Jeong Gyu-seok, the doctrine instructor:\n\"Is there anything that's been bothering you lately?\"\n\"Honestly, I was pretty upset about the Meditation Club being formed recently. Three disciples left our doctrine research club to join that new club!\"\n“Hmm. That sounds like a perfectly valid reason to be upset.”\n\"Ah, don't misunderstand. It's not that I'm upset about losing the disciples. It's just that if the goal is mental stability, doctrine research would be way more effective than meditation, so I'm wondering why they even bothered creating a meditation club.\"\nThey also discussed how the trio that had originally been in the doctrine research club had switched to the meditation club because of Il-mok.\nNext was Cheok Il-so, the external arts instructor.\n“Hahaha! If you’re asking who’s been on my mind lately, it would have to be the cadets from the Bodybuilding Club. Mak Ho-yeol, Dokgo Pae, and Gwak Sul! We’re kindred spirits, so I can’t help but keep an eye on them!”\n\"Having disciples who get along well with you must be really heartwarming to watch.\"\n“You have no idea! Actually, all of them are quite interested in Disciple Il-mok, so I've been keeping an eye on him too. If possible, I'd love to get Disciple Il-mok to join our Bodybuilding Club as well.\"\nThe conversation was mostly about the Bodybuilding Club.\nA few days later, Il-mok visited the infirmary for a follow-up counseling session and to pick up the hand sanitizer he’d requested.\nTaking the sanitizer bottle that Seo Jae-pil handed him, Il-mok asked, \"Did you manage to find any leads?\"\nSince he was already there, Il-mok was curious if there had been any progress.\n“Well, I have completed the first round of interviews with all the instructors, including Ma Do-yeong, but…”\nSensing Physician Seo's hesitation, Il-mok asked, \"Was there some kind of problem?\"\n\"It's not exactly a problem... but it's going to be hard to pin Instructor Ma Do-yeong as the culprit.\"\n\"...What's the reason? Did Ma Do-yeong not mention me at all?\"\n\"That's not it. In fact, if he had deliberately avoided talking about you, my suspicions would have grown stronger.”\n\"He talked about me, so why don't you find him suspicious?\"\nSeo Jae-pil sighed lightly.\n\"The thing is, every single instructor talked about you, Young Master.\"\n\"...Did you ask about me directly?\"\nSeo Jae-pil looked aggrieved after hearing his tone.\n\"I just casually asked if there were any disciples they were concerned about lately, and every single one of them started talking about you.\"\n\"???\"\nLooking at Il-mok's completely bewildered expression, Seo Jae-pil let out a dry laugh.\nWhen he compiled everything he'd heard from the instructors over the past few days, the results were mind-boggling.\nAccording to Instructor Eun Ryeo, four female disciples were creating chaos trying to win Il-mok's affections.\nAccording to Instructors Cheok Il-so and Jeong Gyu-seok, the male disciples were desperate to become friends with Il-mok.\nFrom Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi to the Vice Hall Master and all the instructors , everyone was keeping an eye on Il-mok.\nAnd that wasn't even the end of it.\n'Come to think of it, the Supreme One pays special attention to the Young Master too, and the same goes for the Elder Demonic Physician and me. And according to the rumors, even the young lady of the Hyeokryeon Family follows him around.'\nThe Young Master was truly a devilish man, enchanting everyone regardless of age, gender, or whether they were ally or enemy alike, without even trying.",

    "content": "Chapter 129: The Bait Must Be Dangled to Be Tasty (1)\n\"It seems like the problem is that you're just too outstanding, Young Master.\"\nSeo Jae-pil's words, delivered with what looked like an amused laugh, made my face scrunch up involuntarily.\n\"What the hell is that supposed to mean?\"\n\"Well, everyone's looking for you regardless of age or gender, so it doesn't really make sense to be suspicious of anyone who shows interest in you.\"\nThere was one particularly grating word that drilled into my ears.\n\"What kind of stories have you been hearing that make you say 'regardless of age or gender'?\"\n\"Haha. I heard it from the instructors. Not just the instructors either. Apparently, all the disciples, male and female alike, are quite interested in you, Young Master.\"\nThe part about female disciples being interested in me didn't bother me at all. It was the bit about male disciples being interested that got under my skin.\n\"...Don't even mention such horrifying things.\"\nThe mere mention of it conjured images of those certain crazy bastards in my head.\nMy mind was instantly filled with the revolting sight of those muscleheads from the Bodybuilding Club, flexing and grunting as they discussed me.\nShudder.\nI felt like I was about to throw up, so I quickly shook my head to banish those horrifying thoughts.\nWhen I finally regained my calm, I saw Seo Jae-pil watching me have my little breakdown with what looked like fascination.\n\"Whew. Anyway, the conclusion is that there's no particularly suspicious instructor. Pretty disappointing, all things considered.\"\nI didn't like the way he was looking at me like some kind of test subject, so I tried to jab him a bit, but it had no effect.\n“Hahaha. The study of the human psyche is not something that yields results overnight, Young Master.\"\nLooking at this perpetually cheerful bastard, a thought occurred to me. Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on Nove1Fire.net\n'Even if I started cursing him out right here, this crazy fuck would probably just get more excited, saying his research subject was having a meltdown.'\nI could already picture him gleefully jotting down notes about finding a new research topic.\n'Let's just ignore this nutjob for now. How can I catch someone's tail?'\nI was mulling it over by myself, but somehow it didn't feel like I was actually alone in my thoughts.\nAnd it wasn't because of Seo Jae-pil grinning away in front of me.\n—Hehe. If you're going to act as bait anyway, why not be a little more proactive about it?\nIt was because my other self, the one obsessed with perfectionism, kept coming up with useful suggestions.\nHow should I put it?\nRather than thinking alone, it felt more like I was having a discussion with another version of myself.\nAnd thanks to that damn side effect, I was able to organize my thoughts quickly.\n\"How about this instead? Let's shake them up.\"\n\"What kind of approach do you have in mind?\"\n\"Didn't you say it yourself, Physician Seo? That all the instructors are interested in me. So, let's throw out some bait. Me as the bait.\"\n\"????\"\nSeeing Seo Jae-pil's still-confused expression, I elaborated.\n\"I'm thinking of stirring up some other clubs. I’ll give off the impression that I want to switch.”\nFinally understanding my intent, Seo Jae-pil spoke with a surprised expression.\n\"That's an excellent idea, Young Master! There's a high chance that Instructor Ma Do-young will also change his behavior, and other instructors will be forced to make some kind of move too.\"\nI nodded at his words.\n“And as you continue your counseling sessions, conversations about my movements will naturally come up. It will be easier to spot anyone whose words don’t match their actions, or whose behavior seems contradictory.”\n\"As expected of you, Young Master. I think I'm starting to understand why people of all ages and genders end up admiring you. Haha.\"\n\".......\"\nIt was clearly a compliment, but it felt like I was being mocked for some reason.\nSince I'd decided to shake myself up as bait anyway, I figured I might as well be blatant about it.\n“…You want to try out the Theater Club?\"\nRepeating what I'd just said, Instructor Eun Ryeo was looking at me with a deeply suspicious expression.\nThe other instructors in the vicinity also turned their gazes toward us.\n\"Disciple Il-mok. Haven't you already joined the Meditation Club? You even went as far as to establish it yourself.\"\nI answered with a straight face at Instructor Eun Ryeo's point. Acting like I couldn't even feel the gazes of the instructors watching us from around.\n\"I think I was a bit hasty in creating a club without properly looking into the existing ones first, Instructor.\"\n\"So now you want to experience other clubs?\"\n\"That's right, Instructor.\"\nMy clean, simple answer somehow made Instructor Eun Ryeo's face crumple up.\nIt was quite the sight.\nThis person, who always maintained a poker face, was now sighing heavily.\n'Something about this feels similar to that day when Chu Il-hwan attacked me.'\nCome to think of it, I'd completely forgotten about it because of Chu Il-hwan's subsequent attack.\nShe’d suddenly shown up and given me a strange lecture before leaving. Now, with that same look of pity, she sighed and spoke.\n\"Really, you don't have even a speck of responsibility, do you?\"\nI felt like I'd heard something similar back then too, but now wasn't the time to explain that.\nI had bait to shake.\n\"Even if I were to transfer out of the Meditation Club, there would still be three people left, so it wouldn't be a big problem, would it?\"\n\"Are you seriously saying that right now...\"\nInstructor Eun Ryeo, who seemed about to argue further, soon let out another big sigh before returning to her usual cold mask.\n\"Fine. Since you were at the main headquarters when the club system was first introduced, you wouldn't have had a proper chance to look into the other clubs. Since Disciple Il-mok's case is special, I'll let it slide this time.\"\nAfter receiving her permission, I turned to leave the teachers' building.\nI could feel the gazes of several of them following my back.\nThat afternoon, Il-mok headed to that familiar clearing for the first time in a while.\nThe place that once only Il-mok and Jeong Hyeon used to visit, and which had now become something like a clubroom for the Theater Club.\nBaek Cheon, who had basically become the owner of the place, welcomed Il-mok with a very bright face.\n\"Haha! I believed in you, Young Master Il-mok!\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\nFor some reason, this time it was Bang Mi-hwa who stepped forward, letting out a laugh.\n\"How mischievous of you to ask that, hohoho. I also believed that you would naturally return to the Theater Club, Young Master.\"\n“Hahahaha! A man as outstanding as Young Master Il-mok deserves to be in the spotlight with me, Baek Cheon!”\n“Others may not be worthy, but you're certainly qualified to be my 'partner' in acting, Young Master. Ohohoho.\"\nWatching this pair of crazy actors laugh their heads off, Il-mok already felt dizzy.\n'Damn it. I haven’t even been here for a minute.'\nMa Do-yeong’s constant nagging had made the Meditation Club uncomfortable, but being here now made the Meditation Club seem like a paradise.\nJust as Il-mok was considering escape, a savior appeared in the unlikely form of Instructor Eun Ryeo.\n\"Alright. Stop chattering and start practicing. This is club time, not playtime.\"\nEun Ryeo got dizzy every time she came here too.\n\"Also, disciples are equals among themselves, so address him as Disciple Il-mok. How many times do I have to point this out?\"\nWhen Eun Ryeo sorted out the situation, the expressions of Baek Cheon and Bang Mi-hwa, who had been chatting with Il-mok, completely changed.\nThey might be crazy about everything else, but they were surprisingly serious when it came to acting.\n“Then, as always, we will begin with vocalization practice, Instructor.”\nSince Baek Cheon and Bang Mi-hwa were the ones leading the club time anyway, Eun Ryeo just nodded and stepped back.\nImmersed in their practice—or rather, immersed in the image of themselves practicing—Baek Cheon and Bang Mi-hwa began to lead the other students.\nAnd Eun Ryeo watched the scene while sneaking glances at Il-mok.\n'He definitely has impure motives, but there's nothing I can do about it.'\nIn her mind, Il-mok was already branded as a playboy.\nThe reason Eun Ryeo bothered to accept such an Il-mok was simple.\nInstructor Eun Ryeo's gaze had left Il-mok and turned toward Jeong Hyeon.\n'How did she end up liking such a playboy? Tsk.'\nIt was a click of the tongue not of disdain, but of pity.\nPerhaps because this was the first time in a while, Jeong Hyeon kept stealing glances at Il-mok.\nSensing Jeong Hyeon's gaze, Il-mok, who had been half-heartedly doing voice exercises, casually approached her.\nOf course, Il-mok stopped at exactly ten feet away as always.\nWhen Il-mok approached, Jeong Hyeon startled and stuttered.\n\"It's, it's been a while, Young Master.\"\n“Don’t we see each other every day in class?”\n“I-in the clearing, I-I mean… It’s been a while… right?”\n“I suppose so. Haha. Have you been enjoying the club?\"\nHe wanted to ask if she was having fun with Baek Cheon, but since Baek Cheon was right there, he phrased it more diplomatically.\nOf course, Jeong Hyeon wanted to say no. But…\n'Everyone’s watching, how can I say I don't like it…'\nHer inherent shyness had her glancing around nervously, and in the end, she couldn't help but lie. “I-it’s been fun.”\nSeeing Jeong Hyeon glance toward Baek Cheon as she answered, Il-mok nodded, thinking 'as expected.'\n'Her feelings for Baek Cheon haven't changed, I see.'\nShe was really going down a tough path.\n\"Hang in there, Disciple Jeong Hyeon.\"\n“Th-thank you.”\nWhen Jeong Hyeon blushed at Il-mok's encouragement, Instructor Eun Ryeo, who was watching, let out a big sigh.\nThat sigh seemed to be a cue for Bang Mi-hwa to Il-mok.\nDeep in her acting, she had only just noticed Il-mok chatting with Jeong Hyeon.\n\"Disciple Il-mok! You need to focus on practice.\"\nSaying this, Bang Mi-hwa pulled Il-mok over along with Ha Young and Ju Seo-yeon.\nIl-mok was surrounded by three women while Jeong Hyeon watched the four while being ten feet away.\nWatching this pitiful scene, Eun Ryeo sighed once again.\nDay by day, managing her expressions was becoming more difficult.\nBut soon Eun Ryeo returned to her characteristic cold expression.\nShe could sense someone approaching.\n\"What brings you here, Instructor Ma Do-young?\"\nIt was because Ma Do-young, the instructor in charge of the meditation club, had suddenly come to the clearing.\n\"Excuse me, Head Instructor. If it's alright, may I have a word with Disciple Il-mok?”\nEun Ryeo, who found the sight of Il-mok laughing while surrounded by women quite distasteful, readily agreed.\n\"Disciple Il-mok!\"\nHearing her call, Il-mok, who had escaped from among the women, soon spotted Ma Do-young.\n\"What brings you here, Instructor?\"\nMa Do-young's forehead veins bulged at the seemingly innocent face, but he maintained his smile as he spoke.\n\"Let's move somewhere else to talk first.\"\nSaying this, Ma Do-young turned and left the clearing with a swift motion, and Il-mok followed.\nBut Il-mok stopped after a few steps. He judged it dangerous to go to some secluded place where there were no people. There was a pretty high chance this guy was a rat.\nSensing that the presence behind him had stopped, Ma Do-yeong also stopped and turned around.\n\"Disciple Il-mok. What exactly are you trying to do?\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n“Huuu. I went so far as to accept the position of Meditation Club advisor at your request, and now you want to switch to another club. Do you really think this makes any sense?”\nAt Ma Do-young's question, Il-mok answered with a confused expression.\n“I thought you would want me to, Instructor, so I decided to switch clubs.”\n\"...What kind of twisted logic is that, saying I would want it?\"\n“During class, during club activities… You seemed uncomfortable around me, didn't you? Since I couldn't dare ask you to change your assignment, I, a mere student, decided to be the one to transfer.”\n\".......\"\nMa Do-young was momentarily speechless.\nNot because Il-mok's words were logical.\n'That's just because you're lazy as hell!!!'\nBlood rushed to his head, making it difficult to even speak. And on top of that…\n'Dammit!! If I try to force him to stay, I risk raising suspicion, just like the Vice Hall Master said. But if I let him go, he’ll end up transferring to another club.'\nIf that happened, all his plans to monitor Il-mok closely and look for opportunities would fall apart.\nThat meant his chance to achieve merit would also disappear.\nHe couldn't stop him, but he couldn't just let him go either.\n'Should I just kill him? Should I just kill him now? If I kill him, wouldn't that still count as achieving something?'\nWith all other paths blocked, the final option kept popping into Ma Do-yeong's head.\nMeanwhile, back in the Meditation Club’s room.\nWith Il-mok, the one who had dragged them into the club, and Ma Do-yeong, the instructor in charge, both absent…\n\"Sigh.\"\n\"Why the hell are we...\"\nThe sighs of the trio, filled with complex emotions, echoed one after another.",

    "content": "Chapter 130: The Bait Must Be Dangled to Be Tasty (2)\nMa Do-yeong, who had been deep in thought, mustered up all his patience and asked.\n\"So, are you planning to transfer to the Theater Club?\"\nMa Do-yeong had considered various options, like forcibly keeping Il-mok in the Meditation Club, or even clinging to him and begging him not to leave.\nBut both actions would undoubtedly arouse suspicion. Especially the latter, that would be something an instructor should absolutely never do.\nTo Ma Do-yeong's probing question, Il-mok happily took the bait.\n\"Nothing's set in stone yet. I'm thinking of trying out some other clubs first. If none of them suit me, I might just come back to the Meditation Club, you know?\"\nFaced with Il-mok’s temptation, Ma Do-yeong summoned every ounce of his composure to feign indifference.\n“I understand. Ah, and separate from the club issue, it seems there has been a misunderstanding. The reason I reprimanded you was not because I have any ill will toward you. As an instructor, I can't just let a trainee slack off.\"\n“So you’re saying nothing will change even if I return to the Meditation Club?”\n\"Just don't slack off and you'll be fine.\"\n\"...I'll keep that in mind when choosing a club.\"\n“Do as you will.”\nMa Do-yeong nodded and turned to leave.\n‘This should be enough to clear any suspicion, right??’\nAt least he acted like a proper instructor at the end.\n‘They say don't lose the big picture chasing small gains. It would be foolish to get myself suspected just for a shot at glory. For now, my priority is to clear any suspicions on me.’\nWatching Ma Do-yeong's retreating figure, Il-mok thought to himself.\n‘Yeah, still suspicious as fuck.’\nContrary to his expectations, Ma Do-yeong had failed completely to shake off any suspicion.\nThe next day, I continued my tour of the clubs during club hours without fail. Today’s destination was the Doctrine Research Club.\nTo put it another way, it was the Crazy Fanatics Manufacturing Club.\n\"Welcome, Disciple Il-mok.\"\nAs I entered the hall, the supervising instructor and doctrine education instructor Jeong Gyu-seok greeted me warmly.\nIt was a weird feeling.\n‘Huh. I thought he'd be pissed off?’\nThe trio I'd recruited for the Meditation Club originally belonged to the Doctrine Research Club.\nI wasn’t sure how seriously the instructors took these clubs, but I had essentially stolen three of his members, so I thought he'd be annoyed.\nBut here he was, welcoming me with open arms.\n‘Don't tell me this guy's another rat?’\nNaturally, that suspicion popped up.\n\"Welcome!\"\n\"We're glad to have you, Disciple’ Il-mok!\"\nBut the chorus of welcomes that followed diluted that suspicion a bit.\n‘What the hell, why are there so many of them?’\nThe hall was packed with easily more than ten students bustling about.\nIf those three I'd poached were still here, it would've been close to twenty people.\nConsidering each class only had about twenty students each, that meant nearly half were in the Doctrine Research Club.\n‘If I were an instructor, I'd be relieved that three of them left.’\nEven with teaching assistants, managing over ten students with just two people was exhausting work.\nMore importantly, with all the cadets flocking to his club, he must have been insanely jealous of the other instructors who had it easy.\n‘Yeah, when you’re swamped with work and your colleagues are chilling, it’s a special kind of shitty. Yup.’\nIt reminded me of my civil servant days.\nAnd the question of why so many students flocked to the Doctrine Research Club was answered as quickly as it arose.\n‘Just look at Jin Hayeon...’\nThe disciples at the Hall of the Demonic Way were the promising talents of the Demonic Cult. And being a promising talent of the Demonic Cult was synonymous with being a wannabe religious fanatic.\nSo from the students’ perspective, if they didn't have any special hobbies, joining the Doctrine Research Club was the most natural thing in the world.\nWeirdos like Baek Cheon and Bang Mi-hwa, who were obsessed with theater, or guys like Dokgo Pae and Mak Ho-yeol, who were into bodybuilding, were the rare kinds of exception.\nAnd people like Ha Young, Jeong Hyeon, Ju Seo-yeon, and Gwak Sul who got dragged in by those weirdos were just the unfortunate victims.\nMaybe it was because I kept getting dragged around by those weirdos and unfortunate souls.\n‘How the hell is it that in a club with nearly half the students of the batch, I don't recognize a single friendly face?’\nIt wasn’t that I didn’t recognize anyone. I had been here for over half a year, after all. It was just that there wasn’t a single person here I was even remotely close to.\nI could've felt discouraged about my social connections being limited to absolute nutjobs, but there was no need for that.\n‘It’s just because those crazy bastards are the ones who latch onto me.’\nA flexible tendency to blame others and a talent for mental gymnastics were the secrets to a clear and healthy mind.\n\"Alright, now that everyone's here, let's divide into groups. Since this is Disciple Il-mok’s first time, let’s put him with cadets he is at least acquainted with.”\n\"???\"\nI didn't quite get what was happening, but I went along with Instructor Jeong Gyu-seok's lead.\nMaybe because it'd be impossible to have a conversation with everyone talking at once, Instructor Jeong Gyu-seok divided the students into three groups.\nEach group had five or six people.\nAnd the people who ended up at the same table as me welcomed me once again.\n“We look forward to working with you, Disciple Il-mok.”\n“We hope you have a pleasant time.”\nAll these friendly greetings made me smile awkwardly.\n‘…I really do only know them by face.’\nAs per the instructor’s consideration, they were indeed people I was acquainted with. They were from the same class year, had been in the same group during an exam, or had briefly been in the Upper Class with me.\n\"Nice to meet you all. Please take care of me too.\"\nShortly after my simple greeting, Instructor Jeong Gyu-seok announced the day’s topic, and the club activities officially began.\n“Today’s topic is Chapter 13, Verse 5 of the Doctrine. Please begin your discussions.”\n\"Well then, let me start and we'll go around in order.\"\nOne of the students in my group opened his mouth and started his speech.\n\"The Seventh Heavenly Demon, the Bloodthirsty Heavenly Demon, said that to truly punish evil, greater evil is necessary. Those hypocrites from Buddhism and Taoism define murder as evil, but that's just hypocrisy. Only by cutting out the seeds of evil early can we save the masses from suffering under evil.\"\nWhether he was a hardliner obsessed with the cult's doctrine, this trainee's argument was basically \"let's just kill all the bad guys.\" Another trainee shot his hand up and objected.\n\"I think you're misinterpreting the Bloodthirsty Heavenly Demon's words. While it's right to fight evil with evil, resorting to indiscriminate slaughter is a dangerous idea. As Prophet Jeong said in Chapter 3, Verse 10, all humans harbor evil in their hearts. So are you saying we should kill every single human?\"\n\"I agree with that point. As you can see in Chapter 10, Verse 3, the Fifth Heavenly Demon, the Blood-Rain Heavenly Demon, said that ruling the world with demonic power means guiding the masses to be wary of their own evil so they don't fall into wickedness.\"\nThey'd said they'd go in order, but instead they started spouting their own opinions and creating a tense atmosphere from the start.\nAnd this wasn't limited to just my group.\n\"Disciple Guk is completely misinterpreting the doctrine!\"\nAt other tables too, they were glaring at each other and shouting like they wanted to kill each other, each spouting off their understanding of the doctrine.\n\"Look at Chapter 5, Verse 7 of the doctrine!\"\n“Silence! The Prophet said!\"\nListening to all the doctrine talk coming from every direction, I felt dizzy.\nIt wasn't because I didn't know the content.\nI had been forced by Jin Hayeon to memorize the entire doctrine to enter the Hall after all.\nEvery time these bastards mentioned some verse, that verse would naturally pop up in my head, that's how well I'd memorized it.\nFor example, the Blood-Rain Heavenly Demon that the student in my group mentioned earlier.\n‘A Total psycho.’\nHe believed that greater demonic power should be used to prevent the masses' evil deeds, so he periodically executed evildoers in front of the masses to instill fear. To make them too scared to even think of committing evil acts.\nHe used the Heavenly Demon Divine Arts to tear the evildoers’ bodies to shreds, splashing blood everywhere. That’s how he came to be known as the Blood-Rain Heavenly Demon.\nEven though I knew everything they were yelling about, the reason my head was spinning was simple.\nIt was precisely because I knew the content.\nThe doctrine content I'd tried to avoid since entering the Hall of the Demonic Way was filling my head again.\nLooking at their faces as they debated enthusiastically, Jin Hayeon naturally came to mind.\nTheir eyes were filled with the same madness. They believed all truth was contained in the doctrine and were passionately spouting off about it.\nHonestly, I'd studied and memorized the doctrine too, but my stance was this:\nIt’s just twisting words to fit the situation.\nI'd listened to Jin Hayeon's explanations earnestly, but honestly, it felt like everything was forced. So rather than trying to understand it, I just memorized her explanations wholesale and moved on.\nThere were often cases like that.\nWhen something happened, people would say, \"See, the words of the ancient sages are never wrong.\"\nBut even among those ancient sages' words, there were quite a few contradictions.\nThe classic example of being \"the more the merrier\" versus \"too much of anything is bad.\"\nIf having more of something works out, it's \"the more the merrier,\" but if it goes wrong, it's \"too much of anything is bad.\"\nSimilarly, there were definitely contradictory elements in the doctrine. Thıs content belongs to N0veI.Fiɾe.net\nBut Jin Hayeon didn't think that way at all.\nIf there were two contradictory verses, A and B, when event X happened, she would explain, ‘As expected, it happened according to doctrine A, therefore the doctrine is true.’ And when event Y happened, it would be, ‘As expected, it happened according to doctrine B, therefore the doctrine is true.’\nIt was ridiculous as hell, but I just went along with it, thinking, \"So this is how cults work.\"\nIf I'd pointed it out, she might've tried to kill me for being a heretic, or wouldn't have stopped the brainwashing until I accepted it.\nAnd here, in this room…\n\"Hey! Are you saying the Bloodthirsty Heavenly Demon's words are wrong?\"\n“That’s an exaggeration! That’s not what I meant, is it? You’re the one twisting his words to your own liking!”\nThese wannabe fanatics were endlessly debating doctrine, just like Jin Hayeon.\nThanks to them, I was half in a daze when…\n\"What do you think, Disciple Il-mok?\"\n\"Come to think of it, Disciple Il-mok hasn't said anything yet.\"\nThe cult fanatics all focused their attention on me. Their eyes were so clear they looked like genuinely insane.\n‘Uh, um… so it’s basically ‘hardliner’ versus ‘moderate,’ right?’\nThe hardliners wanted to kill anyone even slightly bad, while the moderates wanted to tear apart only the worst evildoers as examples to instill vigilance in the masses, since humans are inherently evil.\n‘...Either way, they both want to kill people, don't they?’\nThese fucking insane Demonic Cult fanatics were all about killing first and questions never.\nBut I couldn't condemn them as crazy bastards.\nThey were poor souls who'd been brainwashed since childhood.\nThat wasn't the reason, though.\n‘One wrong word and they'll turn into inquisitors...’\nThe madness gleaming in their eyes was no joke.\nAfter much deliberation, I opened my mouth carefully.\n\"Both sides have problems. All humans are evil, so killing everyone doesn't make sense. But who defines what an ‘excessively evil person’ is? There is only one person who can make that distinction: the Heavenly Demon of the era.”\nIf you guys are the hardliners and moderates, then I’m the centrist.\nThe fanatics nodded, seemingly satisfied with my answer.\n\"Indeed, so everything ultimately comes down to the Supreme One's will.\"\n“As expected of the Supreme One’s disciple. But as future talents of the cult who should aspire to leadership someday, shouldn't we establish our own standards?\"\nAnd just like that, they went back to fighting amongst themselves, passionately debating the doctrines they held most dear.\nSitting alone in a daze, watching the fanatics' war of words, I made a promise to myself.\n‘...Even if I change clubs, I'm never coming back here.’\nI swore I wouldn't go anywhere near the Doctrine Research Club ever again.",

    "content": "Chapter 131: The Bait Must Be Dangled to Be Tasty (3)\nThankfully, the club activity time ended before I could get completely brainwashed.\n\"Disciple Il-mok. There's still time left before lights out, so let's talk a bit more...\"\n\"Sorry, but I'm out.\"\nThe students who'd been eagerly debating tried to hold me back, but I bolted out of the building without a second thought.\nAs I rushed toward the Black Dragon Hall...\n\"Hahaha! I'm sure you'll join the Doctrine Research Club!\"\nInstructor Jeong Gyu-seok's friendly laughter echoed in my ears.\nMy club tour continued even after my experiences with the Theater and Doctrine Research Clubs.\nBut honestly, none of the remaining clubs were particularly useful.\nIt wasn't about my interests or hobbies. The problem was that all the other clubs were run by instructors from senior year.\nIt all went back to the incident where I first felt a sense of unease in the Hall, when I ended up stranded in the Peach Blossom Ridge. I had been avoiding someone’s presence when I accidentally slipped through the formation of the exam grounds. It could have been a series of unbelievable coincidences, but the circumstances strongly suggested there was a mole among the instructors or assistants.\nAnd since the senior class was out on practical training with the martial unit at that time, the only suspects were the instructors and assistants managing our class.\nOf course, there could be spies among the senior class too, but it made sense to focus on the most likely suspects first.\nIn that regard, there was only one club left for me to visit.\nThe place I really didn't want to go to since it caused psychological revulsion for me. But also the place where one of the main suspects served as the supervising instructor.\nThe Bodybuilding Club.\n\"Bwahaha! Welcome, Disciple Il-mok!\" Instructor Cheok Il-so greeted Il-mok with a hearty laugh.\n\"We've been waiting for you, Disciple Il-mok!\"\n\"I thought my neck was gonna snap from all the waiting, Junior Il-mok! Hahaha. Why'd you come to our Bodybuilding Club last of all?\"\n\"Obviously, he saved the most interesting club for last!\"\n\"Bwahaha! That's right! If he'd come to our club first, the other clubs would've seemed boring as hell!\"\nDokgo Pae and Mak Ho-yeol chattered excitedly amongst themselves.\n\"Sigh.\"\nAnd then there was Gwak Sul, standing a step away, sighing as if he were a complete stranger.\n‘Why the hell are they all shirtless...’\nThe sweat dripping down their muscles kept triggering Il-mok's hygiene obsessions, making him want to turn around and leave immediately.\n\"Come on! Take off your shirt!”\nAt Cheok Il-so's order, Il-mok sighed and asked back.\n\"Why do I need to take my shirt off?\"\n\"Bwahaha! Well, it's so we can examine each other's muscles more closely. You can only achieve truly effective training by observing the detailed movements of muscles!\"\nIt was actually a reasonable point.\nIl-mok wasn't much of a fitness enthusiast even in the modern world, but he'd heard about it before.\nPeople said it was good to wear form-fitting clothes or sleeveless tops that showed your body lines when working out.\nGym and pilates enthusiasts always wore tight clothes or nearly backless sleeveless tops.\nBut Il-mok had already witnessed something he shouldn't have seen.\nThe horrifying sight of them stripping off their shirts and groping each other's muscles.\nUgh.\nThe moment someone touched his body with sweaty hands, he felt like he might reflexively draw his sword.\n\"...Don't you think it's unnecessary to strip? I mean, you don't take off your pants just because you're training your legs, right?\"\nIl-mok tried to get around it with sophistry, but the response was spectacular.\n\"How did you know that, junior Il-mok?\"\n\"Hahaha! Looks like Disciple Il-mok has been watching us closely!\"\n\"???\"\n‘What kind of crazy shit have these lunatics been doing in the middle of the main training grounds where everyone can see?’\nIgnoring my horrified expression, Instructor Cheok Il-so suddenly stripped off his pants with a proud flourish.\n‘What the fuck?!’\nIl-mok quickly turned his head away, not wanting to see that horrific sight, but Instructor Cheok Il-so's laughter drilled into his ears.\n“Hahaha! Don’t you worry! It’s not like I’m only wearing my undergarments!”\nAt those words, Il-mok cautiously turned his head back to see that Instructor Cheok Il-so was wearing pretty short pants that came up to about a third of his thighs.\n\"These are special training pants I made myself for external martial arts training! Bwahaha!\"\nA quick glance revealed they were pretty crappy, hardly worthy of being called \"self-made.\"\nRather than being carefully sewn or tailored, it looked like he'd just cut off the bottom of regular pants with something sharp.\nApparently, he'd chopped up perfectly good pants as short as possible to examine muscles closely.\n\"We were so impressed by the instructor's pants that we made our own too!\"\nAs if moved by Cheok Il-so's exhibitionism, Mak Ho-yeol and Dokgo Pae also stripped off their pants one after another.\nSure enough, they were also wearing shorts that ended at the one-third mark of their thighs.\n‘They did a real sloppy job cutting those.’\nThe frayed threads at the hem were coming loose. Maybe they'd gotten worn out during external martial arts training from all the muscle contractions and expansions, then frayed even more during washing.\nIl-mok thought to himself: With a bit of bad luck, those shorts could very well rip completely, leading to a disaster.\nOf course, those crazy bastards would probably just laugh off something like that.\n‘I don't want to see that disgusting sight!’\nWhile Il-mok was frantically shaking his head at the revolting scene that had popped into his mind...\n\"Hahaha! I was planning to focus mainly on upper body muscle training since it's your first day, but if you're interested, I can make your pants like this too. Hahaha!\"\nAs if responding to Instructor Cheok Il-so's hearty laughter, his whole body's muscles flexed and bulged.\nThanks to wearing nothing but what might have been pants or boxer shorts, the movement was utterly and obscenely exposed.\nUgh.\nHe quickly looked away in disgust, but...\n\"Bwahaha!\"\n\"Ahahahahaha!\"\nAll he could see were Mak Ho-yeol and Dokgo Pae in similar states.\n‘I should just cut them all down!’\n‘Purify those dirty, sweat-soaked bodies!’\nIl-mok felt his hand unconsciously reaching for his sword.\nThat night.\nAfter surviving the horrific club experience, Il-mok visited the infirmary again for the first time in seven days.\n\"Did you find any leads, Young Master?\"\nIl-mok let out a deep sigh before answering.\n\"Whew. Well, I don't think it's Instructor Eun Ryeo.\"\nShe didn't seem particularly eager to recruit him into the Theater Club. It felt more like she was reluctantly accepting him.\nPlus...\n‘The fact that she was with me during Instructor Chu Il-hwan's rampage pretty much clears her of suspicion.’\nAs if agreeing with Il-mok's reasoning, Physician Seo Jae-pil nodded.\n“I also conducted two more rounds of counseling with the instructors over the past seven days, and Instructor Eun Ryeo’s attitude was certainly consistent.”\nEun Ryeo consistently talked about her concerns for Jeong Hyeon. She did mention Il-mok too, but consistently described him as just a troublemaker bothering Jeong Hyeon.\n\"Hmm. I'm curious about what exactly was said.\"\nAt Il-mok's question, Physician Seo Jae-pil smiled and replied.\n\"Patient counseling records can't be disclosed. You know that, Young Master.\"\nHe wasn’t hiding that to insult Il-mok. As he said, those were the regulations of the Pure Mind Hall.\nCounseling content was shared among physicians for research purposes, but even then, all names were kept confidential. Googlᴇ search novel-fire.ɴet\nThis was just a special case where they were providing limited information necessary for deducing the spy.\nSince Il-mok knew this fact, he just shrugged and accepted it easily.\n\"Can't be helped.\"\nAfter all, he was the one who had proposed and established this system in the first place.\n\"So what about Instructor Ma Do-yeong? I still find him the most suspicious.\"\nAt Il-mok's question, the smile disappeared from Seo Jae-pil's face.\nThe Vice Hall Master's office at the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nVice Hall Master Yu Geuk and another instructor were concluding a formal discussion about Hall business.\n\"What do you think about Instructor Ma?\"\nThe instructor, who had been pondering for a moment, carefully spoke up.\n\"So that instructor really was the reinforcement sent by 'that person'?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"...Sigh. Honestly, I felt like he was moving too conspicuously,\" the instructor said with a deep sigh.\nIn case of emergencies, they operated as a kind of cell network.\nThe instructor hadn't been informed that Ma Do-yeong was a comrade, and Ma Do-yeong also knew there was another colleague but didn't know who it was.\nOnly Yu Geuk, their superior, would meet with them alternately and give orders.\nIn fact, this instructor had been recruited by Yu Geuk and was, for all intents and purposes, his subordinate. Unlike Yu Geuk, he didn't know exactly who 'that person' was.\nWhether Ma Do-yeong was in the same boat, even Yu Geuk couldn’t say.\n\"Apparently, 'that person' took the Hall's affairs too lightly.\"\n\"...Probably thought it was just teaching some kids.\"\nPeople who hadn't worked as instructors at the Hall of the Demonic Way would never understand.\nWhat was so difficult about teaching some kids martial arts and various knowledge?\nBut the real problem wasn't about how skilled the teacher was. Dealing with young people was a separate issue altogether. Especially young ones suffering from the side effects of Demonic Arts.\n‘Sigh. If only this were the old Hall of the Demonic Way, this would've been easy to finish.’\nUnlike Chu Il-hwan or the instructor in front of him, Yu Geuk was someone who had graduated from the Hall of the Demonic Way of the old days, just like the current Hall Master.\nThat hellish education process where half the disciples died before graduation.\nIf he’d been given the mission to kill the Eighth Young Master back then, it would have been simple. He could have just made it look like an accident during a difficult mission or training session.\nBut not now.\nWhile there were still occasional disappearances and serious injuries at the current Hall, deaths were rare, happening only once every few years. If a death occurred now and the circumstances were suspicious, it would risk an investigation..\nWhile Yu Geuk briefly reminisced about the grim atmosphere of the Hall he'd experienced in his youth, the instructor in front of him carefully spoke up.\n\"The fact that you told me about Instructor Ma, does that mean you've made some kind of decision?\"\nPulled from his reverie, Yu Geuk returned to his cold face and nodded.\n“The sudden stationing of a physician from the Pure Mind Hall, and Young Master Il-mok frequently visiting the infirmary under the guise of counseling… it seems neither he nor the Supreme One has let go of their suspicions.”\n“I felt the same, Vice Hall Master. During my counseling sessions, while not overt, I felt a strange sense of unease.”\n\"Given that, I think it's only a matter of time before Instructor Ma gets caught.\"\nThe fact that they hadn't arrested Ma Do-yeong yet suggested they hadn’t figured everything out completely. But in Yu Geuk’s view, it wouldn’t be long.\n\"So, do you have some plan in mind?\"\nAt the instructor's question, Yu Geuk nodded and replied, “I intend to deal with them together. With the youngest lord.”\n\"!!!\"\nYu Geuk ignored the instructor's shocked expression and continued his explanation.\n\"I'm thinking of setting up a reasonably sloppy trap and giving false orders to Instructor Ma. Then, right after Instructor Ma kills the Eighth Young Master, you and I will step in and take care of Instructor Ma.\"\nThe instructor asked with a tense expression after hearing the risky plan. “Won’t that only deepen their suspicion of us?”\n“We can just use the excuse that his resistance was fierce while we were trying to subdue him. Either way, we dealt with a murderer. We didn't attack the Eight Young Master. Besides, since Instructor Ma is already under suspicion, we need to deal with him anyway.”\nEven with Yu Geuk's explanation, the instructor's worries weren't completely gone.\n\"I'm not sure if 'that person' you follow will be satisfied with this.\"\n\"Don't worry. 'That person' wasn't directly involved in bringing Instructor Ma here. Moreover, dead men tell no tales, do they? The moment Ma Do-yeong dies, the tail disappears too.\"\nHaving finished his explanation, Yu Geuk's cold expression twisted strangely.\n\"And Instructor Ma told me something interesting.\"\n\"Something interesting?\"\nHis eyes gleamed dangerously as one corner of his mouth lifted crookedly in a sneer.\n\"He said that in urgent situations, it is standard procedure to act first and report later. So now, shouldn't we kill Instructor Ma and report to that person later?\"\nAt Yu Geuk's words, the instructor's mouth also twisted strangely.\n\"As you said, Vice Hall Master, dead men tell no tales.\"",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 132",
    "content": "Chapter 132: The Bait Must Be Dangled to Be Tasty (4)\nSeo Jae-pil's expression turned serious as he carefully began to speak. \"Your role as bait seems to have been effective, Young Master.\"\n\"You noticed something fishy?\"\nSeo Jae-pil nodded at the question.\n\"His words were consistent enough. But during our conversation, there were moments... moments where he hesitated, and you could catch glimpses of hesitation.\"\nIt was definitely just fleeting moments of hesitation and doubt. So brief that others wouldn't have noticed.\nBut Seo Jae-pil had spent months as a physician at the Pure Mind Hall, counseling martial artists who were learning Demonic Arts.\nThrough that experience, he'd seen countless people hiding things or telling lies.\nTheir reasons for lying or concealing things were pretty much the same across the board.\n'They wanted to hide their experiences of being overwhelmed by side effects.'\nSince they were all people you'd call \"masters,\" most of them had strong pride. For people like that, admitting they'd struggled with mental illness wasn't easy.\nHell, even regular people found it embarrassing to talk about their mental health issues.\nBut...\n\"Most importantly, we're still in the early stages of counseling, so we haven't even had any deep conversations yet. We were just talking about life in the Hall of the Demonic Way and about the students. But even with such trivial topics, he acted like he was having some incredibly important conversation, hesitating and mulling over his answers.”\nSomething was definitely off if someone had to think that hard about answering even the most pointless small talk.\n\"Especially after you started your club tour, Young Master, that attitude became even more pronounced.\"\n\"As I thought...\"\nSo that was why he kept picking fights with me. He had approached me with malicious intent from the very beginning.\n'Holy shit. What kind of idiots send a mole who reveals his hostility so blatantly?'\nIt never even occurred to Il-mok that his lazy behavior might be the catalyst for that hostility.\nWhile Il-mok was chuckling at Ma Do-yeong's incompetence, Seo Jae-pil asked, \"So, should I report this directly to the Hall Master?\"\nFor some reason, Il-mok shook his head at that question.\n\"Wouldn't that be a waste? Apart from Ma Do-yeong, there's another mole hiding in the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\n“Won’t we find that out by capturing and interrogating Ma Do-yeong?”\n\"That's naive thinking. You think Ma Do-yeong would sell out his colleagues that easily?\"\n\"...It's not really my place to say as a physician, but the Divine Cult's interrogation methods aren't exactly gentle.\"\n\"What if he doesn't clam up, but feeds us false information instead?\"\nOnly then did Seo Jae-pil realize what Il-mok was getting at, letting out a soft \"Ah\" of understanding.\n\"That's definitely a possibility. But even if Ma Do-yeong frames someone else, won't the truth eventually come out if we interrogate the framed individual and investigate their activities?”\n\"Do you have any idea how many innocent people would get interrogated in that process?\"\nIl-mok's words of concern for potentially innocent victims made Seo Jae-pil look moved, but Il-mok had different motivations.\nIf it were people close to him being interrogated, that would be one thing. But the rest were strangers to him. No, less than strangers. He couldn't care less whether those cultist fanatics got interrogated or not.\n‘If, during that wrongful interrogation, someone lies to avoid torture or even gives a false confession, things will get complicated.’\nWorrying about innocent victims was just an excuse – he was really considering the possibility of failing to root out the problem completely due to being misled by false confessions.\n'These bastards are after my head, so if I don't handle this properly, it'll be annoying as hell.'\nOf course, if there was no other solution, he might have just ended it there. But now, a very good card had fallen into my hands.\n“More importantly, now that we’ve identified one of the moles, is there any reason to throw that card away?\n“Are you suggesting we use Ma Do-yeong as a pawn?”\n\"Exactly.\"\nThe reason he could think of a way to use Ma Do-yeong wasn't just because of his obsessive compulsions.\n'I never thought movies would come in handy like this.'\nHe'd remembered something from a movie he'd seen.\nTo find the kingpin of a drug organization, they identified a drug mule but didn't arrest him, choosing to tail him instead.\n'But how did that movie end again...?'\nThinking back, they did find the head, but instead of cleanly capturing him, they barely managed to catch him after a fierce battle.\nIt was a somewhat unsatisfying ending, but Il-mok didn't care.\n'Well, the Hall Master is on our side anyway, so what's the problem?'\nEven if a fierce battle broke out in the Hall of the Demonic Way, the Hall Master would clean it up in the end.\nThe same went if the fight occurred at the main headquarters. The Heavenly Demon, who owned the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, was on their side – what was there to worry about?\nWhile Il-mok was lost in his thoughts, Seo Jae-pil looked uncertain and asked, \"But even if we use Ma Do-yeong to catch another minion, couldn't that person also tell lies?\"\nHe had a pretty sharp mind for a doctor. It was a good point. As he said, the rats in the Hall were all just minions. They weren’t the ‘kingpin.’\nBut...\n\"If we capture several pawns, we can cross-reference the information they give us. We interrogate those bastards in separate spaces and cut off their information flow.\"\nOnly then did Seo Jae-pil fully understand Il-mok's intention and nod.\n\"In that case, as you said, Young Master, there should be fewer innocent victims from false testimony cases.\"\n\"Well, if they've already coordinated their stories in case they get caught, this method would be useless too.\"\n\"...?\"\nThen why go through all this trouble?\nBefore Seo Jae-pil could voice this question, Il-mok brought up something unexpected. Updates are released by novel(ꜰ)ire.net\n\"By any chance, do the physicians at the Pure Mind Hall use some kind of code? To hide information about patients' personal details, or for some other purpose?\"\n\"...There is one.\"\nLooking at Seo Jae-pil's expression which seemed to ask why he was asking this, Il-mok said, \"Then, could you give me some paper and a brush? I want you to convert what I'm about to write into that code. Make it look like I'm requesting hand sanitizer again, or disguise it as counseling content about some instructor.\"\n\"!!!\"\nSeo Jae-pil asked with a shocked expression:\n\"Don't tell me... when you requested hand sanitizer alcohol before, you had already calculated this entire situation?\"\nIl-mok shrugged lightly.\n\"You never know, right? There might be moles among those who travel between the main headquarters and the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\nIl-mok answered casually, as if it was no big deal, and held out his hand as if telling him to hurry up and bring the paper and brush.\nWhen Seo Jae-pil saw what Il-mok had written at the very top of the paper, his eyes widened in shock.\n\"You... you're going to write about THAT?\"\nWhat was written there was a request to the Heavenly Demon for permission to use a certain item.\n\"With this, we can get a confession out of them no matter what story they’ve concocted, can’t we?”\n“…In that case, couldn’t we just use it on Ma Do-yeong alone after capturing him?”\n\"The problem is, if we use this, half of what they say will be nonsense, so we'd still need the same cross-verification. Also, Master might refuse to let us use it.\"\n\"Ah...\"\nAs Seo Jae-pil nodded in understanding, Il-mok was already writing the next sentence on the paper.\nThe content of the second sentence was a request for reinforcements.\nThey needed a surveillance team to secretly follow Ma Do-yeong, their chess piece.\nBut if they moved too many people unnecessarily, there was a risk the targets would hide.\nThey needed to monitor Ma Do-yeong with minimal personnel, without making the targets feel suspicious.\nAnd Il-mok knew someone who was excellent at stealth and concealment.\n'Last time, she said she was sorry for not being much help, so I should ask for her assistance this time.'\nTwo days later, after finishing my daily routine, I headed to the Theater Club.\n\"Haha! Welcome, Junior Il-mok!\"\n\"Hohohoho. Please take care of us today too.\"\nWatching Baek Cheon and Bang Mi-hwa greet me without fail, a sigh escaped my lips.\n'Once I catch the head, I'm quitting immediately.'\nIt wasn’t like I came back to the club because I liked it. Being with attention whores like Bang Mi-hwa and Baek Cheon was mentally exhausting.\nIf it weren't for Instructor Ma Do-yeong, the Meditation Club would definitely be the best. For lazing around, at least.\n'I have to make him let his guard down, so I have no choice.'\nAfter going through the trouble of applying for a club tour to use myself as bait, going back to the Meditation Club now would be suspicious in many ways.\nThat’s why I had returned to the relatively safest option, the Theater Club. I had considered going to the Bodybuilding or Doctrine Research Clubs to monitor other potential rats, but…\n'If I stayed there, I might fall into Qi Deviation and go berserk.'\nAnd if I went berserk, they might happily use that as an excuse to stab me with a sword, so I had to give up on that idea.\nWhile I was thinking about those two most horrible clubs, Ju Seo-yeon had approached me.\n\"Young Master Il-mok.\"\nFrom her sneaky way of speaking, I could somehow predict what she was going to say next.\n“When you went to the main headquarters for your injury, did you meet Lady Jin Hayeon?\"\n\"I didn't see her.\"\nSince I'd anticipated the question, I answered without any change in my expression. I decided not to think about why I could predict what this crazy person would ask.\n\"Really? Lady Jin Hayeon served you directly, Young Master Il-mok, didn't she?\"\n\"Maybe it's because I'm just a student currently. Miss Jin is probably somewhere focusing on her training.\"\nI was glad I'd lied.\nShe was already pestering me this much when I said no. What if I had told her I was with Jin Hayeon?\n'She would have stuck to me all day long, grilling me about Jin Hayeon's recent life.'\nShe had the perfect mindset of a sasaeng fan.\nOf course, I had no intention of dealing with such a fan, and also...\n\"Disciple Ju. I've told you countless times that students should address each other as Disciple. How many more times do I need to tell you?\"\nInstructor Eun Ryeo's cold eyes were directed at both me and Ju Seo-yeon.\n'Why me...?'\nThe feeling that she was being particularly harsh on me was getting stronger.\n'Is it old maid syndrome...?'\nI didn't know Instructor Eun Ryeo's side effects, but if someone that age was unmarried, it seemed like a plausible symptom in addition to her side effects.\nWhile I was analyzing Instructor Eun Ryeo's symptoms by channeling my inner Physician Seo, Ju Seo-yeon answered boldly.\n\"I'm planning to become Young Master Il-mok's maid after completing the Hall of the Demonic Way anyway, so wouldn't it be proper to keep calling you Young Master here too?\"\n\"...Do you really think that makes sense?\"\n\"Yes, Instructor!\"\nLooking at Ju Seo-yeon's bright, sparkling eyes as she answered, Instructor Eun Ryeo sighed and turned her head away.\n\".......\"\nIt seemed even old maid syndrome couldn't handle sasaeng fans.\n'Yeah, I really need to escape quickly.'\nMy desire to leave this terrible hell grew even stronger.\nNaturally, my gaze turned toward the hall where the Meditation Club was active.\nIt wasn't just because I missed that place.\n'I hope you're keeping a good watch?'\nIt was because someone who had snuck into the Hall of the Demonic Way today was there.",

    "content": "Chapter 133: An Unwanted Conclusion (1)\nThe next afternoon.\nHall Master Yeom Ga-hwi stepped out of his residence and began walking through the grounds.\nSome disciples were huddled in the lecture halls, getting drilled on doctrine, while others were sweating it out in the training grounds, working on their external arts and martial techniques.\nIt was a sight that should have been heartening, but Yeom Ga-hwi’s face remained as impassive as ever as he surveyed the instructors teaching their charges.\nAfter making his rounds through the Hall, he spotted someone walking toward him from the opposite direction.\n\"Greetings, Hall Master.\"\nIt must've been a break period, because Ma Do-young, who'd been heading somewhere, stopped to bow properly and offer his respects.\n\"Busy, I see. Instructor Ma.\"\n“Hahaha. I was just thinking of preparing a bit for tomorrow’s lesson.”\nYeom Ga-hwi nodded at his response.\n\"Good to see you being diligent. Honestly, I was a little worried at first.\"\n“…I can only apologize for showing you such an unsightly side of myself.\"\nMa Do-young's face flushed slightly as he bowed his head. Those early days when he'd been completely outmaneuvered by Il-mok still burned like a brand of shame.\n\"Being an instructor isn't as easy as it looks, so I understand. The other instructors went through the same thing when they started.\"\n\"I won't let something like that happen again.\"\n\"I'll hold you to that.\"\nWith his usual expressionless face, Yeom Ga-hwi wrapped up the conversation with a nod and turned away without ceremony.\nMa Do-young watched his retreating figure for a moment before continuing on his way.\nOnce Ma Do-young's presence had faded, Yeom Ga-hwi casually glanced back over his shoulder.\n‘Hmm. He said it was about a year ago that he overcame Extremity thanks to Disciple Il-mok. It seems he’s made considerable progress in that time.’\nHis gaze was fixed on the path where Ma Do-young had just disappeared, more precisely, on someone invisible who was now following that same route after Ma Do-young had passed.\nEven Yeom Ga-hwi, who had mastered the supreme demonic art Asura Blood Fist to the Transcendence level, could only sense this presence when it got close enough.\nThis level of stealth technique was incredible. That person had trained in arts specialized for concealment and assassination, to the point that none of the instructors would be able to detect him.\nNot even Chu Il-hwan, the former Head Instructor, or Cha Eun-young, the Senior Instructor could handle this.\n‘The Vice Hall Master is going to be a problem.’\nStroking his beard with his calloused hand, Yeom Ga-hwi mulled this over.\nIt wasn't that there was anything particularly suspicious about the Vice Hall Master. It's just that to carry out the Heavenly Demon's sacred command, he couldn't afford to trust anyone.\nSecrets always leaked when too many people knew them. Only Yeom Ga-hwi himself, Il-mok, and Physician Seo Jae-pil knew about this man's infiltration.\n‘I can only hope we can conclude this matter before the Vice Hall Master notices.’\nThe thought brought an unusually faint smile to Yeom Ga-hwi's face.\n‘I’ve changed, too.’\nBack when he was the leader of the combat unit, he'd lived up to his nickname as the Fist Demon by fighting on the front lines himself. Just sitting around waiting for someone else to handle things had never sat right with him.\nBut after working as the Hall Master of the Hall of the Demonic Way, delegating tasks to instructors and taking on a supervisory role, he'd gotten used to assigning jobs and waiting for results.\n‘This, too, must be the Supreme One's will as well.’\nYeom Ga-hwi believed that the great Heavenly Demon always had profound intentions that ordinary people couldn't fathom.\nEarly the next morning.\nWhile everyone at the Hall of the Demonic Way was getting ready for the morning lessons, there was one place that was actually pretty quiet because everyone else was so busy.\n\"Hmm.\"\nPhysician Seo Jae-pil made a curious sound and suddenly spoke to thin air.\n\"That's some incredible stealth technique. Honestly, I can't even tell if you're actually here right now.\"\nBut even after his little monologue, nothing seemed to change in the medical office.\n\"......\"\nLooking a bit embarrassed, Seo Jae-pil scratched his head and sat down at his desk.\nThe moment he did, a shadow in the corner of the room began to expand its territory, coalescing into a human-like form.\n“My apologies. I just wanted to check the area in case anyone had tailed you here.\"\n“Ah. I must have been too careless. I’ll be more careful from now on. Hahaha.”\nSeo Jae-pil gave an awkward laugh and placed something he'd brought on the table.\n\"I brought breakfast. Let's share it.\"\nIt was a single portion of food he'd grabbed from the dining hall. The black silhouette that had approached the table took just a tiny amount.\n“Will that truly be enough?”\n\"If I eat too much, there's a risk of giving off signals while I'm moving around.\"\nSeo Jae-pil looked at the shadow with a pitying expression.\nIt had already been three days since this man had snuck into the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nSince he'd obviously infiltrated the place secretly, there wasn't anywhere in the hall that was officially available to him.\nSo he often came here to eat with Seo Jae-pil or catch some sleep.\n“You’ve only been sleeping for an hour or two a day at most. This truly is a battle of endurance.”\nTo prepare for the possibility of being discovered, he always woke up earlier than everyone else and would only return here to sleep after his target, Ma Do-yeong, had gone to bed.\n“Thanks to my time with the Dark Shadow Pavilion, I’m quite used to it. Frankly, having a place to rest for even an hour or two a day is a comfort.”\nDespite his matter-of-fact response, Seo Jae-pil wasn't really reassured.\nHe knew all too well about this man's side effects and symptoms.\n\"Sleep deprivation and malnutrition are quite detrimental to mental health. Are you having any negative thoughts?\"\nSeo Jae-pil asked as a physician, but the answer was unexpected.\n“Far from having negative thoughts, I feel absolutely wonderful.”\n\"???\"\n“I always felt sorry for only ever receiving help from my youngest brother. The thought that I was a pathetic older brother often crossed my mind. Of course, my youngest brother always consoled me, but isn’t it pathetic for an older brother to be consoled by his younger brother?”\nWhen Seo Jae-pil just nodded calmly with his physician's poker face, the man answered his own question.\n\"In that sense, this job is incredibly rewarding. It might be strange to say, but it’s as rewarding as carrying out our great Master’s commands.”\n\"You're truly reliable, Third Young Master.\"\n\"Haha, I haven't even gotten results yet. There's no need to call me reliable.”\nDespite his words, the shadow's expression showed a strange kind of joy. Seo Wan-pyeong turned his head to look somewhere in the distance, toward the training ground where his surveillance target Ma Do-young and his precious youngest brother Il-mok would be heading soon.\n\"I won't let my youngest brother down. Even if I have to stay up for several more nights and go hungry, I'll definitely catch the bastards who are targeting him.\"\nIt was a display of willpower uncharacteristic of a man who suffered from paranoia. Seeing this, Seo Jae-pil nodded and thought to himself, ‘This is a great opportunity to study how malnutrition and sleep deprivation affect paranoid delusions.’\nSeo Jae-pil. He was a man worthy to be called a mad scientist.\nA few days later.\nChanges came to the Hall of the Demonic Way. The second-year disciples were leaving again for their practical training.\nWith twenty of the forty disciples gone and half the instructors gone as well, an empty atmosphere began to settle over the Hall.\n\"Greetings, Vice Hall Master.\"\nThe night after the second year departed, Ma Do-yeong was summoned to the Vice Hall Master's chambers.\nA common summons.\nWith the seventh exam coming up in ten days, this was the time when instructors were coming and going from the Vice Hall Master's quarters one by one.\n\"I hear the upcoming exam will be individual matches?\"\n\"That's correct.\"\nAnswering the Vice Hall Master's question, Ma Do-young wondered if he'd really been called here as an 'instructor' this time.\nBut the Vice Hall Master's next words almost made Ma Do-young visibly flinch.\n\"I'm thinking we should make our move during this opportunity.\"\nMa Do-young, who had already shown disappointing results several times, forced himself to maintain his composure through sheer willpower and asked back, \"Doesn't this feel a bit rushed?\"\n\"Having second thoughts?\"\n“…Killing him is something I could have done at any time, even during club hours. The most important thing is not to leave any evidence, is it not?”\n\"Don't worry about that.\"\nYu Geuk's characteristically cold response made Ma Do-young ask as calmly as he could manage, \"Do you have some kind of plan?\" The most update n0vels are published on novel⁂fire.net\nOf course, there was a plan. A plan to get rid of not just the Eighth Young Master, but Ma Do-young standing right in front of him as well.\nBut he couldn't reveal all of that.\nYu Geuk was about to explain only the method for Ma Do-young to kill Il-mok, keeping the rest of the plan hidden.\n\"......\"\nBut for some reason, Yu Geuk closed his mouth and frowned.\nJust as Ma Do-young was about to say something, Yu Geuk suddenly stopped mid-explanation—\n\"Vice Ha—\"\nWhoosh!!\nYu Geuk's blade had been drawn and sliced through the air in an instant.\n\"!?\"\nShocked, Ma Do-young moved to draw his sword from his waist, but he was a step too slow.\nThe Saber Qi infused with cold demonic e energy that erupted from Yu Geuk's blade flashed past Ma Do-young in an instant.\nSlash!\nClang!\nThe sound of something being cut followed by the ring of metal echoed one after another.\nMa Do-young, who'd finally managed to draw his sword, felt something was off and turned his head.\nWhat he saw was the wall of the Vice Hall Master's quarters pierced by Saber Qi.\n\"!!!\"\nAnd through that gap, a human-shaped shadow was writhing.\n‘Fuck!’\nOnly then did Ma Do-young realize that someone had been eavesdropping on their conversation.\nYu Geuk, who'd instantly launched himself forward, was slashing through the entire wall of the residence as he swung his blade at that shadow.\nCrash!\nThud!\nThe wall damaged by Yu Geuk's blade collapsed.\n\"Die.\"\nYu Geuk's saber, having instantly burst out of the residence, traced a pale trajectory through the air.\n‘Shit.’\nHaving lost the initiative, Seo Wan-pyeong began getting pushed back one-sidedly.\nNo, losing the initiative wasn't the only problem. Yu Geuk's level was two or three stages above Seo Wan-pyeong's to begin with.\nEven though he'd mastered the Shadowless Fourteen Moves, specialized in assassination and stealth, he'd still been discovered.\nOn top of that—\n‘Maybe I should've eaten a bit more today.’\nIt had already been over seven weeks since Seo Wan-pyeong started tailing Ma Do-young.\nThe accumulated malnutrition and sleep deprivation made it impossible for him to display his true abilities.\nCold energy penetrated through his sword as it clashed with Yu Geuk's blade, and the strikes he couldn't block or dodge slashed his skin, adding more wounds.\nSince the attacks carried cold demonic energy, blood wasn't flowing from the cuts.\nInstead, the cold energy was seeping into the wounds, causing frostbite.\nIf he accumulated just a few more injuries like this, his body would become sluggish, making it even harder to block or evade.\n“I’m joining in!”\nTo make matters worse, Ma Do-yeong, having grasped the situation, was charging through the hole in the wall that Yu Geuk had created. It was truly a life-or-death crisis.\n‘Heh.’\nBut for some reason, a satisfied smile was spreading across Seo Wan-pyeong's lips.\n‘ This time for sure, I'm glad I can finally help my youngest brother.’",

    "content": "Chapter 134: An Unwanted Conclusion (2)\nThat grin must have really pissed him off, because Yu Geuk's ice-cold expression finally cracked just a little.\nThe kind of crack that screamed pure irritation.\nAt the same time, massive amounts of chilling demonic energy began gathering around Yu Geuk's saber.\n'This is a bit rushed, but I don't have a choice.'\nThe blade, now loaded with freezing energy, came flying straight at Seo Wan-pyeong, ready to cut him clean in half.\n'...Ice arts really are a pain in the ass.'\nSeo Wan-pyeong's smile vanished as he gritted his teeth and desperately pulled up every bit of internal energy from his dantian.\nHis body had already gone sluggish from all that cold energy that had seeped in. There was no way he could dodge something that dangerous-looking with footwork alone.\n\"Hup!\"\nTrue to its assassination-focused nature, a translucent aura wrapped around Seo Wan-pyeong's sword.\nBOOM!!!\nThe moment the blade met the sword, cold energy exploded outward like a massive iceberg bursting apart, creating a thunderous roar.\nSeo Wan-pyeong was launched backward through the steam cloud that formed from the explosion, flying a full 3 meters before he could barely manage to stop himself.\n\"Cough...\"\nHe immediately coughed up a mouthful of blood. The impact had been brutal—not only was he spitting blood, but his eyes were completely bloodshot too.\nBut then...\n\"Heh heh heh.\"\nEven with bloodshot eyes and blood trickling from his mouth, Seo Wan-pyeong was grinning again.\nIt wasn't like he'd gone crazy from internal injuries or anything.\nThe thing was, Yu Geuk—who'd just dealt him some serious internal damage—looked even more irritated than before.\n\"What's happening, Vice Hall Master?!\"\n\"Who the hell is that guy?!\"\nThe noise and energy waves from their clash had drawn the instructors and disciples of the Hall of the Demonic Way running over.\nSeo Wan-pyeong had been counting on this exact thing happening. In his mind, his mission was already a success.\nOn the flip side, Yu Geuk knew this would happen too, which is why he tried to kill Seo Wan-pyeong as fast as possible. Even going so far as to force out a lethal technique.\nNormally, Yu Geuk preferred to slowly pressure his opponents with cold energy, then unleash a devastating attack once their bodies were completely frozen stiff.\n'...Now I can only pray that the Third Young Master didn't overhear our conversation.'\nThough they had only exchanged a few blows, Yu Geuk had belatedly recognized his opponent’s identity in the process of their clash.\nThat's exactly why he wanted to finish off the Third Young Master even faster.\nIf he'd killed him before the others arrived, he could've made excuses about mistaking him for an intruder who'd snuck into the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nBut now, with everyone watching? That was dangerous territory.\n\"There was an intruder!\"\nYu Geuk tried to get ahead of the story before the injured Third Young Master could speak.\n\"Hall Master, that bastard is one of the rats targeting my youngest brother!\"\nBut Seo Wan-pyeong, with an expression of pure joy that didn't match his battered face, shouted out while spitting blood.\nYeom Ga-hwi, who'd arrived at the scene with the other instructors, stepped forward and asked, \"Are you certain?\"\n\"I heard it with my own ears! He's giving orders to kill my youngest brother during the test ten days from now!\"\nAt Seo Wan-pyeong's declaration, Yu Geuk replied with an icy expression, \"Hall Master, the Third Young Master is an intruder who barged into the Hall of the Demonic Way without permission before he's even a disciple of the Supreme One. Are you really going to believe his accusations?\"\nYeom Ga-hwi looked at him with a deadpan expression.\n“My apologies, but I already knew. I knew the Third Young Master’s entry on the Hall.\"\nYu Geuk almost ground his teeth without thinking.\n'...So that's how it was.'\nThe moment he'd realized that the little rat eavesdropping on their conversation was the Third Young Master, Yu Geuk had already suspected something was amiss.\nBut he couldn't just back down now.\n\"Are you trying to frame me like this, Hall Master?\"\nYu Geuk decided to play this off as some kind of internal power struggle within the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nWith all the instructors, assistant instructors, and disciples watching, he figured he could at least buy some time. The most update n0vels are published on novel[f]ire.net\nBut he'd forgotten something important.\nHe'd been looking at Yeom Ga-hwi as just the 'Hall Master' for so long that he'd completely forgotten what kind of person Yeom Ga-hwi had been back when he was called the 'Fist Demon.'\nLooking at Yu Geuk playing the victim, Yeom Ga-hwi spoke for the last time.\n\"If you want to play childish word games, go find someone else.\"\nBy the time the word 'else' hit Yu Geuk's ears...\nBOOM!!!\nThe ground where Yeom Ga-hwi had been standing exploded.\nLeaving only an afterimage, Yeom Ga-hwi had instantly closed in on Yu Geuk and was already swinging a fist charged with crimson energy.\nBut Yu Geuk had been somewhat prepared too. He quickly swung his cold energy-wrapped blade to block that punch.\nClang!\nA weird metallic sound rang out—far too strange for just metal hitting flesh.\nClang! Clang!\nA rapid succession of impact sounds and shockwaves echoed out.\n\"Third Brother! Are you alright?\"\nIl-mok, who'd come running at full speed the moment he heard the commotion, immediately checked on Seo Wan-pyeong's condition.\n\"Hmm. I'm fine, don't worry.\"\nMaybe because he'd successfully carried out what his precious youngest brother had asked of him, Seo Wan-pyeong tried to look dependable and spoke with a confident expression.\n'...Saying that when you look like that.'\nOf course, with blood flowing from his mouth and his eyes completely bloodshot, he just looked pitiful rather than cool.\n\"Leave the rest to the Hall Master and me. For now, focus on circulating your energy. I'll stand guard. You did well, Third Brother.\"\n\"Right. I'll trust my little brother.\"\nSeo Wan-pyeong, still trying to maintain that dependable image until the end, endured the pain from his internal injuries and the agony of the cold energy that had penetrated throughout his body, then sat cross-legged in meditation.\nOnce Il-mok confirmed that Seo Wan-pyeong had started his meditation, he quickly sent a telepathic message to someone.\n—Instructor Eun Ryeo, please stop Instructor Ma.\nEun Ryeo, who'd arrived at the scene and was watching the situation unfold, looked puzzled.\n—Do you know what's going on here, Disciple Il-mok?\n—I don't have time to explain the details. Instructor Ma might try to kill himself, so you need to stop him!\n—!?\nHis voice transmission brought a look of confusion to Eun Ryeo’s face but only briefly.\nShe was also a martial artist of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, so she wasn't naive enough to just stand around panicking in an urgent situation like this.\n'Since he asked me to prevent suicide, I just need to stay near Instructor Ma and keep watch.'\nDeciding to hide near Ma Do-yeong and observe the situation, she carefully deployed stealth techniques and quietly approached him.\nWith people continuously gathering at the scene, there was almost no chance Ma Do-yeong would notice her using stealth techniques.\nNot unless he had been keeping a close eye on her from the beginning.\nAnd right now, Ma Do-yeong didn't have the luxury of watching Eun Ryeo.\nHe was frantically turning his head this way and that, trying to assess the situation with a face full of complex emotions.\n'Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Where did things start going wrong?'\nIt seemed like everyone from the Hall of the Demonic Way had gathered now, with dozens of people surrounding them.\nBOOM!\nIn the center, the Hall Master and Vice Hall Master kept clashing, creating explosive sounds and energy waves.\nIn the midst of all this, Ma Do-yeong was wrestling with just one thought.\n'Should I help the Vice Hall Master kill the Hall Master? Or should I just kill myself?'\nIf he got caught here, there was a risk that both he and the Vice Hall Master might expose 'that person's' identity. In that case, suicide might be the right choice.\nOn the other hand, if he attacked the Hall Master, there might be at least some chance of survival. But suicide was just death, and then everything would be over.\nThe scales that had been wavering endlessly in that split second finally tipped to one side.\n'Too many people have already gathered. Even if we miraculously kill the Hall Master, there's no way out.'\nHaving made his decision, Ma Do-yeong drew his sword and brought it down toward his own heart.\n\"Urk!?\"\nBut the pain came from somewhere else, not his heart.\nThe moment he'd made his move, Eun Ryeo had instantly emerged from stealth and struck his pressure points.\nMa Do-yeong, who'd been lost in deep thought, hadn't noticed her approach even when she got right next to him.\nHaving stopped Ma Do-yeong's suicide attempt, Eun Ryeo looked toward Il-mok with an expression like she'd seen a ghost.\n'How the hell did he know this guy would try to kill himself?'\nUnaware of Eun Ryeo's thoughts, Il-mok was nodding with an 'I knew it' expression.\nHe could make this prediction because he'd been burned by similar experiences several times before.\n'Either try to take me hostage, or commit suicide. Those were the only two options.'\nIl-mok shouted toward Yeom Ga-hwi, who was engaged in fierce combat with Yu Geuk.\n\"Hall Master!! Ma Do-yeong has been subdued!\"\nThe moment that shout ended...\nBOOM!\nA massive explosion roared, and Yu Geuk's body was sent flying backward.\nWith blood at the corner of his mouth, Yu Geuk wore an unusually desperate expression as he swung his blade repeatedly in the air, sending blade energy flying toward Yeom Ga-hwi.\nWatching the blade energy coming at him, Yeom Ga-hwi took a punching stance with his usual deadpan expression.\nAt the same time, crimson energy flowed throughout his entire body, taking the form of three heads and six arms.\nBOOM!!!\nAs if the punching motion had been skipped entirely, six crimson trajectories were suddenly carved through the air.\n'Crazy... he really looks like a damn Asura.'\nIl-mok, who'd already been unconscious when Yeom Ga-hwi had subdued Chu Il-hwan, was seeing Yeom Ga-hwi's martial arts for the first time.\nThe blood-colored fist energy Yeom Ga-hwi had launched easily shattered Yu Geuk's blade energy.\nWhoooosh!\nThe remaining cluster of fist energy, still with power left, flew straight toward Yu Geuk.\nYu Geuk, who'd been trying to buy time with blade energy to set up a big technique, abandoned forming his energy and just threw his body aside.\nBOOM!\nSix explosions went off with barely any time between them.\nYeom Ga-hwi, who'd already deployed his lightness skill, had closed in right next to Yu Geuk, who'd desperately thrown himself aside, and swung his fist.\nBOOM!!!\nOnce again, Yu Geuk and Yeom Ga-hwi were exchanging blade and fists at close range, their blade and fists clashing, creating a continuous roar as the pale-blue cold energy and blood-red energy collided.\nIt was a battle between two absolute masters of a different caliber.\nIl-mok was watching that battle without blinking even once, as if he didn't want to miss a single tiny movement or detailed use of energy, and he was thinking.\n'No.'\nHe wanted to stop watching.\nBut his body had all its nerves on edge, completely focused on the fight, and even his sixth sense — his energy perception — was razor sharp.\nMaybe it was because he'd reached a certain level now.\n'Stop!!'\nHe couldn't read every move in the battle between the two masters, but little by little, insight filled the gaps between his knowledge, and he was beginning to understand the subtleties within the ongoing fight.\n—Look at that lightning-fast fist! That's how you properly use speed!\n—Do you see that saber technique? That's the true essence of stillness within motion!\nIn one corner of his mind, that damn Demonic Art was making a racket.\n—What are you doing?! Hurry up and draw your sword and swing it! Are you going to miss this opportunity!!\nIn the midst of this flood of enlightening insights rushing in like a tide...\n'Shut the fuck up!!'\nIl-mok was struggling with all his might not to draw his sword.\nHe was, quite possibly, the first man in the history of the martial world to reject enlightenment.",

    "content": "Chapter 135: An Unwanted Conclusion (3)\nAs Il-mok stood frozen as if his feet were nailed to the floor, his arms twitching, Yeom Ga-hwi’s blood-red energy and Yu Geuk’s pale yin qi clashed ceaselessly. At a glance, the scene didn't look much different from the beginning of the fight, but there was a significant difference. Sweat was now beading on Yu Geuk’s forehead, and blood was slowly trickling from the corner of his mouth.\nThe ultimate goal of this whole mess was to find the hidden master back at headquarters.\nYu Geuk and Ma Do-yeong weren't enemies to kill, they were targets to capture and interrogate.\nThat's why Yeom Ga-hwi wasn't going all out. He had to be ready in case Ma Do-yeong tried to kill himself or escape.\nBut now that Il-mok's quick thinking had subdued Ma Do-yeong...\n\"Hup!\"\nThere was no reason for Yeom Ga-hwi to hold back anymore.\nWhether it was because of accumulated internal injuries or other factors, Yu Geuk failed to block all of Yeom Ga-hwi's wave-like assault, and his blade wavered for just a split second.\nThwack!\nYeom Ga-hwi's right fist shot out instantly, slamming into Yu Geuk's side.\nThat single blow made a mouthful of blood burst from Yu Geuk's lips, which had already been leaking blood.\nBut even then, Yu Geuk didn't let out a single groan. He just swung his blade straight at Yeom Ga-hwi's neck.\nSeeing this, Yeom Ga-hwi spoke for the first time since the fight began.\n\"Excellent!\"\nYu Geuk's attitude—trading minor wounds for a kill—was truly befitting a warrior of the great Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nOf course, Yeom Ga-hwi wasn't about to offer his neck along with the praise.\nGrab.\nAs if he'd anticipated the move, Yeom Ga-hwi stretched out his left hand and caught Yu Geuk's right hand as it swung the blade.\nHaving neutralized his opponent's weapon, Yeom Ga-hwi swung his right arm again—the same one that had struck Yu Geuk's side.\nPapapapak!\nOpening his fist, he rapidly jabbed five of Yu Geuk's pressure points with his fingers in succession.\nThud.\nWhen Yeom Ga-hwi released Yu Geuk's right arm, his body crumpled like rotten straw.\n'Phew. My apologies, Lord of Ten Thousand Demons, but direct action really suits my temperament better.'\nHe thought he'd gotten used to his position as Hall Master, but after actually fighting after a long time, this definitely felt more like his style.\nWith a somewhat refreshed expression, Yeom Ga-hwi looked down at the fallen Yu Geuk.\n'How did a warrior of this caliber end up as a mere minion?'\nAs Yeom Ga-hwi stroked his beard with a blood-stained fist, mulling over that thought—\n\"Phew.\"\nIl-mok let out a deep sigh.\n'Well done, Il-mok!'\nHe didn't want to spare himself any praise.\nHe had endured the feast of enlightenment and resisted drawing his sword until the very end. He couldn’t have been prouder.\n'How dare some pathetic scrap of Demonic Art try to take over its master’s body!'\nHe wanted to gleefully give the middle finger to that other self, who was grinding his teeth in frustration, and mock him to his heart's content.\nBut now wasn't the time for that.\n\"Instructors, lead all the officials back to the Black Dragon Pavilion!\"\nWhen Yeom Ga-hwi shouted this after subduing Yu Geuk, the instructors stepped forward and began cleaning up the scene.\n\"Phew.\"\nJust then, Seo Wan-pyeong, who had been concentrating on circulating his energy, also opened his eyes with a deep breath.\n\"Are you alright, Third Brother?\"\n\"The urgent fire's been put out, so don't worry. The situation's pressing, so let's finish tidying up first and then start proper treatment.\"\nSeo Wan-pyeong tried to look dependable as always as he got to his feet.\n\"Sorry for the late greeting, Hall Master.\"\nWhen the Hall Master approached, carrying the unconscious Yu Geuk and Ma Do-yeong, Seo Wan-pyeong quickly clasped his hands and bowed.\n\"Given the situation, it couldn't be helped.\"\nThe Hall Master replied and then turned his gaze to Il-mok.\n\"Disciple Il-mok.\"\n\"Yes, Hall Master.\"\n\"You should also return to the Black Dragon Pavilion and rest. We'll handle the interrogation.\"\nA student was still a student. Yeom Ga-hwi believed it was their duty to handle the cleanup. Seeing that stubborn old man's look on his face, Il-mok had a gut feeling that persuasion would be useless.\n\"I'll trust you and wait.\"\nHe watched the backs of Yeom Ga-hwi and Seo Wan-pyeong heading somewhere with their two captives, along with Physician Seo Jae-pil.\n'Phew. At least we caught two of them, so they'll handle the rest. Plus, we have that thing too.'\nShaking off any lingering attachment, Il-mok turned and headed toward the Black Dragon Pavilion, but then hesitated.\n'Feels like I'm forgetting something?'\nBut only briefly. Il-mok sighed and started walking again.\n'Better not overthink it and trigger another round of side effects.'\nEven earlier, it was lucky that the fight between the Hall Master and the Vice Hall Master ended quickly. Otherwise, he’d gone berserk.\nStep. Step.\nWalking toward the Black Dragon Pavilion, Il-mok thought about how he just wanted to rest peacefully without any worries for a while.\nYu Geuk awoke to an excruciating pain as if his whole body was being torn apart.\nBut even suffering such agony, he didn't let out a single groan. He just frowned slightly.\nThe first thing he realized upon regaining consciousness was that his pressure points had been sealed.\nNot a single bit of his internal energy would move as he willed, and his body was the same. He couldn't even twitch a finger.\nIt was like sleep paralysis, where his mind was awake but his body was immobile.\nThe second thing he realized was that he was bound.\nLooking down with his head half-lowered, he could see iron chains binding his body.\n'Tsk.'\nOnly then did Yu Geuk remember being subdued by the Hall Master. Yu Geuk clicked his tongue internally.\n\"Looks like you're awake.\"\nAt the same time, the voice of the man who'd subdued him reached his ears.\n\"I'll release your pressure points.\"\nThen came the voice of the Third Young Master, who could be called the source of this whole mess. Someone's hand lifted his chin.\nOnly then could Yu Geuk realize that it was the Third Young Master’s.\nThe Third Young Master carefully moved his hands to release Yu Geuk's pressure points. But he never let go of the hand gripping his jaw.\nAs if ready to act the moment he showed signs of trying to kill himself.\n\"Why are you doing this, Hall Master?\"\nThose were the first words Yu Geuk spoke after his pressure points were released. His pronunciation was slurred with the Third Young Master gripping his chin, but it wasn't hard to understand.\n\"Planning to play dumb to the end?\"\n\"...Did I really displease you that much?\"\nYu Geuk acted as if this were some kind of political struggle within the Hall of the Demonic Way.\n“It seems it was a good thing we brought that thing.\"\nWhen the Hall Master shook his head once and said this, Physician Seo Jae-pil approached Yu Geuk with something in his hand.\nSeo Jae-pil shoved something like finely ground medicinal powder into Yu Geuk's mouth, and Seo Wan-pyeong, who was gripping Yu Geuk's chin, moved his jaw and throat to force him to swallow.\n\"Let's see if you say the same thing after eating that.\"\nYu Geuk glared at the Hall Master with eyes blazing with killing intent after being forced to consume something.\n\"Are you trying to force a confession by poisoning me?\"\nBut the answer that came back was unexpected.\n\"What we fed you is indeed a poison, but you won't die from eating that much. You'll probably be fine in an hour or two.\"\n\"???\"\nWhile Yu Geuk felt something was off about the Demonic Arts Hall Master's words—\n\"???\"\nYu Geuk belatedly noticed something was wrong.\nHis consciousness gradually began to grow hazy, and the figures of Yeom Ga-hwi, Seo Jae-pil, and Seo Wan-pyeong before his eyes started twisting strangely.\nThe item Il-mok had requested from the Heavenly Demon through Seo Jae-pil.\nThe very thing that Seo Jae-pil had once proposed using as treatment for mental illness, but Il-mok had fiercely opposed, causing the plan to fall through.\nIt was drugs.\nIl-mok had been the one to propose using it only as a painkiller due to its addictive and dangerous nature, but ironically, Il-mok had now requested it for a different purpose.\nAnd that other purpose was as a truth serum.\nOf course, he hadn't requested it carelessly. Using drugs as a truth serum was extremely dangerous. Dıscover more novels at NoveI★Fire.net\nThe side effects and addiction didn't disappear just because you used them as a truth serum.\nIf they used truth serum on every suspect to catch criminals, the entire Demonic Cult would soon become a den of drug addicts.\nOn top of that, half of what someone said while high on drugs was basically nonsense, like a patient under anaesthesia talking in their sleep.\nBut the accomplices they'd caught this time were definite criminals, and there were several of them.\nThey could cross-verify nonsense against real confessions, and since they were actual criminals, there was no risk of creating innocent drug addicts.\nIl-mok had requested that drugs be used as truth serum only when there were comparison groups and 'definite criminals,' and the Heavenly Demon had also given permission only under such conditions.\nLate at night.\nWhile the interrogation of Yu Geuk and Ma Do-yeong was underway—\n\"Snore. Snooore.\"\nIl-mok, who had been dozing and snoring, suddenly opened his eyes.\nWhat appeared in his vision was something silver glinting in the darkness.\n\"!!!\"\nIl-mok, who had awakened to faint killing intent, threw his body aside to avoid the blade plunging toward him.\nSlash.\nThe bed where Il-mok had been lying was pierced through with an unpleasant cutting sound.\n\"Fuck.\"\nA curse slipped out of Il-mok's mouth as he barely avoided the surprise attack.\n'Thanks to Third Brother, my body automatically reacts to night attacks now.'\nBut that didn't mean the one who attacked him was Seo Wan-pyeong.\n'I can't believe I forgot about this bastard.'\nIt was Jeong Gyu-seok, the instructor in charge of doctrine education and the Doctrine Research Club.\nCome to think of it, he'd originally suspected Jeong Gyu-seok and Cheok Il-so as accomplices.\nIt's just that unexpectedly, they'd caught Yu Geuk, a bigger fish than those two.\nThe reason he could tell that his current attacker was Jeong Gyu-seok and not Cheok Il-so was simple.\nThe attacker was using a blade, unlike Cheok Il-so, who used a spear.\nPlus, the body shape revealed through the black night clothes the assassin wore was a bit too lean to be Cheok Il-so's.\nCheok Il-so boasted muscles and bulk befitting a physical fitness club instructor.\n\"Tsk.\"\nWhen Il-mok dodged his first strike, the assassin clicked his tongue lightly and swung his blade wildly.\nAs Il-mok had expected, he was Jeong Gyu-seok.\nAfter the secret conversation between Yu Geuk and Ma Do-yeong was discovered by Third Young Master Seo Wan-pyeong—\nJeong Gyu-seok felt his blood run cold every single moment.\nIn the midst of this, Jeong Gyu-seok had this thought:\nEventually, his identity would be exposed as time passed anyway.\nIf so, then he’d rather—\n'I'll kill the Eighth Young Master, who's the source of all this mess, and be done with it.'\nInstead of waiting to die after being discovered while spending hellish days, wouldn't it be better to cleanly kill the source of all this trouble and then commit suicide?\nLooking at Jeong Gyu-seok's blade flying toward his neck, Il-mok was furious.\n'Fuck! Fuck!! Fuck!!!'\nIt wasn't anger at himself for not thinking about the remaining accomplice problem.\nNor was it anger about nearly dying from a surprise attack.\nIt was because—\nClang!\nIl-mok's sword was already drawn before he knew it, and he successfully blocked the assassin's strike just in time.\nWhile throwing his body aside from the first attack, Il-mok had grabbed the scabbard beside his bed.\nEven so, the reason he was angry was—\n'I should have held back just for today!!!'\nIt was because of the very fact that he'd ended up drawing his sword.\nThe lump of enlightenment he'd barely managed to shove into a corner of his mind and ignore stirred to life again.\nNo.\n—Hehehehe.\nThe damn side effect was grinning like it was saying \"screw you\" while holding the lump of enlightenment and dancing around gleefully.\nHaving experienced this countless times before, this was the most unwanted ending he'd been praying wouldn't happen again.",

    "content": "Chapter 136: The Cleanup (1)\nWhen walking down the street or maybe you're on public transportation, heading somewhere. Everyone has probably experienced that sudden, urgent signal from their body at least once.\nThe human body is weird like that.\nWhen you held it in because there was no restroom, the urge would somehow calm down like a peaceful ocean after a storm. But the moment you think you are safe, the urge will come back like a fierce tidal wave.\nThe side effects of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword were exactly like that.\nClang!\nThe enlightenment he'd been forcibly suppressing wasn't coming one by one in an orderly fashion like before.\nClang!!\nIt was hammering his brain mercilessly, like someone desperately pounding on the bathroom door when they really, really need to go.\nAnd to make matters worse...\n'Damn it!! I can't even stop!!'\nThis wasn't like earlier when he could leisurely watch the fight unfold.\nClang!!\nHe was in the middle of combat with some bastard who was trying to kill him while triggering enlightenment left and right.\nIf he didn't swing his sword like before, his head would be rolling on the ground.\nNaturally, Il-mok swung his sword to stay alive.\n—That's not it! Recall the memory from just now!\n—Faster!! Don't set your own limits!\nAnd every time he did, that damn side effect kept giving him unwanted advice.\nThanks to that, Il-mok's swordplay was getting more precise and faster with each passing moment.\nBut it wasn't getting gentler or smoother.\nYu Geuk and Yeom Ga-hwi's martial arts were a complete stranger to the concepts of flexibility and flow.\nThe enlightenment Il-mok was gaining was all about speed and precision.\nWhat was that saying? All rivers flow to the sea?\nAlthough Yeom Ga-hwi’s and Yu Geuk’s arts were fist and blade techniques…\nWhoosh!\n…the sword Il-mok swung moved with the speed of Yeom Ga-hwi’s fist.\nClang!\nAnd it moved with the same minimal, precise motions of Yu Geuk's blade.\nHowever...\nClang!\nEven while manifesting all this rushing enlightenment through his body, Il-mok was steadily being pushed back.\nNo matter how you sliced it, Jeong Gyu-seok was still an instructor despite his class being a non-combat one.\nHe might be a couple of levels below Chu Il-hwan, the former Head Instructor, but he was definitely better than Il-mok right now.\nWithout this enlightenment, Il-mok would've had to hand his body over to his Demonic Art completely, just like during Chu Il-hwan's last attack.\nThanks to the flood of enlightenment and the Demonic Art's coaching, he held out for several exchanges.\nBut after fighting in this cramped room, Il-mok figured he couldn't hold out much longer.\nCrash!!\nHe let the force of his opponent's blade carry him and flew straight toward the window.\nThe wooden and paper window that Il-mok's back slammed into was torn apart and gave way.\nIl-mok sailed out into the night sky, and Jeong Gyu-seok, not missing a beat, launched himself after him and burst out into the moonlit night.\n'I feel like I've seen this before.'\nAs memories of his fight with the berserk Chu Il-hwan came flooding back...\nThe incident with the berserk Chu Il-hwan came to mind. Just as Chu Il-hwan had done, Jeong Gyu-seok, suspended in mid-air, swung his blade at Il-mok as he fell.\nWhoosh!\nHe must have unleashed quite the technique as dense waves of blade energy formed a crescent shape and flew toward Il-mok.\n'Did that Demonic Art bastard do it like this back then?'\nIn this familiar situation, Il-mok mimicked how his Demonic Art had blocked Chu Il-hwan's ultimate technique.\nIl-mok's sword, utilizing the principle of flexibility to its limit, met the dense blade energy.\nClang!\nHe deflected the energy to the side, and the recoil sent his body flying in the opposite direction.\nBut the result was quite different from last time.\nBack then, Il-mok couldn't handle the impact and coughed up blood.\nThud.\nThis time, he landed on the ground without much trouble.\n—Hahaha! Now you're finally starting to act like a human being!\nAt the sound of his other self laughing with glee, Il-mok scrunched up his face in annoyance.\nMeanwhile, Jeong Gyu-seok, who had also landed, swung his blade and charged at Il-mok.\n\"There's a fight!\"\n\"Outside!!\"\n\"Young Master Il-mok?\"\nWoken by the commotion, students began to file out of the Black Dragon Pavilion one by one.\n\"Instructor Jeong Gyu-seok?\"\nAs they came out into the moonlight, the trainees recognized Jeong Gyu-seok's exposed face.\n\"Young Master Il-mok!\"\n\"We'll join the fight!\"\n\"Young Master!\"\nPeople like Bang Mi-hwa, Dokgo Pae, and Ju Seo-yeon stepped forward to help Il-mok.\nJeong Hyeon was also there, and though she couldn't speak because of the crowd, she had already drawn her bow and was aiming at Jeong Gyu-seok.\nIl-mok desperately shouted at those trying to help him.\n\"Don't interfere!\"\nAnd Jeong Gyu-seok didn't miss that opportunity.\nIl-mok barely managed to block Jeong Gyu-seok's blade, and a pained groan escaped his lips.\n\"Ugh...\"\nHe was slightly short of breath from shouting, which left him with minor internal injuries.\nEven though Il-mok took such risks to stop the students from helping, his side effect was laughing heartily.\n—Hahaha! How dare they try to interfere when you have a chance to perfect your sword!\nIl-mok gritted his teeth at the Demonic Art’s nonsense.\n'Shut up. That wasn't why I did it.'\nWhether the Demonic Art knew his true feelings or not, the people who had stopped at Il-mok's shout started spouting their own nonsense.\n\"Indeed! Truly befitting a warrior of the Divine Cult, Young Master Il-mok!\"\n\"Hohoho. So you intended to settle this one-on-one.”\nTheir muttering made Il-mok feel like he was about to develop a heart demon.\n'These crazy bastards are being more of a hindrance than help...'\nHe appreciated their desire to help, but their involvement would only get in the way.\nNot because it would interfere with perfecting his sword, as the side effect claimed.\nThe problem was that their skill level was quite a bit lower than his or Instructor Jeong Gyu-seok's.\nIf they joined the fight carelessly, Jeong Gyu-seok might use them against Il-mok and put him in danger instead.\nThat's why Il-mok stopped them.\nBecause he was confident.\nClang!!\nNot that he was confident he could directly subdue Instructor Jeong Gyu-seok. Just that...\n\"Disciple Il-mok!!\"\n\"Instructor Jeong Gyu-seok! What the hell are you doing!?\"\nHe was confident he could hold out until other instructors arrived after hearing the commotion.\nWhoosh!\nUsing their lightness skills to leap over the disciple watching the battle, Eun Ryeo and Cheok Il-so each swung their weapons at Jeong Gyu-seok.\nWhen two instructors of similar skill level joined forces in a coordinated attack, Jeong Gyu-seok's movements became significantly shaken.\nClang!\n\"What's all this commotion!!\"\nAnd when Yeom Ga-hwi and Seo Wan-pyeong, who had been conducting interrogations, also joined them, a huge opening appeared in Jeong Gyu-seok's movements as he was forced to retreat.\nWhoosh!!\nIl-mok's instantly shot out and pierced through that opening.\n\"!!!\"\nThe eyes of Yeom Ga-hwi, who had arrived late at the scene, shook in a rare display of surprise.\n'He stole my technique in that short time?'\nThat lightning-fast sword strike clearly resembled Yeom Ga-hwi's Asura Blood Fist even though it was performed with a sword.\nAnd the moment Il-mok's sword strike reached Instructor Jeong Gyu-seok's body...\n'...Even the Vice Hall Master's saber technique.' Orıginal content can be found at NoveIꜰire.net\nA faint gasp of admiration escaped Yeom Ga-hwi's lips.\nIl-mok's final sword stopped precisely at Jeong Gyu-seok's pressure point.\nInstead of piercing or penetrating the flesh, he pressed the pressure point with his sword tip and injected energy to subdue it.\nIt was the pinnacle of precision.\nNot too much, not too little—a technique executed with truly minimal movement.\nYeom Ga-hwi, once again amazed by Il-mok's talent, stopped mid-step as he was approaching Il-mok, who had subdued Jeong Gyu-seok.\n'Now what's this...?'\nAs if reading Yeom Ga-hwi's thoughts, the students surrounding them each spoke up.\n\"...Why is he dancing?\"\n\"Is he celebrating his victory...?\"\n\"Come to think of it, he did this during the martial arts tournament too, didn't he?\"\nIl-mok, having subdued Jeong Gyu-seok, suddenly started performing a sword dance.\nThis was because the battle had ended before he could properly channel all the enlightenment that was overflowing within him.\nIt was like being cut off in the middle when something had rushed in like a storm and he couldn't release it all.\n\".......\"\nWhile everyone stared at Il-mok like he was insane...\n'Damn it. Fucking hell.'\nIl-mok had no choice but to perform his sword dance under the moonlight, his expression full of resentment.\nIt was a moonlit sword dance filled with sorrow, as if reminiscing about a departed lover.\nThe next day.\nThanks to the discovery of no fewer than three undercover agents, the Hall of the Demonic Way had its first day off since its opening.\nIt was a lucky break for Il-mok.\nHe had danced with his sword until dawn and only stopped when he was on the verge of collapse.\nIf morning classes had started again, Il-mok might have fainted during the lessons.\nBut with two instructor positions vacant and even Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi busy with interrogations, classes were impossible. So Yeom Ga-hwi ordered individual training for the day.\nHe only gave Instructors Eun Ryeo and Cheok Il-so a simple command to watch the students and make sure they didn't cause trouble.\nThanks to that, Il-mok was able to sleep after finishing his sword dance.\nDue to his cleanliness obsession, he even managed to take a bath before sleeping.\nAnyway, Il-mok, who had fallen asleep in the morning, didn't wake up until the afternoon.\nThe first place Il-mok headed after waking up was the Hall Master's quarters.\nAnd fortunately, Yeom Ga-hwi was there.\nAlong with him were Physician Seo Jae-pil and Seo Wan-pyeong.\n\"Are the interrogations finished?\"\nYeom Ga-hwi nodded with an unusually complex expression.\n\"They are.\"\n\"That seems faster than expected.\"\n\"It's thanks to that drug you and Physician Seo prepared.\"\n\"Did you cross-reference everything? More than half of what they say under that drug is nonsense or sleep talk, so verification is necessary.\"\n\"Don't worry. We only used that drug once on each of them anyway.\"\n\"???\"\nWhen Il-mok showed a puzzled look, Seo Wan-pyeong, who had been watching, spoke up instead.\n\"They already spilled most of the information the first time we used the drug, youngest. Right after that, Jeong Gyu-seok's surprise attack happened and the interrogation was temporarily halted. When we returned to resume the interrogation, both Vice Hall Master Yu Geuk and Ma Do-yeong had already given up.\"\nOnly then could Il-mok understand the situation.\n\"After that, they confessed everything on their own without needing the drug.\"\nThe Hall Master nodded at Il-mok's words and continued.\n\"Thanks to that, we also learned why the Vice Hall Master got involved. Why that man, so famous for being just and for strictly separating public and private matters, would plan such a despicable act.”\n\"???\"\nWhen Il-mok looked puzzled at this unexpected statement, the Hall Master continued.\n\"The Vice Hall Master had become a cold, rational man due to his side effects. A fine warrior who didn't pursue personal desires and devoted himself to the cult. But ironically, after he overcame Extremity and regained his true self, his forgotten greed began to grow again. He had simply been deceiving everyone all along.\"\nSeo Wan-pyeong added to the explanation.\n\"He said that after overcoming Extremity, he began to feel frustrated about being tied down to the Hall of the Demonic Way. He was confident he could rise to much higher positions, but felt that those above didn't recognize his worth. So he decided to curry favor with someone likely to become the next Cult Leader.\"\nAnd Seo Jae-pil spoke with sparkling eyes.\n\"It's truly an unusual case. What was the purpose of our Divine Cult learning Demonic Arts? Wasn't it to cultivate a strong spirit to overcome the side effects of Demonic Arts and save all living beings? But the Vice Hall Master became a fair and impartial man thanks to the side effects of his Demonic Art, and became evil after overcoming those side effects. Hahaha.\"\nOnly then could Il-mok understand why the expressions of those gathered in the Hall Master's quarters had been so complex.\nFrom the perspective of faithful believers of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, Yu Geuk's change of heart was truly a bizarre situation that went against their doctrine.\nHowever...\n'Seriously? You're all acting all serious over some bullshit like that?'\nFrom Il-mok's perspective, as someone who wasn't a faithful believer of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, this was just another load of crap.\nThere was a much more important issue remaining than Yu Geuk's change of heart.\n\"So, did you find out who Yu Geuk was trying to curry favor with?\"",

    "content": "Chapter 137: The Cleanup (2)\nDeep within the Tianshan Mountain Range lay the main headquarters of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nA little way off from the central area, there was this massive estate sprawling across the mountainside.\nInside, you'd find middle-aged and elderly martial artists either lost in quiet contemplation or buried in books. Some gathered in small groups, chatting away or playing chess to pass the time.\nThe place, which gave off an atmosphere similar to the Peach Blossom Ridge, was officially known as the Council of Elders.\nThese were men who had accumulated decades of merit in the Cult and reached a high realm, having served as vice commanders of the martial units or as high-ranking officials in various departments.\nHowever, they had ultimately failed to break through their limits, never becoming commanders or heads of their respective organizations, and had stepped down from the front lines, ceding their positions to those more outstanding than themselves.\nStill, their years of service hadn't gone unnoticed. They were given the title of \"Elder\" and treated with respect throughout the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult as the senior members they were.\nToday, the Council of Elders was about to receive some unexpected visitors.\nAs the main gates of the council suddenly swung open, the gazes of the elders, who had been enjoying their leisure alone or in groups, all turned to the entrance. Then, as one, they prostrated themselves, paying respects to the unannounced guest without a word.\n\"We greet the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons!!\"\nThe sudden arrivals were none other than the Heavenly Demon himself, along with the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master who was like his shadow, and Wi Jin-hak, the Heavenly Demon's first disciple.\nAs they bowed before the Heavenly Demon who'd shown up without any warning, the elders gathered there all had similar thoughts running through their minds.\n'What brings the Supreme One here?'\n'...I can sense presences around the perimeter walls. Something's definitely going down.'\nAs the saying goes, the back waves of the Yangtze River push the front waves (長江後浪推前浪), and these elders had indeed been pushed aside by their successors. But they were still men who had held great responsibilities. Naturally, most of them could sense the presence that had begun to envelop the council.\nThe Heavenly Demon walked past those bowing to him, heading deeper into the compound.\nNormally, he would've commanded them to rise by now.\nBut he didn't.\nCold sweat started trickling down the spines of the prostrating elders.\nTheir instincts were screaming that something was very, very wrong.\nThe Heavenly Demon, accompanied by the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master and Wi Jin-hak, strode past the elders toward the main hall at the center of the compound.\nClick.\nBefore the Heavenly Demon even reached it, the hall's doors opened, revealing several elderly figures.\nIt was the Head of Council of Elders, Deng Bi, and the others who were responsible for managing the Council of Elders.\nThe moment they stepped out, they immediately prostrated themselves just like the other elders, greeting the Heavenly Demon.\n\"We greet the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons.\"\nOnly then did the Heavenly Demon stop walking.\nBut he didn't permit them to rise. He just stood there, staring down at the Chief Elder pressed flat against the ground.\n\".......\"\nAn uncomfortable silence settled over the Council of Elders.\nStill on his knees with his head down, the Chief Elder finally spoke up.\n\"Might this lowly one ask what brings the Supreme One to this place?\"\n“I have come to ask you something.”\n“Please ask, my lord.”\nThe Chief Elder waited.\nThat's when the Heavenly Demon dropped his question.\n\"Why did you try to kill Il-mok?\"\n\"!!!\"\nThe ones who reacted to that question weren't the Chief Elder; it was the other elders nearby.\nThey couldn't help but flinch where they lay, and sweat began dripping from their foreheads onto the ground.\nIt was weird, really.\nThe Heavenly Demon hadn't even activated his Heavenly Demon Divine Arts yet. That heavy, sticky demonic energy characteristic of his technique wasn't crushing down on everyone.\nHe hadn't released any kind of aura at all, but somehow the elders were already trembling in fear.\nAfter decades of serving the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, they all knew exactly what the Heavenly Demon was truly capable of.\nIn that tense atmosphere, the Chief Elder—still unable to raise his head without permission—gave his answer.\n\"...Since you've come here personally to question me, I assume Vice Hall Master Yu Geuk has opened his mouth.\"\nThat response was basically an admission of guilt. And another chilling silence descended upon the Council of Elders.\nAll the prostrating elders didn't know what to do with themselves, and Wi Jin-hak's body began radiating intense heat as his anger flared.\nAfter all, this bastard had tried to kill his youngest brother. But even in his fury, Wi Jin-hak didn't step forward.\nIt wasn't just because he'd achieved Transcendence and could control his anger. It was because his revered master's interrogation was still ongoing.\nWhile Wi Jin-hak glared at the Chief Elder with murderous eyes from behind his master, the Chief Elder spoke again.\n“May I rise to give my answer?”\n“You may.”\nThe Heavenly Demon's tone was calm.\nNo, it sounded like he was suppressing his anger.\nThe Chief Elder slowly got to his feet.\n\"You asked why I tried to kill the Eighth Young Master?\"\n“I did.”\n\"After the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons ascends to heaven, I wanted to become the next generation's Cult Leader. Killing each other to become the Cult Leader, isn't that a long-standing tradition of our Divine Cult?\"\nMaybe because it was the answer he'd been expecting, the Heavenly Demon asked another question.\n\"Il-mok is still too young to become Cult Leader. You are trying to kill a child who isn't even aiming for that position and has nothing to do with the tradition. Are you really going to claim you didn't know that?\"\nFor some reason, the Chief Elder turned his gaze away at that question.\nIt wasn't to avoid the Heavenly Demon's eyes.\nHis gaze went to Wi Jin-hak, who was glaring at him with murderous intent.\n\"It was a decision made with the First Young Master in mind, not the Eighth.\"\nWi Jin-hak's face filled with confusion as he was suddenly brought into this.\n\"If that foolish First Young Master becomes the Cult Leader, there is no telling what disaster would befall our Divine Cult. Therefore, I only intended to first dispose of the Eighth Young Lord, who had the potential to become his greatest ally.”\nAt the Chief Elder's follow-up words, Wi Jin-hak's face turned bright red.\nIt wasn't just from anger.\n'He targeted my youngest brother because of my foolishness'\nHis anger was already through the roof, and now this bastard was poking at the inferiority complex he thought he'd overcome. For a moment, his inner demons came calling.\nBut Wi Jin-hak had already overcome the side effects of his Demonic Art and achieved Transcendence. He managed to hold back from losing control, working to subdue his inner demons, albeit barely.\nWhether he knew about his first disciple's condition or not, the Heavenly Demon addressed the Chief Elder.\n\"Sophistry. If Jin-hak truly were foolish, he wouldn't listen to Il-mok's advice, making it meaningless. On the flip side, if Jin-hak does listen to Il-mok's counsel, then the foolishness you speak of becomes irrelevant.\"\nAs he spoke, the terrifying demonic energy of the Heavenly Demon Divine Arts finally began flowing from the Heavenly Demon's body.\n\"You were simply blinded by your ambition for the Cult Leader position and tried to kill a child who would brighten our cult's future.\"\nAs the demonic energy of the Heavenly Demon Divine Arts pressed down on the entire Council of Elders, the Chief Elder—who was taking the brunt of it—managed to force words out despite the crushing pressure on his entire body.\n\"A child who would brighten the cult's future... I had no idea the Supreme One held the Eighth Young Master in such high regard.\"\n\"You witnessed the changes that child brought about in just a year and a half, yet you still don't understand? You're the one who's truly foolish beyond measure.\"\nThe Chief Elder's complexion had turned deathly pale.\nIt wasn't just from the Heavenly Demon's harsh criticism. The demonic energy was crushing him, and his internal injuries were getting worse by the second.\nBlood began trickling from the corner of the Chief Elder's mouth as he spoke.\n\"Might this foolish one make a final request?\"\n\"Speak.\"\n\"This was merely the result of my own greed blinding me. Please let your anger be satisfied with my life alone.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon seemed to consider this for a moment before nodding.\nRight after that, the amount of blood flowing from the Chief Elder's mouth increased dramatically.\nOn top of his internal injuries, he'd bitten off his own tongue to commit suicide.\nThe Chief Elder's face quickly turned pale, and everyone in the Council of Elders watched as he slowly died.\nWith excessive blood loss making even the Heavenly Demon's figure appear blurry, the Chief Elder had one final thought.\n'...Where did it all go wrong?'\nEverything had been going smoothly right up until he got involved with the Eighth Young Master.\nThat's why he couldn't understand it even more.\nHe'd clearly sent word to lay low after the series of failures, so how had his identity been exposed?\nHe'd deduced it came through the Vice Hall Master, but the Chief Elder had no way of knowing exactly what had happened at the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nTo avoid suspicion, he'd also been lying low and cutting off communication.\nBut one thing he could guess:\n'This time too, it must be something the Eighth Young Master pulled off.'\nAs he collapsed to the floor from blood loss, through his completely darkened vision, he could vaguely picture Il-mok's form.\nBut with his consciousness already fading, he couldn't continue that line of thought.\nOnly one final thought came to mind.\n'At least it can end with just my death. How fortunate.'\nWith that thought, the Chief Elder's consciousness faded away.\nThe Heavenly Demon looked down at the Chief Elder lying on the ground, blood still flowing from his mouth.\nAfter confirming that his life had completely ended, the Heavenly Demon withdrew his demonic energy and gave his command.\n\"Clean this up.\"\n“As you command!”\nThe moment the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master's response fell, the Hidden Guard warriors who had been surrounding the Council of Elders entered and began removing the Chief Elder's corpse and cleaning up the bloodstains.\nThat night.\n\"I greet my Master.\"\nWi Jin-hak, summoned by the Heavenly Demon to the Heavenly Demon Palace, prostrated himself in greeting.\n\"Rise.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon stared intently at Wi Jin-hak's face for a moment.\nSeeing the somewhat troubled expression there, the Heavenly Demon asked, \"Are the Chief Elder's words bothering you?\"\n\"...Yes, master.\" Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on NovєlFіre.net\nWi Jin-hak had considered denying it, but he answered honestly. He'd learned by now that there was no point in telling pointless lies.\nHearing his disciple's honest answer, the Heavenly Demon nodded once and said. \"Then do you also remember the answer this old man gave?\"\nThe Heavenly Demon had noticed that his first disciple had fallen into inner demons. But what he'd said to the Chief Elder wasn't something he'd made up just to comfort his disciple.\n\"Those were this old man's true feelings. Didn't Il-mok tell you as well? A leader is simply someone who must utilize talent in the right places. They do not need to be a genius themselves.”\n\"I think the same way, and I'm gradually overcoming my inner demons, Master.\"\nMaybe there was a difference between thinking something yourself and hearing it from the master you looked up to. Wi Jin-hak's face looked much more at ease as he answered.\nAnd perhaps because his first disciple's expression had relaxed a bit, the Heavenly Demon threw out an unexpected question.\n\"Then do you understand why this old man ended this matter with just the Chief Elder's life?\"\nWi Jin-hak pondered that question for a moment before carefully opening his mouth.\n\"I thought it might be to end this matter as a warning. A warning to prevent innocent young cult members from dying in the struggle for the Cult Leader position, including my youngest junior brother.\"\nIt was an answer he'd reached by recalling his master's behavior over the decades he'd observed him as a disciple.\nLike when he'd reformed the educational methods at the Hall of the Demonic Way, his Master didn't want cult members dying meaningless deaths.\n\"In the same vein, if we tracked down and punished everyone who followed the Chief Elder, we'd have to kill too many cult members.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon nodded.\n\"From Il-mok's perspective, that's the correct answer. Now, think of the answer from your position, Jin-hak.”\n\"...?\"\nWi Jin-hak looked puzzled.\nOne might have expected the Heavenly Demon to be disappointed in a disciple who couldn’t easily find the answer, but he simply looked at Wi Jin-hak with a leisurely expression, as if he was content to wait.\nSo instead of asking his master for the answer, Wi Jin-hak calmly pondered the question over and over.\nAfter quite a long silence, Wi Jin-hak carefully spoke up.\n“I believe it might be to test me.”\n\"A test... Why do you think that?\"\nAt his master's neutral reaction, Wi Jin-hak explained the reasoning he'd spent so long working through.\n\"The Chief Elder said his ultimate goal was to push me aside. Therefore, if we punished everyone connected to the Chief Elder, it could mean eliminating all those who were targeting me. If that happened, I'd have a very high chance of ascending to the next Cult Leader position without anyone's interference. To prevent this, you ended the matter with just the Chief Elder's life—that's what I believe.\"\nSurprisingly, the Heavenly Demon nodded at Wi Jin-hak's reasoning.\nIt meant he'd deliberately left alive those who were targeting his first disciple.",

    "content": "Chapter 138: The Cleanup (3)\nThe Heavenly Demon spoke with his usual calm tone.\n\"If you ascend to the position of Cult Leader in that manner, your legitimacy will be seriously flawed. For it would not be you who became the leader, but this old man who made you so.”\nThe succession battle for the Cult Leader position that followed each Heavenly Demon's ascension was a tradition that had been carried on in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult for hundreds of years.\nBefore being the Heavenly Demon—no, precisely because he was the Heavenly Demon, he could not simply disregard the long-standing traditions of the Cult.\nWasn't there a saying about matching words with actions and leading by example?\nAs both the leader and an object of faith, he had to be the first to follow the doctrine, so that the believers would follow it even more faithfully. That's what the Heavenly Demon believed.\nOf course, there were doctrines within the cult that were contradictory or could be interpreted differently depending on one's perspective.\nSuch doctrines were often decided based on how the current Cult Leader or Heavenly Demon chose to interpret them.\nThat's why the Heavenly Demon had also reformed the Hall of the Demonic Way and accepted many of Il-mok's reform proposals.\nEven before becoming the Heavenly Demon, he had felt such regret.\nDespite learning Demonic Arts to save the common people, too many believers were dying meaninglessly in the name of the cult's traditions.\nIf only they hadn't died like that, the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult could have grown stronger, and then they could have eliminated more evildoers and saved more people.\nBut even for a Heavenly Demon like him, there were doctrines and traditions he did not dare to deny or break.\nSpecifically, the doctrine that the most outstanding person should become the Cult Leader, and the succession battle tradition that derived from it.\nThat's why the Heavenly Demon had personally gone to the Council of Elders and announced the Chief Elder's crimes and punishment in front of countless elders when he could simply use his position to kill him without any questions or explanations needed.\nIt was to issue a warning that he wouldn't stand for the foolishness of trying to kill the cult's future talents just because they were potential competitors, and to emphasize that this incident was purely about protecting Il-mok and others who had nothing to do with the Cult Leader selection.\n\"Right now, many will think this old man is overprotecting his disciples. But as time passes, won't they realize? This old man only protects Il-mok and the young believers. So you need to prepare for that time.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon spoke matter-of-factly.\nHe didn't ask if his actions seemed cold-hearted and cruel.\nBefore being master and disciple, it was simply the natural judgment as members of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nAnd hearing his master's cold explanation, Wi Jin-hak took a firm stance and bowed with a resolute expression.\n“This disciple will never disappoint you, Master.”\nAs a devout follower who had also dedicated decades of his life to the Cult, he fully understood his master’s intentions. Far from feeling it was cruel, Wi Jin-hak was convinced that his master was testing him because he believed in him.\nSeeing that confident demeanor, the Heavenly Demon stroked his beard with a satisfied look in his eyes.\nHis face was like that of a father looking at his now-grown son.\nAs the Heavenly Demon and as a believer of the cult, he had simply handled matters publicly according to doctrine.\nThat didn't mean he was devoid of emotion.\nIn his heart, he too hoped that his disciple Wi Jin-hak would become the next Cult Leader.\n'If Jin-hak takes over the next generation, and then Il-mok becomes the Heavenly Demon after that...'\nWith a thirty-year age gap between Wi Jin-hak and Il-mok, it was entirely possible.\nIf the already mature Wi Jin-hak ascended to the Cult Leader position and became Il-mok's protector, and Wi Jin-hak also accepted Il-mok's wise counsel to lead the cult...\nAnd if later, after Wi Jin-hak's ascension, the mature Il-mok took over the next generation to lead the cult...\nThe Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, with its foundation built over three generations, would shine during Il-mok's era.\nIt would be an unprecedented period of great prosperity, even for the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult with its hundreds of years of history.\n'If I could watch that scene from heaven, I would have no regrets.'\nBefore he knew it, a pleased smile had formed on the Heavenly Demon's lips.\nAfter the Chief Elder, who had been one of the pillars of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, passed away so meaninglessly, the news of what had happened in the council quickly spread.\nEspecially since the Council of Elders were all veterans of the cult, they could exchange information through various connections.\nThanks to this, it gradually became known how the Chief Elder had tried to kill Il-mok, and how Il-mok had caught the tail through the Hall of the Demonic Way and tracked down the head, the Chief Elder himself.\nAnd this news also reached the Law Enforcement Hall, which managed the cult's laws and executed apostates. Follow current novels on N0v3l.Fiɾe.net\n\"Phew.\"\nIn a hall located deep within the Law Enforcement Hall, the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall, who had been handling business, let out a frustrated sigh and turned his head toward somewhere.\nToward the building where he used to have secret meetings with the Chief Elder who had died so meaninglessly yesterday, and the Divine Guardian who had died over a year ago.\n'...I never thought the Chief Elder would die so futilely.'\nNo matter how much of a surprise attack it was, the fact that it was disguised as a suicide meant he hadn't even been able to resist\nThe man who had disposed of the Divine Guardian so easily hadn't even been able to fight back. As expected, the Heavenly Demon was an absolute being whom one could not dare to defy.\nBut what the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall feared wasn't the Heavenly Demon's martial power. His goal was to become the leader after the current Heavenly Demon ascended, after all.\nWhat shocked him was the very fact that the Chief Elder's identity had been discovered.\n‘He obtained that Black Bean Demonic Tea, and he had connections with the Vice Hall Master of the Hall of the Demonic Way. I thought he was a meticulous man.’\nThanks to the Chief Elder's meticulousness, even though they had already killed two of the Heavenly Demon's disciples, they hadn't been discovered.\n'...Come to think of it, that's strange. Why did he choose to stay silent and commit suicide?'\nThe Divine Guardian, the Chief Elder, and the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall himself, they were just a temporary alliance.\nAn alliance to push aside all competitors, including Wi Jin-hak, the Heavenly Demon's first disciple and their biggest rival.\nIn other words, they were future competitors who would fight a three-way battle after eliminating everyone else.\nThat's why, when the Divine Guardian was in danger of having his identity exposed, the Chief Elder stepped in to kill him.\nThere was no loyalty between them to hide each other's identities to the end.\n'...Not to hide me, but to save his subordinates?'\nThe Chief Elder's followers, perhaps it was to protect them, the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall speculated.\nAnd that was the end of the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall's reminiscence about the Chief Elder.\nSince they were just using each other anyway, he had no special feelings.\n'Judging from the Black Bean Demonic Tea incident and the matter of leaking the Fourth Young Master’s information to the Orthodox Faction to kill him, he was one hell of a shady bastard.'\nThe Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall concluded it was actually better this way, and his thoughts moved elsewhere.\n'More importantly, if the rumors are true, the Supreme One seems to cherish the Eighth Young Master quite a bit.'\nHe had even called him a child who would brighten the cult's future, there was no room for doubt about it.\nOn top of that...\n'He seemed to have no intention of protecting the Eldest Young Master, so there's still a chance for me... Wait?'\nThe Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall's eyes suddenly lit up as he continued thinking about the next Cult Leader position.\n‘In that case, wouldn't it be better to just win the Eighth Young Master over to my side! Yes, the Chief Elder died with his mouth shut, so he won’t know I was part of the group!’\nCome to think of it, he had originally suggested this to the Chief Elder too.\nSince the Eighth Young Master seemed capable, they should try to win him over rather than kill him.\nIt was just that the creepy Chief Elder bastard had rejected his proposal.\n“Hehehehe. I’ll have to find out what the Eighth Young Master likes. So he can join our Law Enforcement Hall after graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\nAs he pictured a beautiful future, a sinister smile appeared on the lips of the Chief of the Hall of Law Enforcement.\nWhile the main headquarters was in an uproar over the Chief Elder's death.\nThe Hall of the Demonic Way, where news was somewhat restricted, maintained a rather peaceful atmosphere.\nOf course, everyone was aware that some incident involving the vice-chief and two instructors had occurred.\nBut thanks to Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi and the instructors keeping quiet, it was gradually forgotten.\nOnly one person in the hall knew the full situation—Il-mok.\nAnd after hearing through Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi that the Chief Elder had died, Il-mok went to find Instructor Eun Ryeo.\n\"I'd like to return to the Meditation Club, Instructor.\"\nIt hadn't even been a month since he had joined the Theatre Club, yet here was Il-mok, requesting to withdraw again. But Instructor Eun Ryeo couldn't stop him. She had heard the gist of the situation from the Hall Master.\nThat he had stirred up various clubs to play the role of bait, and had temporarily taken refuge in the Theatre Club to avoid suspicion.\nOf course, she understood it rationally, but she wasn't particularly pleased.\n‘To think he used Jeong Hyeon again.’\nThe place he had taken refuge happened to be the Theatre Club that Jeong Hyeon belonged to.\n“Haaah. Do as you wish.\"\nEun Ryeo answered with an expression full of disdain.\nOf course, Il-mok didn't care.\n'Definitely old maid syndrome.'\nHe just understood it as her being an old maid and moved on.\nAnd after returning to the Meditation Club, Il-mok...\n\"Huaaaam.\"\nYawned and went for a nap.\n'The rats were dragged to headquarters and the boss is dead too. Master gave a warning as well. There shouldn't be anyone targeting me now.'\nYu Geuk, Ma Do-yeong, and Jeong Gyu-seok were among the few who were executed along with the Chief Elder.\nWhile the Chief Elder's suicide had buried the identities of others, they were caught red-handed.\nPlus, it contained a warning that anyone targeting Il-mok or young believers wouldn't be tolerated.\nMaybe because the shadowy figure he'd always been worried about had disappeared, his nerves, which had been on edge for a while, calmed down, and he felt much more at peace.\nPerhaps it was also thanks to going berserk once while performing the moonlit sword dance last time.\nThe problem was that his realm had risen again for no good reason.\nEven though Il-mok was blatantly taking a nap, no one bothered him.\nThe three stooges were a given, and Ma Do-yeong, who always interrupted his rest, was gone.\nHowever, a teaching assistant was temporarily in charge of the club in place of Ma Do-yeong.\nAnd that assistant just looked at Il-mok with a sour expression, unable to bring himself to discipline him.\nIt wasn't because Il-mok was the Heavenly Demon's disciple, or because he was the genius who had solved this incident.\nIt was just...\n'Wouldn't telling someone stronger than me that they’re being lazy be like smearing shit on my own face?'\nThe problem was that Il-mok had become stronger than him, the teaching assistant.\nThe assistant had definitely defeated Il-mok in the sparring match held at the beginning of their term, but in just half a year, the tables had turned.\nEven though they were a teaching assistant and a student, in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult that revered the law of the strong, nagging someone stronger was a rather bizarre act, not to mention dangerous too.\n\"Snore. Zzz.\"\nAnd so, peace came to Il-mok.\nA peace that lasted for exactly one day.\nThe next afternoon, at the hall of the Meditation Club, where he had arrived with the intention of taking a long nap as usual, a familiar face was waiting for him.\n“Huhuhu. It’s been a while, Disciple Il-mok.\"\n\"...What brings Instructor Chu here?\"\nIt was the former Head Instructor Chu Il-hwan, who had attacked Il-mok due to the Black Thunder Demonic Palm's rampage.\n“Well, the rats that infested this place had been caught thanks to your wits. And thanks to that too, my name was cleared. So I just returned to the Hall of the Demonic Way, and starting tomorrow morning, I'll be in charge of martial arts education again.\"\n\"Ah...\"\nDespite Il-mok's lukewarm response, Chu Il-hwan continued.\n“My name was cleared, and on top of that, I had the opportunity to stay in the Pure Mind Hall to straighten my mindset, so all I can say is thank you.”\nDespite his grateful words, Il-mok had a sour expression.\n'Dammit. Why this guy of all people?'\nThe misunderstanding about Chu Il-hwan being gay had been cleared up long ago. But sleeping in front of someone suffering from homicidal urges was unsettling even for Il-mok.\nUnaware of Il-mok's inner thoughts, Chu Il-hwan looked around cautiously, then approached Il-mok.\nAs Il-mok took an involuntary step back with an uneasy expression, Chu Il-hwan, having closed the distance, cautiously spoke.\n\"I know I’m being shameless, but could I ask you for one favor?\"\nIl-mok was anxious about what kind of unsettling favor he would ask, but the words that came out of Chu Il-hwan’s mouth were unexpected.\n“By any chance, are you well acquainted with the granddaughter of the Hyeokryeon Family?”\n\"...Are you talking about Seol-ah?\"\n'Why is Seol-ah suddenly popping up here?'\nChu Il-hwan nodded.\n\"Then, after you graduate from the Hall of the Demonic Way, could you pass along a message to that girl? Tell her that I didn't attack you on purpose, so please, for the love of god, stop.”\n\"......\"\nChu Il-hwan was pleading with the most desperate look in the world.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 139",
    "content": "Chapter 139: A Terrifying Man (1)\nI looked at Chu Il-hwan, who wore a pitiful expression that didn't suit him at all.\n“…You seem to have been through a lot?”\nInstead of answering with words, Chu Il-hwan just let out a deep, weary sigh with a look of complete exhaustion.\n‘What the hell did you do to him, kid?’\nTo push that crazy instructor to this point, if you could call it impressive, it was definitely impressive.\n‘Wait... I'm not going to get harassed too, am I?’\nSince I just wanted to rest up in the medical hall, I hadn't bothered sending any communication to the Hyeokryeon Family either.\nFeeling an ominous premonition that I'd be getting hassled by the kid after graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way, I quickly came up with a little scheme.\n‘I’ll just say the Hyeokryeon Family blocked my attempts to contact them.’\nRight. It was the Hyeokryeon family who kept my arrival at headquarters secret in the first place, so they could handle the cleanup too.\nAs I thought about what would happen after graduation, I naturally found a contradiction. Follow current novᴇls on N0velFire.ɴet\n\"But wait, the only time you'd see Seon-ah again would be when she enters the Hall of the Demonic Way, right?\"\nThe instructors of the Hall of the Demonic Way pretty much stayed holed up in this place all the time unless something special came up.\nEven that bastard Yu Geuk's betrayal happened because his ambitions exploded from being stuck in that stuffy Hall life.\nBut Chu Il-hwan sighed at my question and replied.\n\"That's exactly why I'm asking. I'm worried about when that girl enters the Hall. Disciple Il-mok.\"\n\"...Is there a reason for you to fear her?\"\nThis was the same Chu Il-hwan who had been itching to harass even me, a disciple of the Heavenly Demon who was practically a god in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nBut he's scared of Seon-ah coming in as a student?\nChu Il-hwan gave an awkward smile that was so unlike him.\n\"If I get harassed by that girl, I'm afraid my heart demons will take over and I'll end up killing her.\"\n\".......\"\nAs if aware of me looking at him like he is crazy, he added an excuse.\n\"Ahem. This whole incident actually helped me break through a barrier. My stay at the Pure Mind Hall allowed me to deal with my heart demon and Qi Deviation. But even someone like me doesn't have the confidence to endure that girl's harassment to the end. Ahem. Anyway, that's how it is. So please stop that girl. I don't want to kill her.\"\nI wondered if this was some new kind of threat.\nIf you want to keep that girl alive, stop her from harassing me.\nBut what was even more ridiculous was—\n“Weren’t you the one who kept throwing killing intent at me left and right?\"\nThe fact that this man, the same guy who tried to kill me, a disciple of the Heavenly Demon, was now afraid of killing Seon-ah.\n\"My attacks on you were only because I fell into a trap.\"\n\"...I remember you doing that pretty often on other occasions, no?\"\nAll those creepy moments when I mistook him for gay and thought my chastity was in danger. If those were all life-threatening situations, there had to be at least a dozen incidents.\nWhen I pressed him on this, Chu Il-hwan answered boldly.\n\"Hahaha. What I did to you was just playing around. It was something I could easily handle. But with that girl, I feel like I'd genuinely develop murderous intent.\"\n\".......\"\nThe words \"you crazy bastard\" circled around in my mouth, but I didn't bother saying them out loud.\nI just thought I should probably grant Chu Il-hwan's request.\nNot for his sake, though.\n‘Poor Seon-ah. Tsk, tsk.’\nAfter all, you avoid shit because it's dirty, not because you're scared of it.\nSeparate from the fact that Chu Il-hwan was a madman, for some reason, he didn’t bother my meditation.\n‘Tch. This whole thing's got me so unsettled I can't sleep.’\nIt was just that I was too anxious to get any proper rest.\nHe claimed he'd broken through barriers and overcome most of the side effects during his stay at the Pure Mind Hall, but from my perspective as someone who’d nearly been killed by his rampage, I couldn't really trust that.\nStill, it was definitely more comfortable than when Ma Do-young was the instructor in charge.\nAt least he wasn't constantly picking fights with me.\n\"Yaaaawn.\"\nEven during martial arts training, when I was lazily swinging my sword around and yawning constantly, he didn't seem to care at all.\nThough I wasn't sure why the trio forming a protective barrier around me was trembling like leaves.\nAfter spending several days in this relatively peaceful routine, today all the trainees from both the Upper and Lower Classes were gathered in the training hall bright and early.\nChu Il-hwan stepped forward with an unusually stern expression and briefly explained the situation.\n“You are all aware that an exam was scheduled for today. There was originally a different exam prepared, but due to a sudden change, today’s exam will be replaced with a sparring tournament.”\nI could pretty much guess what was going on.\nWith all that chaos, they probably couldn't even prepare for the exam.\nFrom the instructors' perspective, they would've been too busy with damage control to even think about test preparation.\nAnd as soon as Chu Il-hwan finished his explanation, Dokgo Pae shot his hand up.\n\"Do we choose our own opponents for the matches? And do we only get one chance to fight?\"\nThe one asking the question was already looking at me.\nTch.\nBecause of our agreement not to fight except during exams or when instructors ordered it, he was clearly itching to release all that pent-up frustration.\nHis excited face was creepy in so many ways, so I quickly turned my head away.\n\"Hm?\"\nThat's when I finally noticed there was an unfamiliar face among the instructors.\nA beautiful woman who looked slightly younger than Instructor Eun Ryeo, probably in her early thirties.\nThe woman who had taken over the doctrinal education instructor position in place of Instructor Jeong Gyu-seok was Xiao Hong.\nAs she scanned the disciples gathered in the training grounds, her eyes lit up when she spotted one in particular.\n‘That disciple must be the Eighth Young Master I've only heard about.’\nIt wasn't just because of the rumors floating around that she was interested in Il-mok.\nShe recalled what had happened two days ago.\nWhen the person she trusted and followed most after the Heavenly Demon, the master of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, had summoned her.\n\"I greet the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall.\"\n\"Come in, Deputy Commander Xiao.\"\nThe Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall, who usually wore a stern face befitting one who enforced the laws of the Cult, had greeted her with a particularly bright face that day.\n\"I have a mission to personally assign to you, which is why I called you here.\"\n\"If it's a mission from the Chief, I will carry it out with my life, whatever it may be.\"\nThe Chief smiled upon hearing her response.\n\"Hehehe, hearing you say that puts my mind at ease. Well then, you should prepare yourself starting today and head to the Hall of the Demonic Way tomorrow.\"\nAt those words, Xiao Hong almost flinched without realizing it.\n\"...By the Hall of the Demonic Way, do you mean I should become an instructor there?\"\n“Hohoho. You guessed it right. You are so quick-witted, I think I can rest easy.”\nUnlike the satisfied Chief, Xiao Hong felt like her insides were churning.\nIt wasn't particularly difficult to guess.\nThe news that there was an opening for an instructor position at the Hall of the Demonic Way had already spread throughout the cult like wildfire.\nThe problem was the very fact that she was being sent to become a Hall instructor.\n‘So this is how I'm being cast aside...’\nThe decades she'd spent serving in the Law Enforcement Hall and showing loyalty to the Chief felt meaningless.\nAs if sensing her misunderstanding, the Chief finally got to the most important point. “There is something you must accomplish when you go to the Hall of the Demonic Way as an instructor.”\n“…What might that be?”\nXiao Hong asked while secretly sighing in relief.\nThere was a separate mission to carry out. That meant he wasn't sending her to the Hall to get rid of her.\nBut instead of discussing the mission, the Chief brought up something completely out of left field.\n\"Have you heard the rumors about the Eighth Young Master?\"\n\"How could anyone in the cult not have heard rumors about the Eighth Young Master?\"\n\"Hehehe. Then what do you think of the Eighth Young Master?\"\nAfter thinking briefly about the Chief's question, she answered.\n“I thought the rumors might be exaggerated. If the rumors are true, I believe he would be a genius that could be counted on one hand even in the entire history of the Divine Cult.”\n\"From what I've been able to confirm through the information available to me, most of those rumors were true.\"\n\".......\"\nWhile Xiao Hong was momentarily speechless with surprise, the Chief dropped another bombshell.\n\"So think about this. What do you think would happen if that Eighth Young Master came to our Law Enforcement Hall after graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way?\"\n\"He would bring various changes to the Law Enforcement Hall and create countless achievements that would please the Heavenly Demon.\"\nThe Chief nodded and added.\n\"I don't know if you've heard of this in the rumors, but the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons described the Eighth Young Master like this: 'A child who will brighten the cult's future.' Even though there were seven disciples before the Eighth Young Master, the Supreme One had never used such an expression before. Do you understand what this means?\"\n\"...I believe it means that if the Eighth Young Master joins the Law Enforcement Hall, the Supreme One's attention and affection will likely turn toward the Law Enforcement Hall.\"\n\"Exactly. Hahaha. Right now, only I and the Eldest Young Master have noticed this fact, but others will probably catch on before long. That's why I'm sending you to the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\nOnly then did Xiao Hong fully understand what her mission was.\n‘As expected of the Chief. If we approach the Eighth Young Master after he graduates from the Hall, there'll be too many competitors and variables. To prevent this, he wants to win him over while he's still in the Hall.’\nAnd the person entrusted with that recruitment was her. As she was realizing the importance of her mission, the Chief spoke as if to reassure her.\n\"You don't need to worry about being transferred to the Hall of the Demonic Way. If you succeed in bringing the Eighth Young Master to the Law Enforcement Hall, I'll also have a better chance of moving up to a higher position. If I move up, I'll definitely take care of you.\"\n\"!!!\"\nXiao Hong's eyes instantly lit up. She had grasped the Chief’s true intentions.\n‘A position higher than the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall! The Chief must be aiming for the next Cult Leader position!’\nIf she could recruit the Eighth Young Master and help the Chief become the next Cult Leader, she would receive tremendous rewards.\n\"I will definitely complete this mission even if it costs me my life!\"\nAs she kneeled, the chief said with a satisfied expression.\n“Huhuhu. I’m counting on you. This is a task that only you can do.”\nWhile Xiao Hong was moved by the Chief's boundless trust, he said something completely out of the blue.\n\"The reason I'm sending you so urgently is because of this. Making the arrangements for you to be selected as an instructor was one problem, but more importantly, it took time to obtain some very crucial information.\"\n\"Very crucial information?\"\n\"That's right.\"\nThe Chief nodded and shared the top-secret information he had barely managed to obtain by mobilizing every connection he had.\n\"According to the evaluations of the instructors and Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi, the Eighth Young Master's talent is unparalleled, but he has one weakness. And you're the only one who can exploit that weakness.\"\n\"...What is this weakness?\"\n“They said he is fond of women.”\n\".......\"\nAt this unexpected weakness, Xiao Hong was left speechless.\nRecalling that day's events, she looked at Il-mok for a moment.\nWhether by coincidence or because he sensed her gaze, Il-mok turned his head to look at her.\nNaturally, the Chief's final words of advice came to mind.\n—He may be fond of women, but he's still just a sixteen-year-old kid. Use the charms of a seductive woman to captivate the Eighth Young Master.\nShe, who had been prostrating on the floor, had almost responded to the Chief’s advice without thinking.\n'The charms of a seductive woman. What is that?'\nAt thirty-two years old, she had spent her entire life focused only on martial arts and work.\nDespite having the looks to be considered a beauty, and there had been men who had approached her from time to time, she had always coldly rejected them every single time.\nIn other words, she had reached thirty-two without any romantic experience whatsoever.\nBut she couldn't reveal this fact to the Chief.\n‘This is a chance to achieve great merit! How can I throw away this opportunity!’\nSo after leaving the Law Enforcement Hall, she had sought advice from married acquaintances.\nAnd now, at this very moment when she made eye contact with Il-mok for the first time.\n‘They said first impressions are important, right? And that men are weak to a woman’s smiling face?’\nRecalling the advice she'd heard the previous night, Xiao Hong smiled awkwardly.\n\"!?\"\nIl-mok's face naturally scrunched up when he met her creepy smile.\n‘Goddammit. There was still an assassin left.’",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 140",
    "content": "Chapter 140: A Terrifying Man (2)\n\"!?\"\nWhen Il-mok's face crumpled at her smile, Xiao Hong was visibly flustered.\n'But... but I was told that men are weak to smiles?'\nJust when she didn't know what to do with this unexpected situation, a voice came to her rescue.\n\"That was a good question, Disciple Dokgo. The instructors have already arranged the sparring matches, and each of you will fight three rounds.\"\nSince Chu Il-hwan continued explaining the test, Il-mok's gaze naturally shifted to him.\nAfter Chu Il-hwan finished his brief introduction to the exam, he pointed to Xiao Hong with his hand.\n\"Starting after this exam ends, Instructor Xiao Hong will be taking over doctrinal education in place of Instructor Jeong Gyu-seok, who had to leave his position. Since she's from the Law Enforcement Hall, not only is her skill unquestionable, but she's also thoroughly versed in doctrine and law, so I expect you to trust and follow her guidance.”\nWith those words, Chu Il-hwan took a step back, allowing Xiao Hong to step forward.\nShe swept her gaze over the students and gave a brief greeting with her original cold expression.\n“I am Xiao Hong, and as of today, I will be serving as an instructor at the Hall of the Demonic Way.”\nThe Law Enforcement Hall was an organization that enforced the law, mainly handling the execution of apostates and criminals.\nHaving done such work for over ten years, Xiao Hong was accustomed to being blunt and cynical in official matters.\nHowever, when she looked over the students and made eye contact with Il-mok again, she almost flinched without realizing it.\n'...Did he figure it out?'\nAs if the crumpled face she'd seen earlier was just her imagination, Il-mok was looking at her with a bright smile.\nBut Il-mok's reason for smiling was a bit different from what she expected.\n'No need to show that I'm suspicious.'\nThere was no need to provoke an assassin, so Il-mok decided to act like he didn't know for now.\nFor Il-mok, who had worked as a civil servant for years dealing with difficult complainants, putting on a fake smile wasn't difficult at all.\nAfter Xiao Hong's introduction ended, the full-scale exam and sparring tournament began.\nFour instructors including Chu Il-hwan, four teaching assistants, and even Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi were observing the matches.\nSince this sparring was directly related to grades, everyone was fired up and ready to go.\n\"Trainees Jeong Hyeon and Choi Ung, step forward.\"\nAfter several matches had taken place, Il-mok began to show some interest.\n'Hmm. I wonder if she’s gotten over it a bit now?'\nJeong Hyeon was extremely reluctant to display her martial arts in front of people.\nTo help her overcome this, he and Baek Cheon had been cheering her on, which somehow led to the founding of the Theatre Club.\nHe was curious to see how much her time in the club had helped her.\n\"Go for it, Jeong Hyeon!\"\n\"Ohohoho! Show us the skills you've honed in the club!\"\n\"We believe in you!\"\nOn top of that, the three women from her club began cheering for her.\nIt had started under Il-mok's leadership. Praise makes even Jeong Hyeon dance.\n(TL Note: Kek, the original saying is “Praises even make whales dance”)\nSomehow reminded of that time, Il-mok also shouted to cheer her on.\n\"Show us your excellent archery, Jeong Hyeon!\"\nAt Il-mok's shout, Choi Woong, Jeong Hyeon's sparring opponent, scowled.\n'Damn it. Other people are getting cheered by others from the same club, but why don't I have anyone?'\nWhat’s more, Il-mok wasn’t just someone in the same club; he was the bastard who had forcibly dragged him into the Meditation Club. And instead of cheering for him, that bastard was cheering for his opponent.\n\"Hang in there!!\"\n\"We believe in you, buddy! Haha!\"\nMeanwhile, his two best friends, Seong Hwan and Mun Gyu, encouraged him.\n'Why do I only have guys cheering for me!'\nHe was just plain envious of Jeong Hyeon, who was receiving the cheers of the ladies.\nOf course, Jeong Hyeon, the object of Choi Woong’s envy, didn't know where to put herself.\n'I-I think I’m going to die of embarrassment.'\nJust being on the sparring stage was enough to drive her crazy, so why did they keep cheering like that?\nFeeling like her inner demon was about to surface, Jeong Hyeon quickly closed her eyes, took repeated deep breaths, and gathered her thoughts. She hadn't spent her time idly, either. She was slowly getting the hang of controlling the hypersensitivity of the Ghostly Spirit Divine Bow.\n“Ssssp. Huuu.”\nAs she pushed her concentration to its limit, the shouts from all around faded as if they were coming from far away. Instead, her senses toward Choi Woong in front of her were maximized to the point where she could feel every single one of his hairs fluttering in the wind.\n\"Begin!\"\nWith Instructor Chu Il-hwan's faint shout, Choi Woong deployed his lightness skill and charged forward.\nSwoosh!\nBut faster than him was an arrow that flew from Jeong Hyeon’s hand to his face.\nWhile Choi Woong deflected that arrow, another arrow she had already shot was flying toward him in succession.\n\"Ugh.\"\nAnd in that short span of time, she had angled and shot an arrow at a high trajectory, aiming for Choi Woong.\nhoi Woong somehow managed to deal with it all while trying to close the distance but Jeong Hyeon kept using her footwork while shooting, never giving him an opening.\nWatching the scene, Il-mok nodded with a satisfied expression.\n'To think she can now show her true skills in front of nearly thirty people, including instructors and teaching assistants!'\nFor Il-mok, who knew her original self, this was truly a moving moment.\nThat's why Il-mok shouted even louder.\n\"As expected, when it comes to archery, Jeong Hyeon is the best in the Hall of the Demonic Way!\"\nIl-mok was certain. Indeed, praise makes even Jeong Hyeon dance.\nRight after Jeong Hyeon and Choi Woong's match ended, the tournament's atmosphere became even hotter.\nIt was because of the cheering from the Theatre Club's ladies and Il-mok.\nNaturally, the students began enthusiastically cheering whenever someone from their own club was sparring as if it were an inter-club competition.\nWhen students from the doctrinal study club, which boasted the most members, were sparring, various cheers burst out.\nWhen Gwak Sul was sparring, Dokgo Pae roared like Zhang Fei at Changban Bridge, shouting with the force of dozens of men by himself.\n\"Gwak Sul!! Endure with your core strength! Show them the results of all the external arts training you’ve done!!!!”\nIn the midst of the successive matches, the one that caught Il-mok’s interest again was, surprisingly, Ju Seo-yeon’s match.\n'...Her skills have improved quite a bit in half a year.'\nIn this exam, where each student was scheduled for three matches total, her first opponent was a student Il-mok had never even had a conversation with.\nFrom the general atmosphere, he seemed to be from the Lower Class, but still appeared to be a top-tier fighter within the class.\nClang!\nClang! Clang!\nBut Ju Seo-yeon was relentlessly pushing that top-tier student.\nHer short spear moved swiftly, creating countless afterimages in the air, and her opponent seemed to be struggling just to endure her offensive, let alone counterattack.\nRecalling Ju Seo-yeon’s skills from the beginning of their term, this was truly a giant leap forward.\nAnd the match ended with her spear, which had been endlessly pressuring her opponent, finally striking his side.\n'...She might move up to the Upper Class soon.'\nAs if reading Il-mok's thoughts, Ju Seo-yeon, who had won her match, suddenly looked at Il-mok.\n\"Young Master! I won! Please wait just a little longer!!\"\nAt her sparkling eyes, cold sweat ran down Il-mok's back.\nWhen she first entered the hall, he had promised that if Ju Seo-yeon took second place, he'd take her as his attendant.\nOf course, he had made that condition thinking it would be impossible for her since she was dead last at the time.\n'...Did I run my mouth wrong?'\nA creeping sense of dread crawled up his skin as the possibility of having a sasaeng fan as his attendant popped into his mind.\nMeanwhile.\nXiao Hong, who was watching the students' enthusiastic cheering and sparring, felt a strange sense of unfamiliarity.\n'Was the atmosphere at the Hall of the Demonic Way always like this?'\nAlthough she hadn’t enrolled during the period when half the students were dropping dead, she vividly remembered that the competition in the Hall had been fierce.\nSince everyone was each other's competitor, she had rarely seen such a mutually supportive atmosphere.\nThere had even been cases where best friends from before entering the Hall had become enemies after repeated competition.\nAs if reading her mind, a voice spoke up.\n“Hahahaha! Isn’t it a good sight to see, Instructor Xiao?”\nCheok Il-so, who had approached her at some point, spoke with a hearty laugh.\n\"...The atmosphere seems very different from when I was a student at the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\nCheok Il-so nodded at her words and looked at the sparring stage.\nThere, Il-mok and Dokgo Pae were just stepping onto the stage.\n\"It's all thanks to Disciple Il-mok. The reason the students are cheering for each other now is because they are cheering for their fellow club members.”\n\"Ah....\"\nOnly then could she roughly understand the situation. The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the N()velFire.net\n'Come to think of it, the clubs were also something the Eighth Young Master initiated.'\nRumors about Il-mok were already widespread throughout the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, and investigating targets before missions was basic protocol.\n\"I didn't know since I was at headquarters, but the clubs seem to have had better effects than expected.\"\nAs someone who had to seduce Il-mok, she praised his achievements, and Cheok Il-so laughed heartily in response.\n\"Haha! That's what I'm talking about! That Dokgo Pae there was also able to improve his skills by refining his external martial arts with me in the Bodybuilding Club!\"\nAt Cheok Il-so’s words, filled with pride for Dokgo Pae, Xiao Hong just gave a light nod and looked at the sparring stage.\n\"Begin.\"\nThere, with Chu Il-hwan's instruction, Il-mok and Dokgo Pae's match began.\nClang!\nAnd in just one exchange, the match was over.\n\".......\"\nCheok Il-so, who had been praising Dokgo Pae enthusiastically, fell silent for a moment.\n\"Ahem. Disciple Il-mok is in a league of his own, so please understand.\"\nWhether Cheok Il-so was embarrassed or not, Xiao Hong didn’t care.\nShe was once again in a state where her composure was shaken.\nAs someone selected to be an instructor at the Hall, her skills were also at a level that could be called an expert.\nAs someone who had risen to the position of Deputy Commander of the Law Enforcement Hall, it is to be expected that her skills were up to par.\nSkills sufficient to be dispatched as an instructor, plus the looks to seduce a sixteen-year-old boy who was fond of women.\nAmong the people of the Law Enforcement Hall, Xiao Hong was the only one who met both conditions, which is why she was chosen.\nNaturally, her eyes could accurately read how Il-mok's sword moved.\n'...Is that really the skill level of a mere student?'\nShe was speechless at its sublimity.\nHe was certainly two or three levels below her.\nHowever, that also meant he was at a level where he could exchange a few blows with a Deputy Commander of the Law Enforcement Hall.\n'He has skills that would be more than sufficient even if we brought him to the Law Enforcement Hall right now.'\nWhat’s more, this is only his seventh month at the Hall of the Demonic Way, far from his graduation day. Which means he still has plenty of room and time to improve.\n'The Eighth Young Master started learning Demonic Art from age fifteen, right?'\nOnly then did the full scope of the situation dawn on Xiao Hong. Why does the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons treasure him so? Why the Chief she served was trying to win him over.\n'A genius of that caliber might truly be worth seducing.'\nShe had already forgotten the fact that she had never once seduced a man in her entire life.\nMeanwhile, Il-mok, who had subdued Dokgo Pae in just one exchange, was sighing. It wasn't because he had noticed Xiao Hong's interest.\nHe was simply terrified.\n'Whew. Good thing I ended it in one strike.'\nIf he had swung his sword more, he felt like his compulsion would have kicked in again.\n'Just two more times. Get it together, Il-mok.'\nIl-mok was determined not to gain any enlightenment in this exam.",

    "content": "Chapter 141: A Terrifying Man (3)\nFortunately, the sparring tournament ended with great success and safety.\nNo student went berserk during their matches, and Il-mok did not suffer from a relapse of his perfectionist compulsion and break into a sword dance.\nThe day after the tests ended peacefully, another typical—yet somehow special—day began at the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nMost of the time passed like any other day.\nThere were just two new developments.\nFirst, following the instructors, the students finally began their one-on-one counseling sessions with Physician Seo Jae-pil.\nSecond, today marked Instructor Xiao Hong's first day of teaching.\n“A pleasure to meet you all. As someone who once graduated from this very hall, I understand your passion better than anyone.”\nShe walked confidently among the students as she continued her introduction.\n\"So rest easy. I've served the cult at the Law Enforcement Hall for over ten years, protecting our laws and doctrines on the front lines.\"\nBut despite her confident words, her mind was a tangled mess.\n‘…Judging from his reaction on the first day, he seems to have some goodwill toward me.’\nAs she was thinking this, her eyes happened to meet Il-mok’s.\nSmile.\nIl-mok gave her a gentle smile, as if to say he was completely harmless.\nXiao Hong, who was usually thorough when it came to work, almost flinched at that smile without realizing it.\nShe might be skilled at her job, but she was a complete amateur when it came to romance.\nThank god she had prepared all of her lecture material in advance. Despite her flustered state, her mouth started moving on autopilot.\n\"Prophet Park once said...\"\nEven as the introduction ended and class began, her head remained in turmoil.\n‘Phew. That smile just now… He definitely seems to be warming up to me. So, what’s my next move?’\nThe advice from her married friends came to mind.\n‘Men have a strong need for recognition. Many of them will lay down their lives for someone who recognizes their worth.’\nThat advice came from a woman who'd won her seniors' love through praise. And then there was more...\n‘They say all men are wolves, you know? If you brush hands or bodies with them here and there, their hearts will be moved.’\nThat one came from a senior at the Law Enforcement Hall who'd successfully seduced and married her crush.\nDeciding this was the way to go for now, Xiao Hong, who had been walking among the students while teaching, came to a stop.\nRight in front of Il-mok.\n\"Disciple Il-mok.\"\n\"Yes, Instructor.\"\n“Give me your opinion on why the Prophet Park spared the herb gatherer, even though he executed the other evil men.”\n‘Probably because the crazy bastard just felt like it,’ Il-mok thought, but he wasn't stupid enough to say that out loud.\n‘What the hell is wrong with this scripture? Half the content is about killing people or why we should kill people.’\nWhile inwardly cursing the Secret Record of the Heavenly Demon—their so-called book of doctrines and scriptures—Il-mok wore a natural-looking smile.\n“Because while the others all made excuses about having families waiting at home and begged for forgiveness while still unrepentant, the herb gatherer vowed to follow the Prophet Park and dedicate himself to the cause of the cult. He repented, whereas the others succumbed to their inner evil.”\nIt was something he had learned from Jin Hayeon while preparing for his entrance exam, and a pretty basic question, so the answer wasn't difficult.\nBut for some reason, despite answering such a fundamental question, Xiao Hong smiled.\nIt was an artificial and awkward smile.\n\"Truly excellent.\"\nAfter delivering that wooden-like, awkward praise, her hand was already moving toward Il-mok's.\nUnder the pretense of praise, she was trying to sneakily grab his hand.\nSwoosh!\nBut her hand only grabbed thin air.\nIl-mok had already pulled his hand back.\n\".......\"\nXiao Hong's pupils shook violently. She hadn't expected Il-mok to avoid her touch.\n‘Sh-should I use a grappling technique to grab him?’\nThe thought actually crossed her mind, but she managed to hold back. That would look like an attack rather than seduction.\nOf course, it was already too late.\n‘Why is she suddenly trying to grab my hand?’\nIl-mok, who was already suspicious of her, felt his wariness dig even deeper into his mind.\nWhile they were both lost in their own thoughts, a strange silence fell over the hall.\n\".......\"\nXiao Hong felt her brain overheating as she frantically tried to think what to do.\nShe had to recall another piece of advice from one of her married friends.\n‘In the end, love is just another form of affection. And like any bond between people, you need to increase the time you spend together.’\nThis advice came from a friend who had married a man she'd worked with as a colleague for a long time.\n‘Right. I was too hasty this time. I need to gradually increase the time we spend alone together.’\nSo, how could she increase their time together? Xiao Hong didn't have to think hard to find the answer.\n\" Ahem . Since Disciple Il-mok gave an excellent answer, I think you deserve a reward.”\n\"...What kind of reward?\"\n“I grant you a special opportunity to receive private guidance from me outside of the regular class hours. Come to my office after your club hours are over.”\nHer “secret” invitation made Il-mok almost burst into laughter.\n‘…This one's even more obvious than Ma Do-yeong.’\nHe'd already seen through Ma Do-yeong, so he couldn't fathom why they would send an assassin who was even more conspicuous than the former.\nBut regardless of how obvious she was being…\n\" Ahem . With all due respect, Instructor, I think any of the other cadets here could have answered such a basic question. I will accept a reward when I've done something that truly deserves one.”\nIl-mok politely declined her invitation.\nAccepting an invitation from someone so obviously suspicious would be suicide.\n“V-very well.”\nXiao Hong's composure wavered. She hadn't expected a mere student to reject her so bluntly.\nBut since she'd prepared thoroughly for the lesson, there was no major problem continuing the class.\nLost in her lecture, she failed to see the peculiar looks the students gave her.\nFor the next few days, both during and outside class hours, Xiao Hong continued her subtle attempts to seduce Il-mok based on the advice she'd received.\nThen, around lunchtime on the third day, Instructor Eun Ryeo came to find her.\n“Instructor Xiao. May I have a word with you?”\n\"Of course, Instructor Eun.\"\nAfter following the stone-faced Eun Ryeo to a quiet spot, Eun Ryeo asked directly.\n\"I've heard the rumors. You have feelings for Young Master Il-mok, don’t you?\"\n\"...What do you mean, Instructor Eun? This is the first I'm hearing of this.\"\nXiao Hong, who had plenty of experience in everything except romance, quickly composed her expression and answered.\nBut it didn't work on Eun Ryeo. Not because she saw through Xiao Hong's mask, but simply because...\n“Since you are also a graduate from the Hall, you should know how small this place is. It means there are eyes and ears everywhere.”\nThe problem was that rumors were already spreading like wildfire among the students.\nXiao Hong tried to deny it again, but Eun Ryeo cut her off.\n\"Love is a private matter, so it's not my place to interfere. I called you here simply to offer a piece of advice.”\n\"What kind of advice...?\"\nXiao Hong felt a flicker of hope.\nAll her attempts at flirting with Il-mok over the past few days had failed. The advice from her friends had been useless, so she desperately needed a new perspective.\nBut Eun Ryeo's response was far from what Xiao Hong had hoped for.\n\"Give up on Disciple Il-mok.\"\n\"...What do you mean?\"\nXiao Hong's expression almost crumpled. Giving up on Il-mok was no different from giving up on her mission.\nUnaware of Xiao Hong's true intentions, Eun Ryeo spoke while forcing herself to remain expressionless.\n“It's unbecoming of me as an instructor to say this, but Disciple Il-mok is a man of many sins. Even if things work out, the ending won't be a happy one. He's a man who takes no responsibility when it comes to women.”\nAfter all, Il-mok had already abandoned Jeong Hyeon, Ju Seo-yeon, and Bang Mi-hwa.\nEun Ryeo felt nothing but pity for Xiao Hong, who had developed feelings for such a man.\n“I hope you will think carefully about my advice.”\nWith those final words, Eun Ryeo turned and left.\nGetting too deeply involved in someone's personal life wasn't wise, and besides, she found it hard to maintain her composure while looking at this poor moth drawn to Il-mok’s flame.\n\".......\"\nWatching Eun Ryeo's retreating figure after saying her piece and leaving, Xiao Hong couldn't hide her bewilderment.\n\"Tsk.\"\nShe clicked her tongue lightly and returned to her office, only to be summoned again shortly after.\n\"You called for me, Head Instructor?\"\nShe greeted Chu Il-hwan, who had temporarily become her direct superior, with a formal bow.\n\" Ahem . Come in.\"\nAnd for some reason, Chu Il-hwan showed an awkward attitude instead of his usual playful self.\n\"Hmm. I heard the story.\"\n“…What story might that be?”\nFeeling a strange sense of déjà vu, she asked back.\n\"Strange rumors involving you and Young Master Il-mok.\"\n\".......\"\nWhen Chu Il-hwan said the exact same thing as Eun Ryeo, Xiao Hong was momentarily speechless.\nMistaking her silence for something else, Chu Il-hwan quickly added.\n\"Ahem. Romance is a private matter, so I don't really intend to interfere. But Instructor Xiao, you've just been assigned to the Hall, remember? At least for a while, shouldn't your priority be adapting to the instructors, students, and how the Hall operates?\"\nFor Xiao Hong, this was humiliating advice.\nShe, who had always dedicated herself completely to her work—so much so that she had even accepted this ridiculous mission—was being treated like a rookie who couldn't separate her personal and professional life.\nBut being the professional she was, she quickly composed herself.\n\"I apologize for causing trouble for the Head Instructor.\"\n\"Hmm. It wasn't really troublesome, so don't worry about it.\"\n\"Then, could you give me some advice as a new instructor? I still don't know much about how the Hall operates recently or about the other instructors.\"\n“Hahaha! As the Head Instructor, it’s my duty to teach you about these things.”\nThe moment Chu Il-hwan answered, Xiao Hong started asking questions.\nAfter asking about the Hall's recent educational policies and the characteristics of other instructors for a while, Xiao Hong subtly probed the main topic.\n\"Ah, come to think of it, I actually heard something similar from Instructor Eun Ryeo.\"\n\"From Instructor Eun Ryeo?\"\n\"Yes. Instructor Eun Ryeo advised me to give up my feelings for Disciple Il-mok.\"\nXiao Hong didn’t miss the strange twitch in Chu Il-hwan’s expression.\n“By any chance, is there something unusual going on between Instructor Eun Ryeo and Disciple Il-mok?”\n\"Hmm. I'm not really sure.\"\nWhen Chu Il-hwan tried to squirm away, Xiao Hong cast a bigger lure. The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the N0velFire.ɴet\n“She also mentioned that Disciple Il-mok is a man of many sins. She even said he had no sense of responsibility. From the way she talked, there must be something between Instructor Eun Ryeo and Student Il-mok, right?\"\nFaced with her persistent questioning, Chu Il-hwan, who had been lost in thought, let out a sigh and answered.\n\"Actually, Instructor Eun Ryeo also had deep ties with Disciple Il-mok.\"\n\"Deep ties. Of what kind?\"\n\" Ahem . Well, if she's talking about responsibility… you can probably guess what that implies, can't you?”\nXiao Hong, who had no romantic experience, thought for a moment before her eyes widened dramatically.\nSeeing her shocked reaction, Chu Il-hwan sighed deeply. ‘So it's true! The conversation I overheard that day wasn't a misunderstanding!’\nChu Il-hwan recalled the conversation between Eun Ryeo and Il-mok he'd eavesdropped on the day he'd gone berserk. Combined with what he'd just heard from Xiao Hong, there was no room for doubt.\nHis head began to spin. This was why Chu Il-hwan had looked so uncomfortable from the moment he first called Xiao Hong in.\nIt wasn't just because this concerned Il-mok, the man who had forgiven him for his rampage.\n‘How in the world am I supposed to handle this kind of thing?’\nBetween the side effects of his Demonic Art and dedicating himself only to work and training, Chu Il-hwan had no romantic experience despite being nearly forty.\nIf he had to think about it, only one method of handling this came to mind.\n— Seducing so many women already! I should kill that goddamn bastard right now!\nThat’s what his Demonic Art whispered to him.\n‘Shut up!’\nThankfully, his self-discipline had deepened after the last incident, so Chu Il-hwan barely managed to suppress his inner demon.\nMeanwhile, while Chu Il-hwan was fighting his inner demons...\nXiao Hong, having received this shocking news, was weeping tears of blood on the inside.\n‘Oh, Chief, why have you given me such a trial?!’\nNot just because Il-mok was some lecher beyond her imagination.\n‘Didn't you say he was just a sixteen-year-old boy! Didn't you say he wouldn't understand a mature woman's charms!! If even Instructor Eun Ryeo, who's four years older than me, fell for him, how am I supposed to seduce that kid!?’\nIt was because she had realized her mission was far, far more difficult than she had ever anticipated.",

    "content": "Chapter 142: Counseling Log (1)\nIn the infirmary of the Hall of the Demonic Way, Il-mok sat across from Physician Seo Jae-pil.\n\"You're saying Instructor Xiao Hong is suspicious?\"\n\"That's right.\"\nIl-mok nodded and began to recount the events that had happened so far.\nFrom their first meeting when she suddenly gave him that bizarre smile, to how she tried to grab his hand during the first lesson, to inviting him to her office.\nAnd it didn’t stop there. She was always trying to find excuses to get close, to whisper something in his ear, or to offer him snacks.\nOf course, Il-mok had shut her down every time.\nHe knew that letting her get close was inviting a surprise attack so he dodged her whenever she approached. As for the snacks, they could've been poisoned, so he threw them away.\nAfter Il-mok finished explaining the long list of other strange incidents he had experienced, Seo Jae-pil who had been recording every word with a fascinated expression nodded once and replied.\n“Hmm. Well nothing is certain yet so I believe it would be best to just observe her for now.”\n\"Not certain?\"\nWhen Il-mok gave him a look that said 'You heard all that and you're still not sure?', Seo Jae-pil just smiled.\n\"That's right. For now, let’s talk about your Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword instead. How has that been treating you lately?”\n\"...It feels like there's a blade pressed against my throat,” Il-mok said, his face twisting with disgust. “Every damn second, I feel the side effects clawing at me, trying to take over.”\nHe wasn't just talking about his obsessive-compulsive symptoms. He was already used to hygiene obsessions and organizing compulsions. In fact, he saw them as a necessary release valve, a way to vent the demonic energy before it built up to dangerous levels.\nBut this was different.\nMaybe because he’d gotten so much stronger so fast, the side effects were constantly fighting him for control just like when he had fought Chu Il-hwan.\n“I see. It would certainly be dangerous for you to continue your martial arts training for the time being.”\n“Great. Can you please tell that to the Hall Master and the other instructors? Make sure they know I’m not slacking off just for the fun of it.”\n\".......\"\nSeo Jae-pil gazed at Il-mok’s deadly serious face for a long moment, then broke into a grin.\n“I’ll be sure to pass along the message. Whether the Hall Master will actually listen is another story.”\n\"Tch.\"\nIl-mok clicked his tongue lightly. He had a feeling that stubborn old fossil wouldn’t accept it.\n‘There goes my perfectly legitimate excuse to be lazy.’\nSeo Jae-pil gave the disappointed Il-mok some tea good for calming the mind and body and some rubbing alcohol for disinfection.\n\"Thanks.\"\nIl-mok took both items and left the infirmary. The moment the door closed behind him, Seo Jae-pil’s face split into a wide grin as he eagerly reread his consultation notes.\n\"Hahaha. He's so perfect despite his young age that I sometimes wonder if he is even human. Who would've thought even the Young Master had areas where he was clueless?\"\nSeo Jae-pil knew exactly what was going on.\nHe knew Xiao Hong wasn't an assassin. Her clumsy attempts were obviously geared toward seduction.\nHer advances were painfully clear just from hearing Il-mok’s side of the story, but that wasn’t his only source of information.\nNow that his counseling sessions included the students, he was privy to a whole host of rumors.\nAnd according to those rumors, Xiao Hong was far from the only woman with her eyes on Il-mok. Yet, the boy himself seemed completely oblivious to this fact.\n\"Hmm. All the instructors think Young Master Il-mok is a womanizer, so this is quite a fascinating phenomenon indeed.\"\nHow on earth had this all come about? The mad scientist in him was practically buzzing with curiosity.\nAfter jotting down a new research topic in his log, Seo Jae-pil pulled out all the counseling records with Il-mok and began reading them from the beginning.\nAnd like a true physician of the Pure Mind Hall, he was able to logically deduce why Il-mok couldn't pick up on women's feelings.\n“Hmm. So it’s a combination of everything he’s been through and the side effects of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.”\nIl-mok had faced countless life-threatening situations.\nThe Heavenly Demon who was now his Master had held a blade to his neck under the guise of a test, and a rampaging Wi Jin-hak had tried to kill him. Assassins had crept into his room at night and even his supposed bodyguard, Jang Hwi, had turned on him.\nAfter entering the Hall of the Demonic Way, he'd nearly died from the old monsters in the Peach Blossom Ridge, and he'd been attacked by the berserk Chu Il-hwan and Jeong Gyu-seok.\nAnd all of these incidents had happened in just a year and a half.\nThese were events that would be more than enough to give anyone a severe case of trust issues. On top of that, the side effects of his Demonic Art demanded perfection, which meant he was practically hardwired to view every situation with suspicion.\n\"Indeed, it must be difficult for the Young Master to trust people.\"\nSeo Jae-pil nodded and muttered with conviction, but there was a slight misunderstanding here.\nIl-mok hadn’t trusted any of these people before he’d even started practicing the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\nIn his mind, they were all crazy, brainwashed cultists.\nSure, he’d grown fond of a few of them, but it wasn't the kind of bond you have with a close friend or family member. It was more like…\n‘He’s a lunatic, but I guess he means well.’\n‘She’s a cultist, but it’s just her upbringing. Poor kid.’\nIt was that kind of feeling.\nLikewise, Seo Jae-pil, whom Il-mok considered a lunatic whose medical skills were at least useful, was currently scribbling additions into his consultation notes, his eyes gleaming.\nHe had no intention of telling Il-mok what he'd realized. Not that Xiao Hong's purpose wasn't assassination.\nNot that his trust issues were a product of his trauma and his Demonic Art, and definitely not that the instructors all thought he was a player.\n'Hehehehe. Where else could I find such a perfect test subject?'\nHis brush danced across the page, his eyes glinting with a mad sort of glee.\nThe following afternoon, after dinner, the students scattered for their respective club activities, and the instructors in charge did the same.\nInstructor Eun Ryeo arrived at the clearing designated for the Theater Club to find a lone figure already waiting there.\n\"Disciple Jeong.\"\n\"Yes, Instructor.\"\nLooking at the poor girl, Eun Ryeo had to physically stop herself from sighing. It was a sigh of pity, but she knew Jeong Hyeon would take it negatively.\n\"I got word from Physician Seo Jae-pil, so go to the infirmary now. He said it's your turn for counseling.\"\nAt Instructor Eun Ryeo's words, Jeong Hyeon's complexion brightened.\nJeong Hyeon’s face lit up instantly. This meant she could escape the club’s oppressively cheerful members, even if just for a moment.\n“Th-then… I’ll… I’ll go now.”\n“Go on. Take care.”\nWatching Jeong Hyeon's back as she walked away with a much brighter attitude, Instructor Eun Ryeo's expression soured.\n‘Leaving a pitiful girl like that all alone. That shameless bastard.’\nSeeing Jeong Hyeon’s plight had rekindled her anger at Il-mok. And that anger, in turn, made her think of someone else.\n'Instructor Xiao doesn't have much of an eye for men either.'\nEun Ryeo still couldn’t believe how aggressively Xiao Hong had pursued Il-mok the second she’d become an instructor. She honestly didn’t get it.\nSure, Il-mok was a genius—everyone knew that. And as the Heavenly Demon’s disciple, his status was unimpeachable. He was even good-looking. There were plenty of reasons to be attracted to him.\nBut...\n‘What is so damn great about a womanizer like him?’\nShe just couldn’t wrap her head around it—all these women fighting over one man, and Il-mok acting like he couldn’t care less about the drama he was causing.\n'Still, seeing as there are no rumors today, it seems like she's seriously considering my advice. That's fortunate.'\nShe couldn’t bear to see another poor soul get caught in that mess.\nIf more pitiful people kept appearing, Instructor Eun Ryeo wasn’t sure how long she could keep her own side effects in check.\n\"Hehehe. Please come in. Your name was Jeong Hyeon, right?\"\nSeo Jae-pil greeted Jeong Hyeon, who hadn't taken a single step closer from the entrance, with a kind-looking smile.\n“I-is it… a-alright if I have the c-consultation from… here?”\nIt was a strange request, but Seo Jae-pil accepted it without hesitation.\n\"That's perfectly fine. Just in case, I put a chair next to the entrance. Please, have a seat.”\nHe already knew about Jeong Hyeon from hearing about her from Instructor Eun Ryeo several times.\n\"You're learning the Ghostly Spirit Divine Bow, and the side effect is overdeveloped senses, correct?\"\n“Yes… Because of it, I g-get startled if people are even a little too c-close, and I can’t stop… worrying about it… I get anxious.”\n\"Hmm.\"\nUnlike when dealing with Il-mok, Seo Jae-pil wore a somewhat serene expression and asked in a reassuring tone.\n“So, you find being around people difficult?”\n“Ah, um… it’s hard, b-but… it’s not… unwanted.”\nHer words might have sounded like total nonsense but he just smiled kindly.\n\"Could you explain in a bit more detail?\" Official source ıs N0veI.Fiɾe.net\n“Um… H-having people nearby is s-scary and… and nerve-wracking. B-but… I still want to… to m-make friends…”\nBy the time she said the last part about \"wanting to,\" Jeong Hyeon was blushing like she'd made a confession.\n'Ooh. Interesting. One side effect creates a cascade of other issues, just like how Young Master Il-mok developed distrust in people due to the side effects of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword and his experience.'\nWhile Jeong Hyeon had her head down, Seo Jae-pil's eyes sparkled with intellectual curiosity before he quickly composed himself and asked gently.\n\"So Disciple Jeong Hyeon would like to get along with people if possible.\"\nJeong Hyeon nodded timidly.\n“I-I don’t know if I can, though…”\n“Hahaha. But aren’t you already participating in the Theater Club?”\n“Th-that place is a little…”\n“I see. Is there someone in the club you don’t get along with?”\n“I-it’s not that I dislike them… it’s just a bit… much.”\n“Hmm. Whose behavior do you find the most overwhelming?”\nSeeing her hesitate, Seo Jae-pil quickly added, “Ah, if you feel bad about speaking ill of someone, you don’t have to tell me their name.”\nI-it’s not that… It’s just that… there’s no one who isn’t overwhelming.”\n\"...This might be a bit awkward to ask, but if you find everyone there so difficult, why do you stay?”\nJeong Hyeon’s head sank even lower. “B-because if I change clubs… I’ll s-stand out.”\n“So you’d rather suffer in silence than risk drawing attention to yourself?”\n\"Yes...\"\nSeo Jae-pil was starting to get why Eun Ryeo was so protective.\n‘She really does have a talent for making you feel sorry for her.’\nEven he felt a pang of sympathy, and he was a normal person. He could only imagine how it affected Eun Ryeo, who was struggling with her own issues.\n“Hmm. If it’s that difficult, I could quietly arrange for you to switch clubs.”\n“N-no, it’s okay!” Jeong Hyeon yelped in alarm.\n“Th-that would be a bother for Instructor Eun Ryeo... a-and the other clubs are full of strangers, so it would be just as u-uncomfortable… And… I-I’m slowly adjusting, so it’s fine. Really.”\n“You’re adjusting?”\nSeo Jae-pil almost replied in a tone that showed he found it completely unbelievable. He barely held back since that was absolutely not an attitude a physician of the Pure Mind Hall should show.\n“Yes… To overcome the side effects and… and get along with people… I have to.”\nHearing Jeong Hyeon's following answer, Seo Jae-pil smiled brightly.\n\"That's a good mindset.\"\nThey continued counseling for quite a while after that. After a while, as Jeong Hyeon grew slightly more comfortable, her stutter began to fade. That’s when Seo Jae-pil asked his final question.\n\"Then, is there anyone in the Hall of the Demonic Way that Disciple Jeong Hyeon would like to spend time with?\"\n\"Instructor Eun Ryeo. Sh-she’s always so kind to me. I feel the most comfortable with her.”\n\"Anyone else?\"\nJeong Hyeon seemed to think about it for a moment, then abruptly ducked her head again and mumbled, “I… I’d like to s-spend time with… Y-Young Master Il-mok, too.”\nSeo Jae-pil didn't miss it. Just before her head went down, her face had turned a deep shade of crimson.\nIn fact, he could tell just from her ears showing through her hair. They had turned bright red as if they might burst into flames.\nIt took every ounce of his willpower not to break into a massive grin.\nIt wasn't because Jeong Hyeon's innocent appearance was cute.\n‘I knew it! Humans are the best!’\nHis thirst for research was bubbling over like lava from a volcano.\nShortly after finishing his consultations with Jeong Hyeon and a few other students, Instructor Xiao Hong came to the infirmary.\n\"Please come in, Instructor Xiao Hong.\"\n\"Nice to meet you, Physician Seo Jae-pil.\"\nSince she had only recently been appointed as an instructor, he needed to start her consultations from the beginning.\n‘Let’s see, she’s infatuated with Young Master Il-mok. I wonder if that’s a symptom related to her Demonic Art.’\nRecalling what he knew about her, Physician Seo Jae-pil offered a gentle smile and cut right to the point.\n“By any chance is the side effect of your Demonic Art feeling sexual desire for young men?”\n\".......\"\nEssentially being asked if she was a pedophile, Xiao Hong’s face instantly crumpled.",

    "content": "Chapter 143: Counseling Log (2)\n“Are you seriously asking me that question?”\nPhysician Seo Jae-pil just smiled gently at her retort.\n“Hahaha. My apologies if I’ve offended you. In that case, would you be so kind as to tell me what your side effect is?”\nXiao Hong, who'd been scowling, let out a small sigh before answering.\n\"It’s bulimia.\"\n\"Oh my... that must be really tough for you.\"\nXiao Hong looked genuinely surprised at Seo Jae-pil's reaction. \"You really think so?\"\nEveryone who'd heard about Xiao Hong's side effects before had basically shrugged it off like it was nothing. Thɪs chapter is updatᴇd by novel⁂fire.net\nAfter all, a compulsion to eat seemed trivial compared to the side effects of other Demonic Arts. But this physician from the Pure Mind Hall was different; he seemed to be trying to understand her struggle.\n“Isn’t it true that anything in excess is worse than not having enough? Repeatedly overeating is just as harmful to the body, so bulimia is most certainly a damaging side effect.”\n\"That's not even the worst part. For a martial artist, binge eating disorder is absolutely devastating.\"\nMaybe because she'd finally found someone who actually got it, Xiao Hong started venting all the frustration she'd been bottling up.\n\"If I try to train after stuffing myself, I just end up puking my guts out. My body can't digest anything properly. And when you keep overeating, you obviously gain weight, and when you gain weight, it screws with your martial arts. The real problem is, when I gain weight and my skills get worse, I get angry at myself, and when I get angry, the binge eating gets even worse.\"\n“I see. It sounds like a truly vicious cycle.”\n\"And that's when I can actually get food. When there's not enough to eat around here? That's when I feel like I'm going insane. When other people feel a little peckish, I feel like I'm losing my goddamn mind.\"\nHer rant just kept rolling after that.\nHer ambition and her desire to excel in her work were just part of her natural disposition.\nThe problem was that the stress from all that drive allied with her binge eating disorder to make her life hell.\nWhenever work wasn't going well, her stomach would start acting up, demanding food.\nBut if she actually ate what she wanted, she'd gain weight and screw up her martial arts.\nAnd if she really lost it and gave in to the binge eating? She could literally eat herself to death from overeating. Her binge eating disorder was a side effect of her Demonic Art, so it didn't know the meaning of moderation.\nXiao Hong was basically fighting a war with her body over food every single day.\nAs she vented for a while...\n\"Phew.\"\nXiao Hong started chugging the tea that had already gone cold.\nWatching her, Seo Jae-pil calmly asked, “So, your feelings for Disciple Il-mok have nothing to do with the side effects of your Demonic Art?”\n\"Pfft!!\"\nThe sudden mention of Il-mok made Xiao Hong spit out her tea.\nEven with tea splashed all over his face, Seo Jae-pil let out a sigh of relief.\n‘Phew. At least the log is safe.’\nIn that split second, he had lunged to shield his notes from the spray.\n\"I'm so sorry!\"\n“It’s quite all right. Hahaha. It seems my question was a bit too abrupt.” Seo Jae-pil replied, casually wiping his face with a cloth.\nXiao Hong watched him and thought for a moment.\n‘The rumors are already everywhere, so denying it won't convince anyone. But I can't exactly tell him it's a mission from the Chief either.’\nAfter thinking it over, she had no choice but to lie.\n\"Yes. It has nothing to do with side effects, it's just my personal preference.\"\nSeo Jae-pil nodded and started writing in the records he'd barely managed to save, muttering to himself.\n\"Preference for young men is unrelated to Demonic Arts. Got it.\"\n\".......\"\nXiao Hong's face turned even redder than when she'd admitted to having a binge eating disorder.\nAfter that, Seo Jae-pil's counseling sessions continued.\n\"Nice to meet you, Diciple Ju Seo-yeon.\"\n\"Nice to meet you, Physician Seo!\"\nJu Seo-yeon entered the room with a bright smile, but the moment she finished her greeting, her head started whipping around, scanning the inside of the infirmary.\nSeeing her somewhat distracted behavior, Seo Jae-pil smiled. “I hear you wish to become Disciple Il-mok’s attendant?”\nOnly then did Ju Seo-yeon's wandering gaze return to Seo Jae-pil.\n\"That's right, Councilor. I absolutely have to become Young Master Il-mok's attendant.\"\nHer answer matched what Seo Jae-pil had been told.\nAccording to Instructor Eun Ryeo, Disciple Ju Seo-yeon also has feelings for the young master.\nRecalling the information he'd gotten from the instructors earlier, Seo Jae-pil asked, \"May I ask why?\"\nBut the answer he got was completely unexpected.\n“Because that’s the only way I can be with Lady Jin Hayeon, Physician Seo.”\n\"Jin Hayeon... ah, you mean Young Master Il-mok's current attendant? The one from the Hidden Guard Pavilion?\"\n\"Exactly! So you know about Lady Jin Hayeon too, Physician Seo!\"\nJu Seo-yeon’s eyes were now sparkling with an intensity that dwarfed her previous demeanor.\nShe went on and on praising Jin Hayeon, while Seo Jae-pil's eyes sparkled as he scribbled down the counseling content.\nIt wasn't that he'd been influenced by Ju Seo-yeon and gotten interested in Jin Hayeon himself.\n‘Is it admiration or infatuation? A fascinating gray area worth researching. In any case, Disciple Ju Seo-yeon’s feelings for Miss Jin might also be a side effect of her Demonic Art.’\nIt was simply his mad scientist instincts kicking in.\nTo satisfy his medical curiosity, he asked, “Hmm. Would you mind telling me about the Demonic Art you practice, and its side effects?”\nBut once again, the answer was not what Seo Jae-pil expected.\n\"It's called Mad Spirit Wind Demon Spear, and I was told the side effect is becoming easily distracted, but…”\nPerhaps because the topic had shifted away from Jin Hayeon, Ju Seo-yeon didn’t even finish her sentence before she started looking around the room again.\nSeo Jae-pil didn’t comment on her distractible behavior.\n‘Hmm. It seems the side effect isn’t simply distraction. It’s more likely that her focus becomes so completely absorbed by one thing that she appears scatterbrained about everything else.’\nHe watched her with his eyes gleaming with interest.\nAfter his first session with Ju Seo-yeon concluded, a female student entered the infirmary holding a fan to the lower half of her face.\n“Ohohoho.”\n\"Nice to meet you, Disciple Bang Mi-hwa.\"\n“Ohoho. The pleasure is all mine.”\nShe answered haughtily, snapping her fan shut with a sharp thwack .\n\"To be honest, I am only here because the regulations state that I must have a consultation. I personally do not believe I need one.”\n\"May I ask why?\"\n“I am perfect simply by virtue of being me, why would I need this kind of counseling? Oh! I'm not criticizing you, Physician Seo. I’m sure your services are necessary for all the poor souls who need to manage their hearts after falling for me. Ohohoho.”\n\".......\"\nEven though Seo Jae-pil hadn't asked about her Demonic Art and its side effects, he somehow had a pretty good idea what her Demonic Art and its side effects were\nBut counseling was counseling. And since an excellent research subject had come to him, Seo Jae-pil tried to keep the conversation going.\n\"So what do you do in your free time when you're not training?\"\n“Did you at least hear about the side effects before you started learning the art?”\nBut it was hard to call what followed a conversation.\n“Ohoho. I spend my time gazing into a mirror or practicing my acting. They say looking at beautiful things calms the soul, don’t they? And watching my beautiful self, or watching my beautiful self act, fills me with nothing but joy.”\n\"I did hear about the side effects. That I would fall in love with myself, was it? But that’s not a side effect, is it? How could anyone not love someone as beautiful as me? Hohoho. This must be why Young Master Il-mok has fallen for me as well.”\nIt was a veritable festival of delusion. If Il-mok had been there, he probably would have felt dizzy, claiming his own Demonic Art was about to go haywire. But Seo Jae-pil’s reaction was quite different.\n‘Hahaha! The Hall of the Demonic Way really is an interesting place!’\nHe was overflowing with research subjects.\nOf course, the main headquarters had plenty of crazy people too, but the atmosphere was different. The martial artists at headquarters were mostly older, so it was tricky to get them to open up about their inner thoughts.\nBut the apprentices at the Hall of the Demonic Way were still young, so most of them showed their raw emotions without filtering. And even when they tried to hide things, they weren't skilled at it, so he could easily dig deeper.\nBy the time all of his year-mates had finished their first consultations, Il-mok went to the infirmary again.\n\"I heard you also conducted counseling with Instructor Xiao Hong.\"\n\"That's correct.\"\n“It seems she’s realized she’s under suspicion. Did anything strange come up during the consultation?”\nIl-mok asked with an uncomfortable expression.\nFor some reason, Xiao Hong, who had been so brazen in her advances, had suddenly backed off.\nOf course, Seo Jae-pil didn't reveal what he'd learned.\n\"Nothing particularly suspicious so far.\"\nHe didn’t feel the slightest pang of guilt for lying.\n‘It was also the Eighth Young Master who decided that counseling content shouldn't be shared with others, so he should understand.’\nThe person who'd given him justification was right there in front of him, that young genius.\nIt's just that in the past, it had been temporarily allowed because there were people targeting the Eighth Young Master.\nAnd more importantly…\n‘If I told him the truth, I wouldn't be able to continue my research. Hehehe.’\nEvery movement, every psychological shift of the instructors and cadets in the Hall was a data point for his research.\nAnd since the Eighth Young Master was at the center of it all, he had a duty to observe how things would unfold without his interference.\n\"...Something feels off.\"\nIl-mok still seemed suspicious of Xiao Hong, so Seo Jae-pil opened his mouth to change the subject.\n\"Hehehe. Actually, after conducting counseling with students, instructors, and various people from headquarters, I've discovered one particular symptom, Young Master.\"\n\"What is it?\"\n“Not everyone has it, but it appears frequently. It’s… how to put it? Like they don’t listen to a word anyone says? No, it’s more that they only seem to hear what they want to hear.”\nBang Mi-hwa was the most severe case, and there were quite a few others showing similar symptoms, including Dokgo Pae and Ju Seo-yeon.\nFor reasons he couldn't fathom, those with the most severe cases also happened to be the ones closest to Il-mok. He brought it up casually.\n\"I'm thinking of researching this condition, but I'm having trouble coming up with a concise term to describe it.\"\n\"A symptom where they only hear what they want to hear? Hmm.\"\nIl-mok thought for a moment.\n‘I feel like I heard about this when I was Seo Ji-hoon?’\nSoon, Il-mok was able to recall the term.\n\"How about calling it confirmation bias?\"\n“Oho. A bias in how one confirms information.”\n\"Or conversely, you could see it as only accepting biased information to confirm what they already believe.\"\n\"Indeed, you truly are amazing, Young Master! Hehehe.\"\nSeo Jae-pil was praising him like it was brilliant, but Il-mok finally felt something was fishy.\nIt wasn't about Seo Jae-pil.\n‘Wait a minute, why is this place filled with nothing but confirmation bias patients?’\nIl-mok could easily find the answer to his own question.\n‘...I guess it's natural when you combine a cult with Demonic Arts.’\nPeople with firm beliefs tend to show confirmation bias. This is especially true if they believe in cult doctrines that have nothing to do with logic. It'd be weirder if they didn't have confirmation bias.\nAdd Demonic Arts that cause mental illness on top of that, and it's like putting a cherry on top.\nIt was a structure where even normal people would inevitably develop confirmation bias after spending a few years here.\n\"I really need to get out of here...\"\n\"You mean the Hall of the Demonic Way?\"\nIl-mok nearly flinched when Seo Jae-pil responded to his muttering.\nDesertion meant apostasy, which could get his head chopped off.\nSo Il-mok quickly made up an excuse.\n\"After graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way, I'm thinking of going to other regions for the sake of the Divine Cult.\"\n\"Other regions... Ah! Are you planning to visit the Central Plains where the unbelievers live?\"\n\"Exactly. We need to spread the word of our Divine Cult there too, don't we?\"\nIt was an excuse he’d cooked up on the spot to avoid being labeled a traitor, but the more he thought about it, the more it sounded like a damn good plan.\n‘I might be young, but I’m the Heavenly Demon’s disciple. If I go, I’ll probably start as a branch master. It’ll be far from the main headquarters, so they won't be able to keep a close eye on me. It would be the perfect place to hole up in a quiet branch and just chill.’\nHe even had the perfect pretext.\n‘I could say I'm going to the Central Plains to gather information and get revenge on the Flying Dragon Pavilion Master who killed Uncle Tae-hyeon.’\nRevenge was revenge, but first he'd enjoy as much peace as possible, then look for the right moment to get his revenge.\n‘Great. It's a perfect plan! Once I graduate from the Hall of the Demonic Way, I'll finally have peace!’\nWhile Il-mok was grinning as he imagined his happy future...\nSeo Jae-pil was also picturing his own future.\n‘The Young Master will graduate from the Hall of the Demonic Way in one year and five months, so I can follow him then. Hehehe.’\nAfter studying crazy people—no, people suffering from Demonic Arts—Seo Jae-pil thought he needed to compare them with people who hadn't learned Demonic Arts.",

    "content": "Chapter 144: Heartbreak (1)\nFor the first time in the seven or so months since he’d entered the Hall of the Demonic Way, Il-mok was finally enjoying a bit of peace.\nChu Il-hwan, who had once hounded him relentlessly, hadn't bothered him since returning to the Hall.\nThe same went for Xiao Hong. She had been remarkably quiet lately after her very conspicuous attempts to get close to him during her first few days.\n'Yeah, right. Something's fishy about this.'\nIl-mok still felt uneasy about Xiao Hong, but decided to let it slide for now. Thanks to her sudden change to being well-behaved—probably to avoid standing out—there was no one left to bother him anymore.\nHe slacked off during training sessions and took naps during meditation time while managing his side effects.\nBut while Il-mok was at peace, there was one person whose insides were twisting into knots, or rather, whose stomach was shriveling up.\n'What the hell am I supposed to do?!'\nXiao Hong felt like she was being backed into a corner with each passing day.\nAt first, she’d thought the mission would be easy.\nHadn't the Chief said so himself? That it was a simple job of seducing some sixteen-year-old brat.\nSure, she might not have any experience in seducing men, but she figured if she prepared thoroughly, it was a task well within her abilities.\nBut the Eighth Young Master wasn't an easy target.\nLiving up to his reputation as a womanizer, he'd already dealt with quite a few women and wouldn't easily fall for her seductions.\nTo make matters worse, her attempts to seduce Il-mok had drawn too much attention from everyone at the Hall of the Demonic Way, which was now coming back to bite her.\nShe decided that it was a strategic time to retreat, trying to lessen the attention drawn to her.\n'But I can't think of any way to advance!'\nAt this rate, her retreat would be permanent. The mission would just end.\nThe dreadful feeling that she was about to fail was making her side effects flare up.\n—This is hard, isn’t it?\n—Looks like it's a lost cause anyway, so why don't you eat something?\n—They say even a ghost looks better if it died with a full stomach. Go on. Eat.\nAs the temptation of her binge-eating disorder grew stronger each day, she'd recently started fasting completely.\nShe knew that the moment food touched her lips, she would lose all control of herself.\nThen one day, while she was locked in this grueling battle with her side effects, Head Instructor Chu Il-hwan summoned her.\n“You wished to see me, Head Instructor?\"\n\"Ah, have a seat first.\"\nChu Il-hwan looked at Xiao Hong with a somewhat complicated expression as she sat down.\n“Instructor Xiao’s life seems to be harder than I expected.”\n\"Not at all, Head Instructor. I'm adapting to it well enough now.\"\n“It’s just… you’ve gotten noticeably gaunt these past few days.\"\nChu Il-hwan spoke in a hesitant tone.\nHe couldn’t help but feel a pang of pity watching her wither away day by day.\n'I've heard of lovesickness before, but damn, it's really a terrible disease.'\nThough he'd casually attributed it to instructor duties, Chu Il-hwan suspected she was in this state because of Il-mok.\nHis guess was half right.\nShe was indeed like this because she'd failed to seduce Il-mok.\nBut Xiao Hong had no desire to reveal the truth and offered a vague excuse.\n\"You don't need to worry about me, Head Instructor. I’ve just been pushing myself a bit too hard trying to manage the side effects of my Demonic Art.”\nChu Il-hwan gave her advice based on his own experience.\n“If it’s because of your Demonic Art… trying to forcefully suppress the side effects might not be the best way. It’s not a bad idea to let it out a little at a time. Just find a way to do it somewhere with no people, so you don’t harm the students.”\nChu Il-hwan himself would secretly slip out of the Hall of the Demonic Way when his murderous impulses became too intense. Go wild in the mountains for a bit, then return. His usual method was to hunt the wild animals living in the mountains.\nAs he shared his method, Xiao Hong answered with an anxious face. ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ novelꞁire.net\n\"...But what if trying to release them just a little leads to completely losing control?\"\n\"That's exactly why I told you to think of ways that won't harm the students. I used to go to the mountains for this reason. If there are no people around, no one will get caught up in the side effects, right?\"\n“…I will consider it.”\nAfter finishing her conversation with Chu Il-hwan, Xiao Hong left the office with a gaunt face.\nThen she went to the dining hall and asked the workers there to prepare about five portions of food for a late-night meal.\n'If we're going by three meals a day, I've already starved for three days, so I should eat at least nine portions! I've reduced it to five portions, so this should be enough to not give in to the side effects!'\nShe had officially entered the realm of self-deception.\nLate that night, somewhere in the Hall of the Demonic Way.\n“Hwaaaahm.”\nWaking from a deep sleep, Il-mok stretched and opened his eyes.\n\"Ugh, so stiff.\"\nMuttering to himself, Il-mok looked around and belatedly realized where he was.\nHe was in the Meditation Club's hall. He’d dozed off while sitting cross-legged and had fallen into a much deeper sleep than intended.\n\"Damn jerks. Would it kill them to wake me up before leaving?\"\nIf the trio had heard his muttering, they would have shed tears of injustice.\nThis was the same guy who would grab his sword sheath if anyone so much as breathed too loudly during his nap, and now he was angry they hadn't woken him?\nEven Chu Il-hwan, who owed his life to Il-mok’s mercy, didn't want to disturb his rest.\nIn the end, both Chu Il-hwan and the trio had quietly left to avoid disturbing Il-mok's nap, which led to him sleeping until this hour.\n\"Did I sleep too long? I'm getting hungry...\"\nHis steps toward the Black Dragon Pavilion turned toward the dining hall instead.\n'I wonder if there are any leftovers.'\nThe kitchen staff would have already gone back to their dorms by now. He just planned to grab any leftover side dishes for a quick bite before sleeping.\n“Hwaaaahm.”\nIl-mok yawned as he reached the entrance and stepped inside.\n\"......\"\nThe sight that greeted him made him freeze on the spot.\nLate at night, the dining hall was naturally empty.\nExcept for one spot.\nChomp chomp.\nAnd at that spot sat a woman, shoving food into her mouth.\nShe seemed to find chopsticks and spoons too cumbersome, so she grabbed handfuls of food with both hands and crammed them into her mouth. Her appetite was so immense that a mountain of food was piled on the table in front of her.\nChomp chomp.\nAnd that mountain of food was vanishing into her mouth at an incredible speed. It was a scene straight out of a horror story about a hungry ghost.\n\"......\"\nAs Il-mok stood there with a dumbfounded look on his face, Xiao Hong—who had completely lost herself in her first feast in three days—accidentally knocked a dumpling off the mountain of food.\nShe lunged down to grab the fallen dumpling and stuffed it straight into her mouth.\nAs she straightened up with her cheek puffed from the dumpling, she finally noticed someone standing at the entrance.\n\"......\"\n\"......\"\nSilence fell between Il-mok and Xiao Hong as their eyes met.\n\"S-sorry, Instructor Xiao. P-please, enjoy your meal.”\nIl-mok managed to get the words out in a strained voice before immediately turning and fleeing the dining hall.\nOnce outside, Il-mok looked back toward it with various emotions on his face.\n\"Holy shit...\"\nAn exclamation of pure awe escaped his lips. He had never witnessed such a spectacle.\nFood debris was everywhere. Discarded utensils lay scattered on the table. Both of her hands were caked in food.\nIt wasn’t just her hands; her face was splattered with sauces and scraps, and her clothes were a complete mess. And on top of all that, she had literally thrown herself on the ground to rescue a piece of fallen food.\nHe had never in his life seen a woman, especially one who was actually quite beautiful, eat with such ravenous ferocity.\n“If only they had YouTube here, she would’ve been a superstar.”\nMaybe she could have pioneered mukbang in this world.\n“Hmm. Or maybe not. Seeing that just killed my appetite instead of whetting it. Probably no hope for her.”\nThe sight of her shoveling food into her mouth so crudely had completely erased the hunger he’d felt just moments before.\nA short while after Il-mok returned to the Black Dragon Pavilion, Xiao Hong was still in the dining hall, shoveling food into her mouth and crying.\n'It's all over...'\nChomp chomp.\nNo matter how lacking she was in romance, she knew this much from common sense.\nNo man would love an ugly woman whose eyes had rolled back from gluttony.\nChomp chomp.\nSure, there was the saying about eating heartily being charming, but this was different.\nFrom her mouth to her hands and clothes, everything was covered in food scraps.\nChomp chomp.\nAnd most importantly, no one would call a woman who eats food off the floor “charming.”\nWas it because she thought her mission had completely failed?\nChomp chomp.\nHer mood plummeted once more, and she mechanically crammed the rest of the food on the table into her mouth.\n'If I fail this mission, the Chief won't call me back to the Law Enforcement Hall.'\nChomp chomp.\n'I'll be stuck rotting in the Hall of the Demonic Way for life.'\nWith a look of utter resignation, she let her Demonic Art take over and continued to eat. After what felt like an eternity, she had finally finished all five portions. She stared down at the empty plates, her eyes full of regret.\nBut that was only for a moment.\nAfter satisfying her hunger and calming her Demonic Art’s side effects somewhat, she remembered something she'd forgotten.\n‘Wait a minute, there’s still one method I haven’t tried!’\nIt was the one piece of advice she had never dared to attempt because she had no experience.\nBut now she was already backed into a corner. She had to try that advice with the desperation of grasping at straws.\nStrike while the iron is hot, as they say.\nHaving made up her mind, she tried to get up.\n\"Ugh.\"\nThe pressure from her stomach, which was so full it was about to burst, made her stop.\nLooking down at her protruding belly that seemed ready to show off, she thought.\n'O-okay, maybe after I’ve digested a little.'\nEven to a complete novice like her, it was obvious that seduction was impossible in this state.\nAbout two hours later, Xiao Hong, dressed in a clean, dark outfit to avoid being seen, slipped into the Black Dragon Pavilion.\nShe recalled the advice she’d gotten from her married senior at her old place.\nAfter giving her various tips, that senior had let out a deep sigh.\n‘You know, now that I think about it, there’s no need to make this so complicated.’\n'You mean there's an easier way?'\n'There's a simple method. Your looks are good enough to have men lining up for you, so just jump him.’\n‘!? J-jump him? What do you mean by that?’\n‘I mean just sneak into his room late at night.’\n‘And after I get there, what do I do?’\nThe senior pondered for a moment, then answered with a sigh.\n‘You have no experience, so explaining it won’t do any good. You said your target is a womanizer, right? Just leave the rest to him. Just take off your outer robe, and he’ll know what to do.’\nAs she relived that memory, she found herself right in front of Il-mok’s door.\n'Huu.'\nEven for her, this was a method she hadn't dared to try, burying it in the corner of her memory.\nBut now she was completely cornered, so she boldly opened the door and entered.\nThe sound of someone entering the room caused Il-mok, who had been deep in sleep, to snap his eyes open.\n‘Holy shit… To make a move this brazenly.'\nWhile Il-mok made a startled expression upon realizing it was Xiao Hong who had come in the dead of night...\nRustle.\nSlowly, deliberately, Xiao Hong pulled at the knot holding her robe together.\nHer outer garment slid gracefully to the floor. Having prepared herself, she took a silent, deep breath and looked at Il-mok.\nAccording to her senior's words, the Eighth Young Master would handle the rest from here.\nBut soon, she felt something was off.\n‘Wait, was a sword supposed to be part of this?’\nFor some reason, Il-mok had drawn his sword from the sheath beside his bed.",

    "content": "Chapter 145: Heartbreak (2)\nIl-mok, who had drawn his sword, was feeling just as confused.\n'Why did she take off her clothes?'\nWhy in the world would an assassin coming to kill him strip down to her undergarments?\n'Don't tell me she's hiding hidden weapons in her undergarments?'\nWith that suspicion, he carefully watched Xiao Hong's every move for a moment.\n\".......\"\n\".......\"\nHow long did they stand there, each waiting for the other to make the first move?\nFinally, Il-mok couldn't take it anymore and spoke first.\n\"...Instructor Xiao. Could you tell me what business brings you here?\" he asked with a strained voice.\nXiao Hong finally opened her mouth after much deliberation.\n\"I-I just came to the wrong room, so don't mind it.\"\nRealizing something had gone horribly wrong, she offered the flimsy excuse while hastily gathering her discarded robe from the floor. Her face was a shade of red he had never seen before.\n—Eat! Eating is the only thing that matters!\n—When you’re stressed, you need something sweet!\nThe extreme mental blow had caused her bulimia to start screaming again.\nWhat happened that night seemed like a dream, and the next day started like any other.\nBut it wasn't like there were no changes at all.\nWhenever he ran into Instructor Xiao Hong while going back and forth through the Hall of the Demonic Way, she would quickly turn around and rush off somewhere else.\nAnd during her doctrine classes, which they were forced to share…\nGlance.\nWhenever their eyes met, her face turned bright red from her face to her ears, and she'd quickly turn her head away.\n'Sigh.'\nHer reaction was so obvious that I couldn't help but notice.\nThe reason Instructor Xiao Hong came to visit last night... it wasn't because of assassination.\n'Why did I draw my sword...?'\nA strange sense of regret lingered, but it felt like a lost cause now.\nI’d basically chased away a woman who’d worked up the courage to visit me in the dead of night by pulling a blade on her. There was probably no hope now.\n'Wait, more importantly, does that mean everything she's been doing up until now was...'\nThe realization that her actions had all been attempts to seduce me naturally led to a wave of disappointment. But then…\n'No, hold on. Something about this isn’t right...'\nI hadn't done anything, so why would a woman I’d just met suddenly throw herself at me? I’ve never lived the kind of life where my face alone was enough to make a pornhwa plot happen.\nNaturally, suspicion started bubbling up.\n'Besides, I'm only sixteen and Instructor Xiao must be over thirty, judging by her position alone. Don’t tell me… she’s into that sort of thing?'\nA shiver went down my spine. Suddenly, I felt pretty good about chasing her out with a sword.\nI had narrowly avoided getting tangled up with a pedophile.\nThanks to this shift in thinking, I could actually breathe a sigh of relief.\nIt was the classic sour grapes strategy.\nAfter the classes ended, it was time to head to club activities.\nBang Mi-hwa and Ha Young were walking together with Ju Seo-yeon, who belonged to the same club.\n\"Mi-hwa, don’t you think Instructor Xiao has been acting a little strange lately?”\nAs usual, Ha Young was chattering away to her friend Bang Mi-hwa about whatever gossip came to mind.\n\"Or maybe not? She was a little weird from the start, wasn't she? The way she was giving Young Master Il-mok the eye on the very first day was pretty intense, don't you think?\"\n\"Young Master Il-mok is a man worthy of being my partner, so it’s hardly surprising that Instructor Xiao would fall for him.\"\n\"Doesn't it bother you? He's someone you've set your sights on, but for an instructor to act that way isn't right.\"\n\"Hohohoho. Rather than being bothered, I feel sorry for her, if anything. It’s a crush that’s obviously doomed to fail, isn’t it? Young Master Il-mok's heart already belongs to none other than this Bang Mi-hwa.\"\nWhen Bang Mi-hwa answered with sky-high confidence with her chest puffed out, Ha Young looked at her friend with an expression of admiration, thinking 'As expected!'\nThen Ha Young's eyes fell on Ju Seo-yeon, who was walking with them.\n'Come to think of it, Miss Ju also seems to admire Young Master Il-mok when she first entered the hall.'\nRemembering this, Ha Young casually drifted over to Ju Seo-yeon. “Miss Ju, what do you think about Instructor Xiao?”\nJu Seo-yeon, who had no interest in either Ha Young or Xiao Hong, answered while looking elsewhere.\n\"Well, I don't really have any thoughts about it, so I'm not sure.\"\n\"Hm? Doesn’t Miss Ju have an interest in Young Master Il-mok?\"\n\"You mean me?\"\nJu Seo-yeon finally looked at Ha Young with a puzzled expression. The source of this content ɪs noveⅼfire.net\nSeeing her reaction, Ha Young looked equally bewildered.\n\"You always used to say it, didn't you? That after completing the Hall of the Demonic Way, you'd enter the Hidden Guard Pavilion and become Young Master Il-mok's personal attendant.\"\n\"Ah! That's right. I absolutely must become Young Master Il-mok's personal attendant!\"\nSeeing her answer with a newfound determination, Ha Young nodded her head as if she’d figured something out.\n‘I see. She was just hiding her true feelings because she lacked confidence. She’s content with just being by Young Master Il-mok’s side as his attendant.’\nHaving reached her own conclusion, Ha Young turned back to her best friend.\n'In contrast, Mi-hwa is so admirable.'\nShe felt incredibly proud of her confident friend.\nWhile Ha Young was busy comparing Ju Seo-yeon and Bang Mi-hwa, Ju Seo-yeon, completely unaware—or more accurately, completely uninterested—in what Ha Young was thinking, was steeling her resolve.\n‘Second place!! I have to get second place, no matter what!!’\nPerhaps because she had worked toward that single goal for over half a year, she who had started as the weakest in the Hall of the Demonic Way had now reached a level where she could aim for the Upper Class.\nIf she kept growing at this rate, becoming the salutatorian before graduation wouldn't be just a dream.\n\"Ehehehehe.\"\nA creepy smile spread across Ju Seo-yeon’s face as she imagined her future as Il-mok’s attendant.\nA few days later.\nChu Il-hwan was strolling through the hall leisurely, as if he were on patrol.\n'Sigh. Managing instructors isn't an easy job either.'\nNormally, managing instructors wasn't his job.\nThe Head Instructor’s role was mainly to mediate and unify the opinions of the other instructors, then report to the Hall Master or Vice Hall Master and relay their orders back down.\nBut with Vice Hall Master Yu Geuk gone and the position still vacant, his duties had been split between him and the Hall Master.\nThat's how Chu Il-hwan ended up with the additional task of managing the instructors who taught the new disciples.\nFor that reason, he had to call in Xiao Hong and give her advice.\nIt was enough to drive him crazy.\nA man who had devoted his forty years of life only to martial arts and work now had to give romance advice to a woman in her early thirties.\n'Back then, I really thought I was going to lose my mind.'\nThe side effects of his Demonic Art kept whispering that it might be better to just kill Xiao Hong and Il-mok to eliminate the source of the problem entirely.\nChu Il-hwan's steps stopped as he recalled the events from a few days ago.\n'Still, I'm glad it's been resolved well now.'\nHis gaze landed on the window of a pavilion where doctrine class was currently in full swing.\nThrough that window, he could faintly hear Instructor Xiao Hong's voice as she diligently continued the education.\n'She had gotten quite gaunt, but recently she seems to have gotten some meat back on her bones. I'm glad she's healthy.'\nChu Il-hwan nodded to himself, thinking of how Instructor Xiao Hong was slowly returning to her old self.\n'It seems she's successfully cured her lovesickness.'\nChu Il-hwan breathed a sigh of relief and turned to continue his stroll through the hall.\n\"Head Instructor Chu Il-hwan!\"\nJust then, someone called out to him urgently and came running.\n\"What's the matter?\"\nThe middle-aged man who had stopped him was the head cook in charge of the hall's dining facilities.\n“W-we’re running low on ingredients, sir. I was hoping you could request an additional supply shipment from the main headquarters, Head Instructor.”\n“Ingredients? But didn’t we just get a shipment recently?” Chu Il-hwan asked, confused.\nThe head cook just laughed awkwardly and turned his head toward the hall where Instructor Xiao Hong was currently teaching her class.\nSeveral more days passed, and a full eight months had now gone by since Il-mok and his peers had entered the Hall. And just as they always had, the eighth test arrived for the students.\n“We’ll do our best to avoid Young Master Il-mok.”\nThe test was conducted in groups of four. When Choi Woong, who belonged to the Upper Class, said this, his friend Seong Hwan, who had also been kidnapped into the Meditation Club with him, nodded in agreement.\n\"With this kind of lineup, as long as we could avoid the Young Master until the very end, we should have a decent grade.\"\nIt was a strange thing to say. No matter how much they avoided him, they would eventually end up facing Il-mok's group in the end. But they had no intention of actually trying to win against Il-mok’s team in the first place. It had somehow become an unwritten rule.\nFirst place belongs to Young Master Il-mok anyway, so we should aim for second place.\nThat's what all the disciples recognized, except for Dokgo Pae.\nAnd quite fortunately, Dokgo Pae wasn't in their group.\nThough Dokgo Pae had calmed down a bit since teaming up with Gwak Sul, the stigma remained firmly lodged in their minds.\nIf you’re on a team with Dokgo Pae, your grade is going straight to hell.\nWhile Choi Woong and Seong Hwan were psyching themselves up, Ha Young, who was in the same group, sighed regretfully.\n'They haven't been putting me in the same group as Mi-hwa lately. I should talk to Instructor Chu after this test.'\nIn contrast, Ju Seo-yeon, who was also in the same group, had gleaming eyes.\n\"Good! We'll definitely get good grades and surprise Young Master Il-mok!\"\nThree people from the middle-lower ranks of the Upper Class, and one person from the top ranks of the Lower Class.\nFor a group of four, the balance seemed somewhat off, but this was unavoidable because of Il-mok's existence.\n\"Tsk.\"\nIl-mok glanced over the three students by his side and smacked his lips lightly. He vaguely recognized their faces and names, but that was about it.\n'I think I saw them at the Doctrine Research Club last time...'\nIn other words, they were people he had almost never interacted with. The three of them, all bottom-feeders from the Lower Class, had been grouped with him.\nBecause Il-mok had grown beyond all normal standards, the instructors had essentially strapped three sacks of dead weight to him to balance the scales. And because Il-mok had been saddled with the three weakest students, the other teams had naturally ended up with strange compositions as well.\nIt was no longer possible to form teams of two from the top class and two from the bottom class like in the beginning, so this was the makeshift solution the instructors had come up with after racking their brains.\nIl-mok looked over the three who were staring at him with resigned faces.\n'They're being pretty obvious about their expectations.'\nThe 'Since we're with Young Master Il-mok, high scores are guaranteed for this test!' look is all over their faces.\n'Damn it.'\nIl-mok cursed inwardly and his gaze moved to the sword hanging at his side.\n'It's been pretty quiet lately, so it should be fine, right?'\nProlonged combat is dangerous, but short skirmishes would probably be fine, right?\nOf course, he had no reason to fight for these three. And since he’d already won first place in most of the exams, bombing this one wouldn’t make a huge difference.\nAnd yet, Il-mok knew he had to draw his sword.\nAt the very least, he had to clean up his own mess.\n\"You three hide and move around on your own. I have a group I need to deal with separately, so I'll move alone.\"\nAt Il-mok's words, one of the three who had been eagerly expecting said with a shocked face.\n\"Wh-what do you mean by that? W-we'll help too, Disciple Il-mok!\"\n“It’ll be too slow if you come with me. Every team we meet will probably run on sight, and I don’t have time to babysit you three while I’m chasing them down.”\nHaving firmly crushed the hopes of the three who were planning to just ride on his coattails, Il-mok immediately used his lightness skill and flew off somewhere.\nIl-mok, who had disappeared from the trio's sight in an instant, recalled the directions each group had moved just before the test and ran off.\nAnd after slowing down at some point, he began tracking their traces.\n'Found them.'\nHaving picked up the trail in just a moment, Il-mok moved carefully along the traces while minimizing his presence, and soon he was able to spot his target.\nShing.\nIl-mok, who had drawn his sword in an instant, rushed toward his target while using his lightness skill to the maximum.\n'Sorry, Miss Ju!'\nIl-mok's target was just one person: Ju Seo-yeon.\n'If I don't want to take you as a personal attendant, this is the only way!'\nSince he had promised to take her as a personal attendant if she graduated second, he had to prevent her from becoming second.\n\"Young Master!?\"\nJu Seo-yeon swung her spear with a shocked expression and shouted at Il-mok's surprise attack.\nClang!\nThe moment her short spear met his sword, Il-mok’s blade traced a bizarre, snake-like path, sliding past her weapon.\nThud.\nAnd Il-mok's sword, having passed the short spear, instantly pierced Ju Seo-yeon's pressure point.\n\"Young Master Il-mok!?\"\nOnly then did Choi Woong, Seong Hwan, and Ha Young call out Il-mok's name with shocked faces.\n\"Phew.\"\nWorried that a prolonged fight would trigger his side effects, Il-mok wasted no time on conversation and swung his sword again.\nWatching the beautiful, silver arcs drawn by Il-mok’s blade, Choi Woong, Seong Hwan, and Ha Young all had the same thoughts.\n'Why us again…?'\n'WHAT DID WE EVER DO TO YOU?!'\n'I really should have been on Mi-hwa’s team!!'\nAnd so, the three of them were subdued without even knowing the reason why.",

    "content": "Chapter 146: Formation Arts (1)\nA few days after the exam, the senior cadets returned from their practical training, and the Hall of the Demonic Way began to feel like its usual self again.\nThings got a little louder with the return of Baek Cheon and Mak Ho-yeol, but otherwise, nothing too special happened.\nAmidst this, Chu Il-hwan once again summoned Instructor Xiao Hong to his office.\n“You wished to see me, Head Instructor?”\n\"Please, have a seat first.\"\nChu Il-hwan greeted her with a somewhat uncomfortable tone. He glanced at her, then quickly looked away.\n'I was wrong. She didn’t get over her lovesickness; the nature of it just changed.'\nAfter several days of lazing around, she had briefly returned to her former self.\nBut before he knew it, her face started getting puffy and oily, and her previously loose uniform began to fit around her form.\n\"Ahem. By any chance, have you been feeling unwell lately?\" Chu Il-hwan finds it awkward to ask a lady whether or not she has gained weight, so he points it out in a roundabout way.\nXiao Hong hung her head low. \"...Did it really show that much?\"\n“N-no, not at all!”\nChu Il-hwan waved his hands frantically and quickly made up an excuse.\n“I-It’s fine now, but I was just concerned that if this continues, it might interfere with your duties as an instructor. That’s all.”\nXiao Hong blushed and lowered her head as hunger pangs hit her.\n“I can only apologize for my incompetence.”\nThis wasn’t the first time she’d failed a mission, but every other failure had been a learning experience, a stepping stone for growth.\nBut this time, she couldn't see even a single clue.\nAs a result, her struggle with bulimia was getting worse by the day, and she often found herself binging late at night to soothe her hunger.\nIt was a vicious cycle.\nNegative thoughts about whether it would even be possible to seduce the Eighth Young Master with this chubby body made her binge eating disorder worse.\nThen came more negative thoughts about how it was pointless anyway, which brought on another bout of binge eating.\nSeeing Xiao Hong's dejected state, Chu Il-hwan swallowed once and carefully asked.\n\"If Instructor Xiao doesn't mind, could you tell me what's troubling you so much?\"\nXiao Hong thought for a moment.\nShe couldn't reveal that she had come to the Hall of the Demonic Way with a mission to seduce the Eighth Young Master.\nBut she felt like her side effects were already at her throat, and she couldn't just keep it all bottled up.\nSo she decided to open up about her feelings, leaving out the part about Il-mok.\n\"Actually, the side effect of the Demonic Art I learned is binge eating disorder.\"\n\"Oh my...\"\nChu Il-hwan finally understood why Xiao Hong had been gaining weight lately.\n“I tried my best to endure it, but I became so angry with my own incompetence that it got harder to resist every day. And when I see my pathetic reflection in the mirror, the anger surges again, and the bulimia returns.”\n\"Incompetent? Nonsense! Everyone struggles when they first take on instructor duties. I almost caused several accidents myself because I was constantly swayed by my side effects. The only reason I’ve lasted this long is because the Hall Master was always there to stop me.”\nHearing Chu Il-hwan's comfort, Xiao Hong hesitated for a moment before speaking again.\n“But the students have already seen it all, haven’t they? The mistakes I made at the beginning, and this wretched state I’m in now.”\nChu Il-hwan shook his head at her complaint. Follow current novels on NoveI~Fire.net\n\"Mistakes are forgotten with time. Especially here, at the Hall of the Demonic Way. In a year and four months, none of the current students will even remember you like this. The new students who arrive then will only know the skilful and magnificent Instructor Xiao Hong.\"\n‘That is, if Instructor Xiao gets her act together.’ But he wisely kept this to himself.\nHis comfort left Xiao Hong with a strange feeling.\nHe was right, and his words were genuinely comforting, but there was still one problem.\n'I don't need to look good to the disciples who'll come then...'\nHer target was only one person, Il-mok.\nSince she couldn't reveal her true intentions, she had to be vague.\n“But… as a woman, how can I live in a body like this?”\nHearing this, Chu Il-hwan exclaimed urgently.\n\"What are you saying, Instructor Xiao! You are still… s-still very beautiful!”\nThe last thing he needed was an instructor offing herself out of despair over her Demonic Art’s side effects.\n\"M-me?\"\n“Yes! And besides, men who are blinded by looks can’t be trusted anyway! It’s what’s on the inside that counts, right? I thought the confident attitude you showed when you first came as an instructor was very impressive!\"\nHe just started babbling, throwing whatever words he could find at the problem to stop her from spiraling.\n“And I believe that confident person is still inside you! L-Looks aren’t what’s important! So please, bring back that confident attitude you showed us at the beginning!”\n\".......\"\n\".......\"\nA strange silence filled the office after his barrage of compliments ended.\nChu Il-hwan, who had just unwittingly complimented his colleague’s appearance and charm, and Xiao Hong, who had been on the receiving end of the praise, kept awkwardly looking at each other, then quickly looking away.\nFinding the silence unbearable, Chu Il-hwan was the first to crack.\n\"Ahem. N-now that I think about it, it's almost time for the club activities. I-I should get going now.\"\n“R-Right, me too.”\nThey both shot up from their seats and practically bolted out of his office, splitting up the second they were through the door.\nFor the two who had no dating experience their entire lives, this situation was unfamiliar beyond measure.\n'Whew. Why is my heart beating so fast all of a sudden? Is this also a side effect of my Demonic Art?'\n'I want to eat! I'm so hungry I could go crazy!'\nSo much so that they mistook it for side effects of their Demonic Arts.\nMaybe it was because his days were so peaceful, but for Il-mok, time was flying by. He’d mastered the art of flopping through his daily training like a wet noodle and using club time for a nice, long nap.\nMeanwhile, Instructor Xiao Hong also gradually found stability, thanks to regular counseling sessions at the infirmary and Instructor Chu Il-hwan's continuous care.\nOf course, Il-mok had no interest in the strange atmosphere developing between those two instructors.\nHe just had one lingering question.\n‘Wait, so she wasn’t a pedophile?’\nWhy had she been hitting on him, a sixteen-year-old, only to now be cozying up to the forty-year-old Chu Il-hwan?\n'Maybe she's not a pedophile, but her side effect is just an increased libido?'\nAs he recalled the side effects of White Hand Demonic Art, he just shook his head and dismissed the thought. He was content just being able to rest comfortably day by day.\nBut about a month later, two changes occurred in his routine.\n\"Please take care of me, Young Master!\"\nIl-mok frowned and pointed to a certain training ground.\n\"Shouldn't Disciple Ju be going over there?\"\nWhen he pointed to the opposite side of the training ground where the Lower Class's external arts training was taking place, Ju Seo-yeon smiled brightly and answered.\n\"Instructor Eun Ryeo told me that I should receive education in the Upper Class starting today.”\nHer blissful response made it difficult for Il-mok to keep a straight face.\n'Why? I even risked the danger of side effects and eliminated her first in two separate exams!'\nFollowing the eighth test’s patterns, he had gone his way to hunt Ju Seo-yeon in the ninth test too.\nThe result was so baffling that he’d immediately asked Chu Il-hwan about it during his post-test meeting.\n\"It's all because of you, Disciple Il-mok,\" Chu Il-hwan answered as if it were no big deal.\n\"...Excuse me?\"\n“You are so outstanding that we had to make a slight change to the evaluation criteria.\"\nChu Il-hwan explained with a shrug.\n\"You were the best from the beginning, but around the fourth test, you became so good that other disciples couldn't even keep up. So we're treating evaluations of disciples you eliminated early in the tests as invalid.\"\nRegular training was one thing, but during exams, Il-mok was nothing short of a natural disaster. It’s to the point where the result of the exams was irrelevant and the rankings came out based on the order in which Il-mok caught people instead of based on the skills they displayed in the exam.\n“So we evaluated them based on their performance during regular training instead. In Disciple Ju Seo-yeon’s case, the skill she displayed in the seventh exam, combined with her performance in regular classes, indicated that she is up to par with students of the Upper Class, hence her promotion.”\nChu Il-hwan spoke as if comforting him.\n“This decision was made for your sake.”\nIl-mok scowled after hearing that.\n“This is our way of telling you to do the exam without any worries. Don’t worry the other students too much, your instructors got it all handled well. So rest assured,” Chu Il-hwan comforted.\n“…If you’re going to be that considerate, couldn’t you just excuse me from the exams entirely?”\nHis mastery of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword had become so advanced that every time he swung his sword, it felt like walking on thin ice. So he would have much preferred to be exempt, but…\n\"Sorry, but the Hall Master refused that. He said we can't give too many special privileges to one disciple.\"\nSince it’s the Hall Master’s order, Il-mok had no choice but to give up.\nUnless he borrowed his master's influence, it would be impossible to persuade that stubborn old man.\nWith a sigh, he left the hall and looked at the training ground.\n‘How come everyone left is a familiar face now?’\nDokgo Pae and Gwak Sul. Bang Mi-hwa and Ha Young. Jeong Hyeon and Ju Seo-yeon.\nLooking over those faces, Il-mok nodded in understanding.\n'I guess it makes sense. The crazier you are, the better you are at Demonic Arts.'\nHe had completely forgotten the fact that he was the undisputed top among them all.\nThen Il-mok's gaze reached the three stooges of his club.\n'But how are those guys still here?'\nDo they have some madness I don't know about?\nAs Il-mok stared at them suspiciously, the three nervously averted their gazes.\nJust making eye contact with Il-mok made the trio break into cold sweats with a creeping sense of doom.\nAfter the morning routine was done, the second change greeted Il-mok.\nIt was normally Instructor Eun Ryeo’s non-combat class time, but for some reason, a young man was standing beside her.\nHe looked to be around thirty and had a scholarly air about him.\n\"This is Acting Instructor An Jeok-un who has been dispatched from the Eight Trigrams Hall to conduct class on Formation Arts for the next three months.\"\nThe scholarly man stepped forward and spoke.\n\"I am An Jeok-un, Master of the Thunder Wind Chamber from the Eight Trigrams Hall. Thunder Wind Chamber Master, Chamber Master, Instructor, Acting Instructor—you can call me by any title, so feel free to use whatever is comfortable.”\nAt An Jeok-un's introduction, Il-mok raised his hand with a reluctant expression.\n\"I am Il-mok, a disciple of the Hall of the Demonic Way. I have one question, Thunder Wind Chamber Master.\"\nConsidering the attitude he usually showed during education time, this could be called a miraculous sight.\nIl-mok was the one who usually attended class with the enthusiasm of a cow being led to the slaughterhouse.\nAnd An Jeok-un, hearing Il-mok's name, instantly lit up his eyes.\n'So this is the famous Eighth Young Master.'\nYou could say that the one who wielded the greatest influence within the cult after the Heavenly Demon was this young man before him, Il-mok.\nAn Jeok-un wondered what kind of question the famous Eighth Young Master would ask.\n\"Ask away.\"\n“I am well aware of the importance of Formations. But why are we only learning about them now, nine months into our time at the Hall?”\nNo one in the entire Hall felt the importance of formations more keenly than Il-mok among his peers.\n‘If I had known about Formations, I never would have ended up in the Peach Blossom Ridge!’\nIl-mok was so frustrated about why they were only teaching Formation Arts now that he couldn't help but ask.\nAn Jeok-un hid his interest and answered in a nonchalant tone.\n“First, I would like to correct one thing. I said I'd teach Formation arts, but I'm not teaching how to use Formation arts. I'm teaching how to notice and deal with Formations. Formation Arts are complex and mysterious; they're not something you can learn with just three months of classes.\"\nLike a true scholar, he clarified the potential misunderstanding before answering Il-mok’s question.\n“As for why the education on this subject was delayed, the reason is simple. First, many cadets, like that one over there, have no interest in formations,” he said while casually pointing to Dokgo Pae.\nDokgo Pae, who was openly yawning, had an attitude of 'If you're a man, you charge straight ahead! I don't need any damn Formations!’\nBut even though Dokgo Pae was being so brazenly disrespectful, An Jeok-un seemed completely unfazed and turned back to Il-mok. “And the second reason is that if we teach Formations from the beginning, accidents tend to happen frequently.”\n\"What kind of accidents?\"\nAn Jeok-un answered, “There are always some who, in an attempt to use their half-baked knowledge of Formations, end up breaking the Formations laid out in the exam grounds.”\nBasically, because the students kept breaking the exam Formations, they decided to teach it at the very end.\nAfter these three months, they’d be second-year doing field training outside the Hall anyway.\nAt An Jeok-un's logical explanation, Il-mok nodded and thought.\n‘I’ve felt this before, but this place is no different from the military. Damn it.’\nIt was the same boneheaded logic the military used when they’d ban chopsticks because someone tried to use them as a weapon, or take away your shoelaces because one guy tried to hang himself with them.",

    "content": "Chapter 147: Formation Arts (2)\nAfter answering Il-mok's question, An Jeok-un spoke in a nonchalant tone.\n“If there are no more questions, let’s begin. Today, we’ll cover one of the most basic Formations, the Illusory Dream Formation.\"\nAn Jeok-un swept his gaze across the training ground and picked up a few stones before circling the training ground.\n\"I'll set up an Illusory Dream Formation that will last for the duration of our class. Watch carefully. It'll be especially helpful if you focus your qi perception to feel how the energy flow changes.\"\nHe didn’t even look at the disciples and just walked the perimeter of the training ground, placing stones in a few spots.\n\"Hmm.\"\nAfter surveying the area as if reading the qi flow, he nodded once and returned to the first stone he’d put down.\nHe pulled a blank talisman and a brush from his sleeve, then dipped the brush into a gourd hanging at his waist.\n‘That doesn't look like ink. What is it?’\nThe brush came out stained a dark blood-red and An Jeok-un started painting on the talisman with it.\nIl-mok's eyes lit up as he followed An Jeok-un's advice to sense the qi flow.\n‘Interesting.’\nA thread of qi was emitted from An Jeok-un’s fingertips and sank into the talisman with every single brushstroke.\nAn Jeok-un stuck the talisman to the rock, then continued making a new one for each stone.\nA couple of the other disciples from the Hall of the Demonic Way watched with interest.\nEach time An Jeok-un attached a talisman to a stone, they could feel the qi flow in the area subtly distorting.\nWith every new talisman, the qi became more unstable until it thrashed around like a wild animal. And by the time he slapped down the last one, it was at a fever pitch.\nThen, An Jeok-un stepped outside the strange polygonal area created by the stones and suddenly began moving his hands through the air, forming hand seals as if performing some ritual.\nThe qi that gathered around him in response to his hand seals transformed into lightning the moment he thrust his hand forward, striking the first stone with its talisman.\nPop!\nImmediately after, the chaotic qi flow stabilized.\nThe whole setup took maybe a few minutes.\nAn Jeok-un finally turned to face the students again.\n\"Hmm. Since Disciple Il-mok is the only student whose name I know so far. I ask you, Disciple Il-mok, have you noticed anything? Tell me what you observed.\"\nIt was an odd question.\nThe chaotic qi had stabilized, and from the outside, the training ground looked like a normal yard with some rocks with paper stuck to them.\n‘He isn’t asking about the stones with talismans on them.’\nIl-mok figured he’d sound like a world-class moron if he said that.\nHe didn't need long to figure out the real answer.\n“The flow of qi inside the Formation you built and the flow outside it are separate now. They're not connected at all.”\nAn Jeok-un nodded.\n\"Correct. I made it obvious so you could feel it. The rest of you should be able to notice it too if you just pay attention for once.”\nA few disciples nodded like they knew all along while a few others went “ohhh” like a lightbulb finally went on.\n\"Of course, a proper Formation wouldn't be this obvious since you need to trap your opponents inside. You could make it huge so the boundary between inside and outside can't be distinguished, or make the Formation much more complex so it blends in with the world’s natural energy.”\n\"Then why start with a useless, obvious formation like this?\" Dokgo Pae asked, looking utterly confused.\nAn Jeok-un answered in his dry tone, \"You have to start with Formations you can notice and feel before you can deal with subtle ones later.\"\nWhile An Jeok-un answered kindly, he was thinking something else entirely inside.\n‘What a complete moron.’\nHe'd explicitly advised them to feel the qi flow at the beginning. Anyone with half a brain should be able to figure out his intention from that.\nAs a member of the An Family—a clan known for its sharp intellect—he simply couldn’t fathom how the heir to the Dokgo Family even managed to survive.\nBut since he'd already known the Dokgo heir would be among the students, he decided to just let it slide. Getting worked up about it would only waste his own energy.\n“The Illusionary Dream Formation creates illusions, just as the name implies. Now I’ll teach you how to escape it. Memorize the method, then each of you will go in one by one and find your way out.”\nAn Jeok-un calmly explained how to detect artificial qi flows within a Formation and how to use those flows to find the Life Gate. Check latest chapters at n0velfire.net\n\"Even though the qi flow appears stable, it's still artificial. A better formation would hide that fakery, but spotting it gets easier once you know what you’re looking for.”\nAfter explaining how to find the Life Gate, An Jeok-un gave them a final warning.\n\"The Illusory Dream Formation I've created is the most basic type; it shows everyone the same illusion. Also, even if you get hurt by the illusions, you won't actually be injured, so don't worry. You're more likely to hurt yourself by panicking.”\nA proper Illusory Dream Formation could slip into someone's Upper Dantian to resurrect their worst nightmare, or make injuries from illusions manifest on the real body, among other effects.\nOf course, he didn’t create such a vicious Formation for the students' first practice.\nIt wasn’t because he was compassionate. The people of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult weren't exactly sticklers for safety.\n‘I could manage with other materials, but making it with just talismans doesn't give me enough time.’\nHe couldn't have built a proper one within the time limit of the class even if he wanted to.\n\"Also, don't trust your sense of direction inside. Even this basic Illusory Dream Formation will mess with your directional sense. If you think you can just return the way you came, you’ll be stuck there forever.”\nAfter finishing his explanation, An Jeok-un scanned the students and pointed at Gwak Sul.\n\"You go in first.\"\nHe'd been watching their faces throughout his explanation, so he knew this student was one of the few who'd fully understood everything he'd said.\nAt An Jeok-un's instruction, Gwak Sul carefully approached the Formation area.\nHe stepped through what felt like an invisible wall and vanished into the area.\nA second later…\n\"Hiiik!?\"\nGwak Sul let out a terrified scream and jumped in shock as if he'd seen something.\nFrom the outside, though, it just looked like he was freaking out at nothing.\nBut his surprise was brief.\nHe must have remembered Ahn Jeok-un’s warning because he quickly calmed himself down and began moving carefully.\nIt was a strange sight to behold.\nHe was clearly in the middle of a flat, empty training ground, but he was moving like he was tiptoeing across a narrow cliff or a rickety bridge, shuffling and taking weird, roundabout paths.\nAfter fumbling around for a few minutes, Gwak Sul finally stumbled out of the Illusory Dream Formation. Beads of sweat dotted his forehead as he let out a sigh of relief.\n\"Not bad for a first attempt.\" An Jeok-un’s flat tone made it hard to tell if that was praise or sarcasm.\nAn Jeok-un turned his head and looked at Il-mok next.\n\"Now Disciple Il-mok goes in.\"\n\"Yes, Chamber Master.\"\nIl-mok gave a perfunctory bow and approached the Formation.\n‘Tch. What a pain. But I guess I have to.’\nHe'd rather just coast through the lesson and relax, but Formation Arts was actually quite useful.\n‘I can’t let what happened back then happen again.’\nJust thinking about what went down in the Peach Blossom Ridge was enough to make him take this seriously.\nThe moment he took that final step into the Formation area—\nScreeeech!\nIl-mok understood why Gwak Sul had screamed.\nHis vision completely warped and he suddenly found himself on a mountainside with a warrior bursting out of the bushes to launch a surprise sword attack.\nWhoosh!\nBut Il-mok didn't scream like Gwak Sul. He just habitually twisted his upper body slightly and easily dodged the strike.\n‘Ambushes? Please. I’m used to them.’\nHe calmly avoided the warrior's attacks a few more times.\nThen a thought occurred to him.\n‘Hmm? Do I really need to find the Life Gate? This guy doesn't seem that strong anyway.’\nCuriosity stirred within him. What would happen if he defeated this warrior? Or better yet, could he shatter this basic formation with his swordsmanship?\nA cold sneer spread across Il-mok's lips as that thought crossed his mind.\n‘This fucking side effect is trying to get me to draw my sword.’\nDrawing his sword out of curiosity? That wasn’t him at all.\nThe moment Il-mok realized this—\n—Tsk.\nA faint clicking sound, like someone sucking their teeth in annoyance, echoed in his mind.\nHaving sidestepped the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's trap, Il-mok followed An Jeok-un's advice and began moving with his qi perception sharpened.\nMeanwhile, An Jeok-un's eyes lit up as he watched Il-mok from outside the Formation.\nHe had seen it.\nHe had seen Il-mok’s blatant sneer the exact moment he must have recognized the trap.\n‘Ho. A sneer. Does he think this level of Formation is nothing?’\nMost people would have been offended by the sight but An Jeok-un actually gets more intrigued.\nAfter all, this was just something he'd casually made for educational purposes. He knew it was pretty shoddy work.\n‘Well, he did experience the Illusory Dream Bewildering Formation at Peach Blossom Ridge, so this would seem laughable by comparison.’\nIndeed, An Jeok-un's interest grew even more about just how talented the famous Eighth Young Master really was.\nAs if to answer that unspoken question, Il-mok exited the formation even faster than Gwak Sul had.\n\"Excellent.\"\nIt was higher praise than he’d given Gwak Sul. After that, An Jeok-un acted like he’d lost all interest in Il-mok and started sending the other trainees one after another.\nThanks to the examples set by Gwak Sul and Il-mok, the others managed to find their way out without too much trouble.\nEventually, after a few more turns, it was finally Dokgo Pae's time.\nWith a swagger that screamed 'I'm not afraid of any stupid Formation', Dokgo Pae strode right in and—\n\"Hah!\"\nImmediately drew his greatsword to swing it at thin air.\nIt was in response to the surprise attack from the illusory warrior.\nMost students had shown surprise at that attack but quickly regained their composure and escaped the Formation.\nBut Dokgo Pae was different.\n“HAAAH!”\n“UWAHAHAHA! TRY AND BLOCK THIS!”\nHe shouted boisterously as if having a conversation with the illusion while swinging his greatsword.\n\"Hahaha! Excellent!\"\n“Urk!”\nHe even started using his footwork and lightness skills at full power, leaping and dodging all over the place.\nThe sight of a buff guy yelling and flailing about while swinging his sword at nothing made him look completely insane.\nAfter watching this for a while, An Jeok-un finally couldn't hold back and sighed deeply.\n‘Ugh. Damn Dokgo Family.’\nHe'd expected this, but not to this degree.\nThe bastard definitely hadn't listened to a word of the explanation before going in.\nAfter watching Dokgo Pae’s shitshow for a few more minutes, An Jeok-un finally had enough and stepped in himself.\nHe flicked his hands through the air, forming the same signs he used to create the formation.\nPop!\nWhen he thrust out his right hand, a jet of fire-qi shot out and instantly incinerated one of the talismans.\nThe moment it burned, the artificial energy flow dissipated, and Dokgo Pae, ripped from his illusion, roared in outrage.\n\"Why did you interrupt my life-and-death battle!!\"\n\".......\"\nFor once, An Jeok-un was actually speechless.\nHe barely managed to choke back a stream of curses and forced his face into a mask of indifference. \"Life-and-death battle? You were having a life-and-death battle with an illusion?\"\n\"That's right! I felt frustrated since private sparring between students isn't allowed in the Hall of the Demonic Way. But you can kill an illusion without any consequences! What better opponent could there be?!”\nAn Jeok-un frowned at Dokgo Pae's insane words and asked with a 'please tell me this isn't true' expression, \"So you kept fighting while knowing it was an illusion?\"\n\"Of course! Isn't that obvious?\"\n“I believe I stated that the goal of today’s training was to safely exit the Formation.”\n“Hahaha! But smashing the illusion to bits is just another way of getting out, isn’t it?”\n\".......\"",

    "content": "Chapter 148: Formation Art (3)\nAhn Jeok-un gave up. Arguing with this guy was like talking to a brick wall.\nHe shook his head slowly and that's when he spotted Il-mok.\nYears of experience had taught him to recognize the signs. He could tell this guy was about to dump something on him.\nJust as Ahn Jeok-un opened his mouth to speak, Il-mok beat him to the punch.\n\"Since Disciple Gwak Sul and Disciple Dokgo get along so well, why don't you assign Disciple Gwak Sul to teach Disciple Dokgo, Instructor? That would be perfect!\" The most update n0vels are published on novęlfire.net\nAn Jeok-un was inwardly impressed that Il-mok had read his intentions so quickly and turned to look at Gwak Sul.\nAside from the Eighth Young Master, Gwak Sul was the one who followed the formation training the best, so he seemed more than capable of handling that moron.\n\"Very well then. Disciple Gwak Sul, from now on, you are in charge of helping Disciple Dokgo.\"\nThe words ‘Why me again?’ danced on the tip of Gwak Sul’s tongue but he couldn’t bring himself to say them.\n“…As you command.”\nHe shuffled over to Dokgo Pae's side like a cow being led to slaughter and started explaining various things.\nHe broke down the principles of the Formation and even tried to coax and soothe him into understanding why he needed to learn it in the first place.\nMeanwhile, An Jeok-un finished repairing the Illusion Dream Formation that had been destroyed and turned to watch Gwak Sul and Dokgo Pae together.\n'He seems like a pretty sharp fellow just from the way he talks. I can’t, for the life of me, figure out why he hangs around with an idiot like that.'\nThis was completely incomprehensible for An Jeok-un who had lived a normal youth.\nHe had no idea what it felt like to suffer from Stockholm syndrome after a long period of kidnapping and confinement.\nA few days have passed since the first day of the Formation class and since then, the students have started to get the hang of it.\nEven Dokgo Pae, who struggled the most with the class, managed to keep up thanks to Gwak Sul's almost motherly care.\nThat is, if you chose to ignore the times Dokgo Pae would just snap and try to solve things with his fists again and resulting in the class being disrupted.\nBut while it wasn't obvious on the surface, there was someone else who posed the greatest risk of causing real trouble.\nTsk.\nIl-mok gritted his teeth at the sound of tongue-clicking that echoed in his mind again.\n'This sneaky bastard is constantly looking for opportunities.'\nMaybe it was because of the unique situation of being trapped in Formations, but every illusion and every maze was an invitation for his Demonic Art’s side effects to crawl out and whisper temptation in his ear.\nSince Il-mok had reached a level that was on a completely different scale from the other disciples, the scale of damage he could create was incomparably worse than Dokgo Pae throwing a tantrum.\n\"Phew.\"\nAfter escaping the combined assault of Formations and the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword today once again, Il-mok let out a deep sigh.\n\"Disciple Il-mok.\"\nSuddenly, An Jeok-un called his name.\n\"Come to my office after the classes end.\"\n\"???\"\nIl-mok had no idea why he was being singled out, but An Jeok-un didn't bother to explain.\nSo after all the training time ended, Il-mok headed to An Jeok-un's office.\n\"Come in.\"\nAn Jeok-un greeted Il-mok with his characteristically unreadable expression and gestured to an empty chair.\n\"Have a seat.\"\nOnce Il-mok sat, An Jeok-un took the seat opposite him.\n“I won’t waste time talking in circles. I’ll be blunt. What do you think about coming to the Eight Trigrams Hall after graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way?\"\nThe moment he finished speaking, a faint presence was detected from outside the office.\nNaturally, both An Jeok-un and Il-mok looked in that direction, but the presence quickly disappeared.\nXiao Hong, the source of that presence, pressed against the wall with both hands frantically covering her mouth.\n'This can't be! The Eight Trigrams Hall was after the Eighth Young Master too!'\nThis was a completely unexpected development.\n'Why would the Eight Trigrams Hall, which handles formations and sorcery, want the Eighth Young Master who hasn't even learned a single spell?'\nSure, he was a famous genius, but he had no connection to the Eight Trigrams Hall.\nAnd yet, a knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach.\n'…If they successfully recruit him, what happens to me?'\nShe would truly become nothing more than a useless sack of barley.\nThe awful thoughts made her stomach clench and growl. A stream of drool soaked the hands clamped over her mouth.\nMeanwhile, Il-mok's voice could be heard from inside.\n\"I haven't learned anything about sorcery, Chamber Master.”\nThe polite refusal calmed the hunger in Xiao Hong’s stomach, but then An Jeok-un's voice was heard again.\n“I know that. But your talent is astounding. I believe that even if you start from scratch, you’ll be more than capable of pulling your weight. I would stake my family’s name on it.”\nFor the prodigy of the An Family—a great house that stood alone in its mastery of sorcery over Demonic Arts—to bet his family’s name on Il-mok…\nXiao Hong's stomach began to violently churn again.\nWhile Xiao Hong was having a meltdown just outside the door, Il-mok was actually thinking it over.\n\"This seems like a difficult decision to make quickly. May I ask a few questions first?\"\n\"Ask freely.\"\n“Do the sorcerous arts of the Divine Cult have side effects like Demonic Arts do?”\nAn Jeok-un shook his head.\n“There are dangers, of course. You can suffer internal injuries if you mishandle the flow of energy while casting a powerful spell, or trap yourself in a formation you don’t understand. But there are no side effects of the kind you see with Demonic Arts.”\nAfter finishing his answer, An Jeok-un felt an inexplicable sense of foreboding.\n'...Is he displeased about not learning Demonic Arts?'\nThe An Family and the Eight Trigrams Hall were quite unique places within the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. Most of the people there hadn't learned Demonic Arts because dealing with sorcery or formations while suffering from side effects wasn't feasible.\nThe problem was that Demonic Arts were essentially the foundation of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nAccording to doctrine, one should become strong as quickly as possible to punish evildoers, but sorcery and Formations were disciplines that took quite a long time to properly learn and deploy.\nThat's why some warriors in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult looked down on the An Family and the Eight Trigrams Hall. They just kept their mouth shut because of the Eight Trigram Hall’s authority.\nAn Jeok-un thought he saw a flash of anger and sorrow in Il-mok’s eyes and wondered if he was one of those fanatics.\nHe was right about the anger, at least. Il-mok was fucking livid.\n'I should have learned sorcery from the beginning!!'\nWhy the hell did I learn Demonic Art!!??\nThe mere thought of that goddamn Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword and its constant harassment still made him grind his teeth.\nBut he had to be sure. Il-mok asked with a glimmer of hope. “Am I really that talented?”\n\"Hmm... I'm not sure yet if I'd call you a 'genius.' But considering how quickly you understand explanations during training and your excellent intuition for instantly finding the Life Gates in Formations, I'd say you could at least be called talented.\"\nListening to this almost made Il-mok shed tears of blood.\n‘FUCK!’\nThe intuition was obviously thanks to this body's natural talent. As for brains, while he didn't think of himself as a genius, he had some expertise when it came to studying.\nNo, he didn't even need to be a genius or particularly talented. As long as he had sufficient ability to learn, it would be fine to learn sorcery instead of Demonic Arts.\nAnything would be better than putting up with these fucking side effects.\nStill, he couldn't just leap at it.\nGetting scammed once or twice makes you pitiful, but getting scammed a third time makes you an idiot.\nIn that sense, Il-mok had already been caught up in scams twice.\n'It was like that when I was a civil servant too.'\nHe suffered for three years to pass the exam, so he couldn't bring himself to quit, then got stabbed and died and ended up in this world.\n'It was the same when I got dragged to the Demonic Cult.'\nOkay, that one wasn’t exactly his choice. It was either come here or die at the hands of his master or the Murim Alliance.\nEither way, Il-mok knew very well from experience that choosing the wrong job would ruin your goddamn life.\n\"How is sorcery research usually conducted at the Eight Trigrams Hall?\"\n“What time does the workday start? When do you usually clock out?”\nWorkload. Hours. Workplace benefits.\nHe interrogated An Jeok-un, leaving no stone unturned. And as An Jeok-un answered, he quickly realized his initial assessment had been wrong.\n‘Hahaha. His eyes are practically shining. He’s definitely interested.’\nA bright-eyed look of curiosity and hope had replaced the anger he’d seen earlier. He still had no idea what the anger was about but wasn’t about to ask. Why risk spooking a prized recruit when you were so close to landing him?\nTheir private job fair went on for a bit longer.\nAfter getting a good picture of the work life at the Eight Trigrams Hall, Il-mok opened his mouth to satisfy a sudden curiosity.\n“Ah, one more thing. The talismans and the ink in the gourd you use to make the formations… are those also produced by the Eight Trigram Hall?”\n“Hahaha! But of course. They are the tools of our trade.”\n“Paper and ink that can hold qi… that’s incredible items.”\n“Hahaha, and just as incredible to make. Take this talisman for example. We boil sulfur, dissolve various herbs into it, let it cool and harden, then grinding it into a fine powder which is then used to make the paper.”\n\"B-boil sulfur?\"\n“That’s right. And this ink in this gourd? That’s a special liquid made by adding various ingredients to a base we get from melting down a mineral called cinnabarite (朱沙).”\nFor a while after that, he enthusiastically explained the process of making sorcery tools.\nAn Jeok-un realized a bit late that Il-mok's attitude had changed.\nIl-mok's attitude, which had seemed full of dreams and hopes, had somehow become cold.\n\"Is there some problem?\"\n\"...I'm truly grateful for your kind invitation to the Eight Trigrams Hall. I did feel tempted while listening to your explanation, but one important fact just came to mind.\"\n\"Important fact?\"\nWhen An Jeok-un asked back, Il-mok answered with a serious expression.\n\"I am a disciple of the Supreme One. Of course, sorcery and Formations are also important works that act as a pillar of the Divine Cult, but as his disciple, I think I should devote myself to Demonic Art at least until I achieve Transcendence.\"\n\"Hmm....\"\nFaced with such a powerful display of loyalty to the Heavenly Demon, An Jeok-un couldn't say anything in response.\nIf he argued, he’d risk sounding like he was badmouthing the Heavenly Demon himself.\n“…Even so, continue to practice sorcery on the side just as you are now. Once you reach Transcendence, there will be more than enough time to study it seriously.”\n\"I'll think about it.\"\nIl-mok answered in a heavy tone, then soon left.\n\"Phew.\"\nA sigh escaped him.\nIt wasn't because he was disappointed he couldn't join the Eight Trigrams Hall.\nUsing his master's name had just been an excuse anyway.\n‘Of course there's no such thing as a perfect fucking job in this world. Damnit.’\nIt was a sigh of pure, unadulterated relief.\nIl-mok knew what cinnabarite was. More precisely, what came out when you melted the mineral called cinnabar.\n‘These absolute lunatics are boiling sulfur and mercury. They're all trying to die young.’\nAfter hearing all of An Jeok-un's explanations, Il-mok finally understood.\nThe Eight Trigrams Hall was essentially no different from a hazardous waste disposal site.",

    "content": "Chapter 149: Graduation Ceremony (1)\nA short while after Il-mok left An Jeok-un’s office, a hidden Xiao Hong revealed herself. She let out a faint sigh as she watched Il-mok’s retreating figure.\n“Hoo.”\nThank goodness the Eighth Young Master didn't fall for An Jeok-un's scheme.\n‘I still have a chance!’\nWhile listening to An Jeok-un and the Eighth Young Master’s animated conversation, her bulimia kept acting up and she found herself drooling with saliva. But for some reason, the Eighth Young Master, who had shown interest, had rejected the offer as sharply as a knife at the last moment.\nHaving survived this crisis, she realized something important from this whole ordeal.\n‘That’s right. If a honey trap doesn’t work, I just need to use a frontal assault!’\nJust like the Eight Trigram Hall did, couldn't she also entice the Eighth Young Master by highlighting the merits of the Law Enforcement Hall?\nShe stood there for a moment, lost in that thought as she watched Il-mok’s figure.\n\"Hmm? Instructor Xiao, what are you doing there?\"\nChu Il-hwan, who had been wandering around the Hall of the Demonic Way, called out to her.\n\"Ah...\"\nChu Il-hwan could roughly figure out the situation by seeing Il-mok disappearing beyond the pavilion and Xiao Hong's gaze following him.\n\"You still have feelings for Disciple Il-mok.\"\nChu Il-hwan muttered strangely wistfully, then felt something was off about his own words.\n‘Hm? Why do I feel disappointed…? I see. It must be because I was saddened that her lovesickness hadn’t yet been cured.’\nWhile Chu Il-hwan was diagnosing his own symptoms, Xiao Hong shouted with a startled face.\n\"N-no! It's a misunderstanding! I have no feelings whatsoever for Disciple Il-mok, Head Instructor!\"\nShe vehemently denied Chu Il-hwan's assumption but was equally surprised inside.\n‘Why am I so flustered? Right! I must be worried about my mission from the Chief being discovered!’\nRight after she yelled, an inexplicable, awkward atmosphere flowed between Chu Il-hwan and Xiao Hong.\n\" Ahem . You really have no interest in Disciple Il-mok?\"\n“I-I have no personal feelings for him, Head Instructor.”\nAn uncomfortable silence fell between them once more after this exchange.\nCreeeeak.\nWith a grating sound, the office door opened, and An Jeok-un appeared with a bored look on his face.\n“What are you two doing in front of my office?”\nStartled by the sudden appearance of a third party, Chu Il-hwan and Xiao Hong yelped in alarm.\n“I-I was just passing by!”\n“M-me too!”\nFeeling like a pair of kids caught doing something naughty, the two quickly used their lightness skill to escape the scene.\nAn Jeok-un glanced at where Chu Il-hwan and Xiao Hong had been standing, then quickly lost interest and returned to his office.\n\"As expected of the Hall of the Demonic Way, it's full of weirdos.\"\nAs a person from the Eight Trigram Hall, he didn't want to associate with crazy people suffering from Demonic Arts’ side effects. An Jeok-un, who had taken on the rather unwelcome position of acting instructor at the Hall of the Demonic Way, had only one interest . That is recruiting Il-mok to the Eight Trigram Hall.\n\"Still, his initial reaction was good. I should be able to bring a good result by coaxing him bit by bit.”\nHe conveniently forgot that Il-mok was also suffering from side effects.\nAfter Il-mok had rejected An Jeok-un’s recruitment offer, he didn’t approach Il-mok overtly, but he did try to subtly win him over.\n\"As expected of Disciple Il-mok. Studying formations is fun, isn't it?\"\n“Hahaha. If you go beyond simply learning how to break them and try to cast them yourself, it will be a whole different feeling.”\nHe’d keep talking up the joys of Formations and sorcery, trying to spark Il-mok's interest.\nOf course, his efforts were completely fruitless.\n‘Fuck. Why won’t he leave me alone? Is he trying to poison me with mercury too?’\nIt was unnerving how he would approach with a gourd containing mercury-laced ink hanging from his side.\nOn top of that, An Jeok-un wasn't the only one trying to subtly win over Il-mok.\n“While studying the doctrine is important, putting the learned doctrine into practice is also crucial. In that sense, entering the Law Enforcement Hall can be said to put the cult’s teaching into life.”\nDuring the mandatory doctrine education classes, Instructor Xiao Hong has recently been bringing up stories about the Law Enforcement Hall during her lessons. She keeps emphasizing how important the Law Enforcement Hall is and how rewarding it is to uphold the law there.\nOf course, being from the Law Enforcement Hall, it was natural for her to promote her former workplace. Except...\n‘Why does she keep looking at me when she says it?’\nWhenever she preached about it, her gaze inevitably fell to Il-mok. This was the complete opposite of how she'd been avoiding Il-mok for a while after that night's attack incident.\nUnfortunately, Il-mok was not one to be easily swayed just because An Jeok-un or Xiao Hong were trying to recruit him. Whatever the two of them rambled on about, Il-mok let it go in one ear and out the other.\n‘Once I graduate from the Hall of the Demonic Way, I'm definitely transferring to a branch office.’\nHis head was filled with thoughts of being assigned to a quiet rural branch office and living a leisurely life.\nFortunately for Il-mok, the recruitment war between An Jeok-un and Xiao Hong ended soon enough.\n“I don’t care where you came from, but you are now instructors of the Hall of the Demonic Way,” said the Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi in a stern voice. Xiao Hong bowed her head deeply while An Jeok-un answered indifferently.\n\"I still belong to the Eight Trigram Hall, Hall Master.\"\n\"...Aren't you currently serving as an instructor at the Hall of the Demonic Way? Or did you perhaps receive orders from the Eight Trigram Hall to recruit students when you came here?\"\nXiao Hong barely managed to hide her startled reaction as she bowed her head, but her Demonic Art was honest.\nGrowwwwl.\nA sudden wave of hunger caused her stomach to cry out.\n\"I-I am s-sorry, Hall Master.\"\nShe blushed and offered an apology, all the while wiping the drool pooling in her mouth with the back of her hand.\nThanks to that, a dead silence fell over the Hall Master’s quarters. Feeling somewhat deflated, Yeom Ga-hwi sighed and issued a warning.\n\" Sigh . I'll overlook this just once. But if you try to recruit students to specific organizations even one more time like this, you will have to bury your bones in the Hall of the Demonic Way.”\nIt didn't mean serving the Hall of the Demonic Way for life. It meant he'd kill them and bury them here.\nXiao Hong bowed deeply and left the Hall master’s office. Meanwhile, An Jeok-un maintained his deadpan face and left.\n‘Damn smartass.’\nYeom Ga-hwi frowned as he watched An Jeok-un's retreating figure.\n‘Even his threatening methods are completely crude.’ An Jeok-un thought as he left in displeasure.\nThe warrior and the Formation master really didn't get along.\nAround the time Xiao Hong and An Jeok-un were pestering Il-mok, Baek Cheon, who had returned from field training, was having a meeting with Eun Ryeo, the club supervisor.\n\"You want to perform a play at the graduation ceremony?\"\nBaek Cheon answered confidently even when faced with Eun Ryeo’s dubious face.\n\"That's correct, Instructor.\"\nIn about two months, the graduation ceremony for Baek Cheon's cohort was scheduled to take place. And Baek Cheon didn't want to end his last day on an empty note.\n\"Our Theater Club has been practicing together for the past six months, but we have never been able to actually perform a play at all. So we want to show off the fruits of our hard work on the special day of graduation.\"\n“Are you planning to perform the play by yourself?”\n\"Hahaha. Although I'm more than confident that I could satisfy everyone by myself, there’s the camaraderie we’ve built practicing together, so shouldn’t we put on the play as a group?”\n“…And the other members all agreed to this?”\n\"Of course!\"\nBaek Cheon’s confident reply made Eun Ryeo frown.\n\"Disciple Jeong Hyeon too?\"\n\"Hahaha! I gathered everyone together the other day and asked, and not a single person expressed any objection.\"\n\"......\"\nEun Ryeo almost let a curse slip out.\n\"Do you really think Disciple Jeong Hyeon would have been able to voice an objection in that situation?”\nThe girl could barely speak when it was just the two of them. There was no way in hell she could have said anything with the entire club gathered around.\nHowever, the words that came out of Baek Cheon’s mouth were beyond Eun Ryeo’s expectations.\n“What are you talking about, Instructor? Disciple Jeong Hyeon expresses her opinion from time to time. And quite loudly, I might add.”\nBaek Cheon had witnessed it several times. When it came to Il-mok, her enthusiasm was surprising.\nOf course, she would start with a yell and end with something close to a whimper.\n\"Besides, Disciple Jeong joined the club to develop her confidence. I am certain that performing a play together at the graduation ceremony will be of great help to her.”\nEun Ryeo felt like she'd been struck by lightning.\n‘Have I been… too overprotective of her?’\nReflecting on her own actions, Eun Ryeo nodded with remorse.\n\"I'll submit a proposal to the Hall Master for this idea.\"\nIt was a decision that would have made Jeong Hyeon cry tears of blood if she had known.\nJust then, Eun Ryeo realized she’d forgotten to ask something important.\n“By the way, I believe I haven’t heard about what play you intend to perform at the graduation ceremony.\"\nBaek Cheon answered with an extremely confident tone.\n\"It's a play I created myself. Inspired by Young Master Il-mok's story.\"\nAfter the pestering from Xiao Hong and An Jeok-un finally stopped, time flew by. Il-mok had gotten used to the new Formation class, so the days just spun by like a hamster wheel.\nTwo months passed like this, and finally, the morning of the graduation ceremony arrived.\nHe finished breakfast as usual and headed to the training ground where the students were already gathered.\n‘This feels more like a high school graduation ceremony than the military.’\nThat was the first thought that crossed his mind after he saw everyone lined up in rows of ten by class and year.\nIl-mok was heading to where his peer was when he felt something strange.\n‘Hmm. Why does Jeong Hyeon look like a pitiful pup today?’\nHer anxiety seemed worse than usual.\n“Are you feeling alright?” He asked, approaching just close enough not to startle her.\n\"Eek!\"\nEven though he’d kept his distance, she reacted as if she’d been electrocuted.\n\"N-n-nothing's w-wrong.\"\nShe was definitely not okay judging by the way she was trembling.\n‘Hmm. Maybe it's because there are more people than usual?’\nThinking that, he turned my head and saw two more people who seemed weirder than usual.\n\"Ohohohoho!\"\n\"Ahahahahaha!\"\nIt was Baek Cheon and Bang Mi-hwa.\nIf Jeong Hyeon looked more anxious than usual, those two looked more insane than usual.\n‘Are they acting like that because of the crowd too?’\nThe thought process of those crazy nutjobs was truly hard to fathom.\n“Don’t worry so much. It’ll be fine.\"\nRight after he gave some words of comfort to Jeong Hyeon, who seemed particularly anxious today—\n\"Silence!\"\n\"We're starting the graduation ceremony now, so pay attention!\"\nThe shouts of Head Instructors Chu Il-hwan and Cha Eun-young echoed across the grounds.\nEvery cadet’s gaze snapped forward, and following their line of sight, they saw two figures approaching.\n\"!!!\"\nA murmur rippled through the students.\n\"We greet the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons!\"\nThe old man approaching with Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi was none other than Master.\nAll the students bowed in reverence at the sudden appearance of the living god of the cult.\nMeanwhile, the Hall Master and his Master reached the platform.\nOnce Master stepped onto the dais, he spoke. The source of this content ɪs novelfire(.)net\n“You may all rise.”\nAt Master's command, all the students rose with reverence.\n“Today, the future pillars of our Divine Cult complete their training at the Hall of the Demonic Way. I have come personally to commend you all.”\nAnd with that opening line, so did begin the long-winded old-geezer type speech.\n\"Remember that graduation from the Hall of the Demonic Way is not the end. You are still young. When you leave the Hall of the Demonic Way, it means a new beginning awaits you.\"\nA lengthy lecture followed about what kind of life to live after graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way.\n‘I'm going to lose my mind.’\nHe almost yawned without realizing it, which made him break out in a cold sweat.

    "content": "Chapter 150: Graduation Ceremony (2)\nHow long had I been secretly biting my tongue to endure this torture?\n“Hohoho. It seems my words have stretched on a bit too long. I shall end it here.”\nJust as my Master finally finished his tiresome nagging and stepped down from the platform, Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi stepped up and opened his mouth.\n“Congratulations on completing your training at the Hall of the Demonic Way.”\nAnd just like that, another festival of old-man nagging continued.\n\"You should take pride in the countless hardships and trials you've endured these past two years. However, as the Supreme One said, you must remember that graduating from the Hall is not the end of everything.”\nJust as I was starting to feel the sinister premonition that I might actually fall into Qi Deviation from the sheer effort of fighting off sleep…\nThud.\nOld Geezer Number Two finally finished his speech and stepped down.\n‘Haaaah. I seriously thought I was going to lose my mind.’\nBut now that all the official events were over, I could finally go back to the Black Dragon Pavilion and rest, right?\nJust as I was clinging to that beautiful hope, Instructor Eun Ryeo’s voice rang out.\n“And now, we conclude this joyous day with a play presented by the Theater Club.”\n\"???\"\nQuestion marks materialized over my head.\n‘Was this always part of the ceremony?’\nThis was my first time witnessing a graduation ceremony at this cult, but according to what Jin Hayeon told me before I entered, the graduation ceremony was supposed to be a pretty simple affair.\n'Besides, the Theater Club was only created this year, wasn't it?'\nWhich meant this had to be a last-minute addition to the schedule.\n'...So that's why Jeong Hyeon was so anxious today.'\nI turned my head to see Jeong Hyeong stepping forward with a face that looked like she was ready to die.\nAnd not only her, but the other members of the Theater Club also stepped forward.\nAs I watched the five members of the club walk to the front, I felt a vague sense of dread.\nThe feeling intensified when Instructor Eun Ryeo, having procured it from god-knows-where, slammed a wooden plank into the middle of the training grounds.\n[Oblivion Ridge]\nThe name carved into the plank was all too familiar to me.\n'No way... it can't be, right?'\nI tried desperately to ignore the ominous premonition that sparked to life at the sight of that plank. But my hopes were shattered by Bang Mi-hwa’s booming declaration from the center of the training grounds.\n“Hahahaha! So this is the Oblivion Ridge, teeming with the old fossils of our Divine Cult! But I am the Eighth Disciple of the Supreme One, a genius blessed by the heavens themselves! Why would I fear a place like this?!”\nThe play prepared by the Theater Club.\nIt was my story.\nMore specifically, it was a heavily distorted version of my story.\nThe play began with Bang Mi-hwa, playing as Il-mok, entering the Oblivion Ridge.\nFor the real Il-mok, it was a baffling start. He had stumbled into the Ridge after falling into a trap, but the Il-mok played by Bang Mi-hwa was delivering a monologue as if he had sought the place out willingly.\nAnd the first opponent she encountered was Ju Seo-yeon.\n\"Who are you to dare trespass on the sacred territory of our Divine Cult!?\"\nJu Seo-yeon, who must have prepared it beforehand, was wearing a fake white beard and had dusted her hair with white powder to look like an old man.\nClang!\nAfter just a few exchanges of words, Ju Seo-yeon and Bang Mi-hwa drew their weapons respectively and engaged in combat.\nAfter exchanging a few moves, Ju Seo-yeon recited her lines with all the passion of a wooden plank.\n“To think you could block this old man’s spear at such a young age!”\n\"Hahaha! For me, the final disciple of the great Heavenly Demon and a heaven-sent genius, this much is nothing!\"\nThat dialogue was cringeworthy enough that Il-mok wanted to crawl into a hole and die.\n‘I swear to God, I never said anything remotely like that!’\nThe Il-mok that Bang Mi-hwa was playing shared only his name and gender. Otherwise, she was just being her usual, boisterous self.\nWhether Il-mok found a hole to die in or not, the show went on.\nThe old man, moved by Il-mok’s talent, began following the Il-mok on the stage. That’s when another old fogey appeared—Ha Young.\n“And who are you!”\nOnce again, Ha Young and Bang Mi-hwa exchanged a few blows before Ha Young cried out in rage.\n\"How dare you steal this old man's Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword!\" The most update n0vels are published on novel⁂fire.net\nSaying that, Ha Young swung her sword strongly at Bang Mi-hwa, causing Bang Mi-hwa to be thrown back dramatically.\nFreeze.\nAs if time itself had stopped, Ha Young and Ju Seo-yeon froze in place, and Bang Mi-hwa launched into another monologue.\n\"Ah! How pitiful! The old souls of Oblivion Ridge all live without knowing who they are!\"\nShe acted out a deep sense of pity for the dementia-stricken elders.\n“Yes! That’s it! I shall become that old man’s disciple and take care of him!”\nAnd just like that, she gave herself a noble justification for willingly becoming another old man’s disciple.\nWatching from the sidelines, Il-mok was speechless.\n‘Damn it. I mean, I did tell Baek Cheon a version sort of like that but...'\nBack when Baek Cheon had relentlessly pestered him about what happened on the Ridge, Il-mok had spun a heavily edited tale. He couldn’t exactly tell him he’d acted like a madman, stripped naked in a stream, and prostrated himself, tricking Elder Kang into taking him as a disciple just to survive.\n\"Have you forgotten me, Master!\"\nBang Mi-hwa tricked Elder Kang into accepting her as his disciple, just like Il-mok had done. However, the process was completely different.\nThen she began to act out the part of caring for the old man.\n‘Please, make it stop…’\nWatching the play, Il-mok felt like he was actually going to die. If they performed an autopsy on his corpse, the cause of death would probably be listed as shame.\nBut contrary to Il-mok’s desperate wishes, the audience was eating it up.\n\"Ahh...\"\n“How could something so tragic…”\nEveryone watching was either sighing with pity or wearing expressions of deep admiration.\nNot only had they never seen a play like this before, but Bang Mi-hwa’s over-the-top, confident acting had a certain appeal.\nJust as the pity for the old folks on the Oblivion Ridge reached its peak, a new character appeared—Baek Cheon.\nOnly then did Il-mok understand why Bang Mi-hwa had been cast as the lead. There was no way that lunatic Baek Cheon would ever give up the starring role. The reason Baek Cheon had conceded the role of Il-mok to Bang Mi-hwa was…\n“Master! It is all a misunderstanding!”\n“Hohoho. Worry not, my disciple! This old man knows everything. I know that you took pity on Old Kang and are caring for him, are you not?”\nIt was so he could play the part of the ‘Heavenly Demon,’ the master of the cult and Il-mok’s own teacher.\nAs befitting an omniscient being, the Heavenly Demon knew everything.\n“So, tell me. What have you learned during your five days here?”\nThe story was now framed as if Il-mok’s time on the Oblivion Ridge was a trial set by the Heavenly Demon himself.\nTo the Heavenly Demon's question, played by Baek Cheon, Bang Mi-hwa, playing Il-mok, answered.\nShe listed the various ways to improve the Ridge that she had supposedly considered during her five-day stay.\n“Then let us begin changing this place together!”\n\"I shall obey your command, Master!\"\nAfter their dialogues, the two immediately sprang into action, and soon, a new character appeared.\nIt was the final member of the Theater Club, Jeong Hyeon.\nShe also had a fake white beard stuck to her face and white powder in her hair and seemed to be playing the role of someone with severe dementia who couldn't even speak properly.\nShe had no lines at all.\nBang Mi-hwa approached the silently shuffling Jeong Hyeon and did her best to care for her, ordering the other old-timers around and changing the Ridge. And Jeong Hyeon, under Bang Mi-hwa’s care, soon had both hands covering her mouth, her eyes welling up with tears.\n“Her performance… it’s so heart-wrenching…”\nEveryone watching the play was completely moved by Jeong Hyeon’s performance.\nThey believed they were witnessing a scene where an old woman was overcome with gratitude for Il-mok’s kindness.\n‘Perhaps I really was too overprotective of her!’\nEven Instructor Eun Ryeo, the club’s own advisor, was moved by the performance.\nOnly Il-mok saw the truth.\n'She's not moved. She's dying from sheer embarrassment...'\nThose tears weren't acting. You could tell just by looking at how red her face was as if about to burst. Most importantly...\n‘Please, just make it stop…’\nJust like Jeong Hyeon, Il-mok too, felt like he was about to die from embarrassment.\nDid Il-mok's desperate wish reach them?\nThe play soon reached its final act.\n\"Hahaha. This place is no longer a demonic realm where the poor souls who have forgotten themselves wander! From now on, it shall be a place of respite for the elders who have dedicated their lives to our Divine Cult! I hereby name this place the Peach Blossom Ridge!”\nWith that final cry, Baek Cheon cut down the wooden board that read [Oblivion Ridge] and planted a new wooden board in the training ground.\nCarved into it were the words [Peach Blossom Ridge].\nThe moment the grand finale ended, the audience erupted in cheers.\n\"Waaaah!!\"\n\"Long live! Long live! The Lord of Ten Thousand Demons!!!\"\n“O Lord of Ten Thousand Demons!”\nStrangely, they weren't bowing to Bang Mi-hwa or Baek Cheon, who performed the play, but to the real Heavenly Demon who was watching the play with them.\nBut as expected, a cult leader had a different caliber.\nUnlike Il-mok, whose face was bright red and worried about dying of shame, the Heavenly Demon had a completely pleased expression.\n“Hohoho. That was a truly magnificent play.”\nWhen the Heavenly Demon praised their performance, the Theater Club's five members quickly bowed.\nAnd Baek Cheon, who could be called the representative, spoke while bowing.\n“I am ashamed that my humble performance could not possibly do justice to the greatness of the Supreme One.”\nNo matter how narcissistic and attention-seeking he was, he couldn't act arrogantly in front of the Heavenly Demon.\nWhen it came down to it, he was still a faithful believer.\n“Hohoho. It was a more than adequate performance. Do not worry.”\nAfter telling them to rise, the Heavenly Demon asked Baek Cheon.\n\"The affairs of Peach Blossom Ridge aren't widely known to the world, so a play like this could not have existed. You must have created this yourselves.”\n\"That's correct, Lord of Ten Thousand Demons.\"\n\"Then, can you tell me why you prepared and performed such a play at this ceremony?”\n“It was because I wished to spread the greatness of the Heavenly Demon, Lord of Ten Thousand Demons, to the world! And I was only able to conceive of this idea thanks to Young Master Il-mok.”\nWith his answer, everyone's gaze focused on Il-mok.\nAlready dying of embarrassment, Il-mok felt like he was going to snap as everyone stared at him.\nBut Baek Cheon, oblivious to Il-mok’s inner turmoil, continued to run his mouth.\n\"Therefore, I plan to create and perform various plays even after graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way. I will turn the stories of our great Heavenly Demons into plays to preach their greatness to the masses!”\nAt those words, the Heavenly Demon stroked his beard with a moved expression.\n\"Ho. Using plays to spread the greatness of our cult and the past Heavenly Demons. I never thought of such a method. Hahaha. All this time, we have been trying to spread the doctrine using only the most conventional of methods.”\nAs if on cue, Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi, who was watching beside him, exclaimed in amazement.\n\"Indeed! So that's why Young Master Il-mok suggested that clubs should be created in the Hall of the Demonic Way!\"\nIt was a complete and utter misunderstanding.\nHe just felt sorry for the mentally ill kids suffering from Demonic Arts at such a young age and thought he’d give them a chance to enjoy a hobby.\nBut now, with everyone in the training ground looking at him with moved expressions, Il-mok couldn't bring himself to say no.\n\"Ahahaha, I-I just thought it might turn out like this.\"\nIl-mok answered with an awkward laugh and thought.\nHe just wanted this terrible graduation ceremony to end quickly.",

    "content": "Chapter 151: Field Training (1)\nJust as everyone was staring at him with expressions of pure, unadulterated admiration, a hero stepped forward to save him from his impending death by public humiliation.\n\"O Lord of Ten Thousand Demons! Though it may be presumptuous of me to say, please grant our Bodybuilding Club the opportunity to showcase what we've been dedicating to all this time!\"\nThe man who cried out while performing a full-body prostration was none other than Instructor Cheok Il-so.\nNaturally, all eyes turned to him.\nTears of emotion glistened in the eyes of Mak Ho-yeol and Dokgo Pae.\nAfter all, this might be their chance to display their hard work before this great personage.\n\"Since this wasn't scheduled beforehand, Instructor Cheok should step back for now.\"\nThe one who replied was Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi. The old man was trying his best not to inconvenience the Heavenly Demon after this commotion.\n\"Hahaha. This old man doesn't mind at all, so let's give them a chance. After watching the Theater Club's performance, I find myself quite curious about what the other clubs have been practicing.\"\nOnce the Heavenly Demon gave his permission, Instructor Cheok Il-so bowed again and called out the students.\n“Mak Ho-yeol! Dokgo Pae! Gwak Sul! To the front!”\nAs if their bodies had been itching for this moment, Mak Ho-yeol and Dokgo Pae practically flew forward the instant their names were called, followed by Gwak Sul waddling out reluctantly behind them.\nSeeing the face Gwak Sul made, Jeong Hyeon and Il-mok felt an odd sense of kinship.\nThat was the face of an ox being dragged to the slaughterhouse.\nAs if flaunting their bonds, Cheok Il-so, Mak Ho-yeol, and Dokgo Pae exchanged glances and without words—\nRIIIIIP!\nThey suddenly flexed and tore their martial uniforms to shreds.\n“To achieve perfect martial form, external cultivation is every bit as crucial as internal energy! As martial artists, we shall display the bodies we've forged over the past six months to complete our Demonic Arts!\"\nWith that proclamation, he began striking a series of poses to showcase his musculature.\nThey weren't the modern bodybuilding poses Il-mok was familiar with.\nInstead, the three of them brandished their weapons—a spear, a saber, and a sword—and moved through their forms with much care and as slowly as possible without channeling any internal energy.\nFlex. Flex.\nWith every deliberate motion, their obscenely overdeveloped muscles seemed to squirm and pulse in a grotesque ballet of bulging sinew.\n'Ugh.'\nIl-mok unconsciously scrunched his face at the grotesque sight.\nAfter the eventful graduation ceremony ended, the Heavenly Demon and Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi were having a private meeting in the Hall Master's quarters.\n\"I apologize for taking up so much of the Supreme One’s time.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon just smiled like a countryside elder.\n\"Haha, think nothing of it. The students of this Hall are the future of our Divine Cult. Watching them blossom is one of this old man’s greatest joys.”\nAfter consoling the Hall Master, the Heavenly Demon stroked his beard and brought up something curious.\n\"Actually, watching today's ceremony gave me an idea. What if we continue holding graduation ceremonies like this in the future?\"\n“…From now on, my lord?”\nWhen the Hall Master asked with a puzzled expression, the Heavenly Demon elaborated.\n\"Precisely. That boy from the Baek Family said it himself, didn’t he? That he would spread the greatness of our cult through the acting he honed in his club. The clubs are clearly bearing fruit. It would be wonderful if all the students could present their accomplishments in their graduation ceremony.\"\nYeom Ga-hwi bowed.\n“I will see to it that starting next year, all clubs are prepared to perform.”\nAt the Hall Master's answer, the Heavenly Demon stroked his beard with satisfaction.\nAnd thus, a new tradition was born at the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nA tradition that was nothing short of a disaster for all introverted students, that is, student performance.\nWith the graduation of Baek Cheon and Mak Ho-yeol’s year, the Hall of the Demonic Way was once again filled with a quiet atmosphere.\nBut this was only from the students' perspective. For the instructors, this was their busiest time.\nInstructor Cha Eun-young and others in charge of the second year were preparing entrance examinations to select new cadets, while the instructors teaching Il-mok's year had to prepare for the upcoming field training schedule.\n“Are we really going out for field training?”\n“I can’t believe we are already second-year students. The newbies will be here before we know it.”\n\"Huhu, we must show them something impressive.\"\nThat was the chatter from the Meditation Club trio hovering around me.\n“Bwahaha! Field training! At last! I finally get to leave this place and unleash my martial arts to the fullest!”\n\"President Dokgo, this is a training. We have to follow the lead of the seniors from the martial divisions.”\nThat one was from Dokgo Pae, whose only concern was to charge like a wild boar, and Gwak Sul, who was trying to rein him in.\n“Ohohoho, my only concern is that the senior might fall so hopelessly in love with my beauty.”\n\"Huhuhu, then they'll keep following Mi-hwa around, right? Begging her to join their unit after graduating from the Hall.\"\nAnd that was Bang Mi-hwa and her partner-in-delusion, Ha Young.\n\"A-aren't you nervous, Miss Ju? W-we're going to meet new people again...\"\n\"I am nervous! Graduation is only a year away! I have to make Young Master Il-mok notice me by then!”\nEven Ju Seo-yeon and Jeong Hyeon who had grown somewhat close over their long time together were caught up in the atmosphere.\nThe entire class was practically vibrating with excitement.\nExcept for Il-mok.\n\"Tsk tsk.\"\nIl-mok clicked his tongue while scanning his classmates with pitying eyes.\nHis attitude apparently piqued the interest of their instructor, Chu Il-hwan.\n\"You don't seem excited about the upcoming field training, Disciple Il-mok.\"\nPredictably, every eye in the class turned to him. But after surviving that cringe-pocalypse of a play, a little bit of staring was nothing.\nIl-mok answered in a deadpan tone.\n\"Isn't it obvious? They say leaving home leads to hardship. This will be much harder than training at the Hall, so why should I be excited when I should be worried?\"\nThese guys seemed were probably feeling cooped up, but Il-mok felt completely different.\nHe didn't even need to recall the experiences he'd had since opening his eyes in this damned world.\n'Training trips are absolutely horrible.'\nHe'd already experienced it plenty during his time as Seo Ji-hoon in the South Korean military.\nMilitary life was shitty. Really fucking shitty. But among all of it, the worst was definitely training. Especially, field training exercises conducted outside the base.\n'Can't eat properly, doing all sorts of pointless shit, no bathrooms. Can't even wash.'\nThe last two points bothered Il-mok most. Not only was it hard to properly handle bodily functions, but he couldn't even wash.\n'Urgh.'\nIt was enough for someone suffering from a hygiene obsession like him to make him dry heave and break out in cold sweats.\n\"I need to find a solution...\"\nFor Il-mok, this was a matter directly tied to survival. If he couldn't find a solution, he might actually have a panic attack and pass out.\nAs Il-mok muttered \"solution, solution\" with a tense face, Chu Il-hwan let out a curious “Hoh.” Then he puffed out his chest and yelled—\n“Hahaha! Everyone should learn from Disciple Il-mok!\"\n—and started spouting absolute nonsense.\n\"As Disciple Il-mok said, you must realize that the field training you're undertaking as second-year students is not child's play! This is training, and it will be much harder than living at the Hall!\"\nWords are all about who says them. If some bottom-ranking loser had said what Il-mok said, he’d be branded a coward. ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ novelFirｅ.net\n\"Each of you should ponder deeply like Disciple Il-mok about how to learn more during field training!\"\nBut because it came from me, the untouchable top student, my near-crippling anxiety wasn't seen as fear, but as a mindset that’s always ready for trouble.\nWhile everyone looked at Il-mok with admiration in their faces—\n'Damn it. Should I ask Physician Seo to pack me a whole jar of disinfectant alcohol?'\nIl-mok was starting to lose his mind and couldn’t give a fuck to how they saw him.\nWhile the Hall was consumed with thoughts of the upcoming training, a shouting match echoed through a grand estate on the Cult’s main grounds, one marked with a plaque reading [Baek Family].\n\"What did you just say?!\"\nBaek Un-hak, the patriarch of the Baek Family, roared at his second son, Baek Cheon.\n\"I said I'm applying to the cult's branch in the Central Plains, Father.\"\n\"The second son of our Baek Family, called one of the Demonic Way's founding families, wants to become a common grunt at a branch office instead of joining a martial unit?! Does that sound remotely sane to you?!”\nFor a man whose name meant “White and Untainted”, Baek Un-hak’s face was anything but that.\nSure, his son had been known as the Baek Family’s wastrel before entering the Hall, but he had always believed in the boy’s talent. In fact, he’d always thought the people calling his son a disaster were idiots.\nThe Baek Family's signature art, the Hundred Flower Demonic Art, inherently contained the side effect of craving others' attention.\nAs a result, most second sons who practiced it inevitably acted out to get their fix.\n‘I was so proud of how fast he was mastering the art…’\nThat’s why he’d never been disappointed by his son's antics. He’d been expectant.\n‘I’m going to give that Hall Master Yeom a piece of my mind!’\nJudging that all of this must be because something went wrong at the Hall of the Demonic Way, Baek Un-hak barely calmed his anger and said.\n\"Think carefully, Cheon-ah. If you become a warrior of a branch office, you won't be able to receive attention anymore. I will even stop paying attention to you. The Supreme One, the elders they will all forget you even exist.”\nHe tried to sound like he was reasoning with him but the content was no different from a threat.\nHe was telling a kid whose entire martial art was fueled by attention that he was about to lose his fix.\nBut Baek Cheon’s reaction was not what he expected.\n“Hahaha. Father, even if you stop paying me any mind, I don't mind.\"\nBaek Un-hak's face nearly went white with shock.\n‘My son… a son of the Baek Family… just said he doesn’t need ATTENTION!?!?’\nSomething was wrong. Seriously wrong.\n\"D-did you perhaps injure your dantian during your time at the Hall? O-or did you hurt your head?\"\nHe wondered if his son had lost the Hundred Flower Demonic Art due to damage to his dantian or head.\nBut Baek Cheon simply spread his fan with a confident snap.\n\"I've simply realized that the Baek Family is too small a stage to contain me. And I have Young Master Il-mok to thank for that.”\nWith that, Baek Cheon turned with exaggerated theatrical movements and gazed somewhere with distant eyes.\nToward the direction where the Hall of the Demonic Way was located.\n\"Young Master Il-mok? Did you just say Young Master Il-mok?\"\n\"Yes, Father.\"\n\"Is this Young Master Il-mok you speak of the same one I know?\"\nBaek Un-hak was asking who this damned friend was who had led his properly attention-seeking son astray.\nOf course, it wasn't like Baek Un-hak had never heard Il-mok's name.\nThe name had been popping up all over the headquarters for these past two years that he couldn’t forget even when he wanted to.\nBut he didn’t expect to hear that name from his son's mouth.\nAnd as the culprit who led his son astray at that.\nBaek Cheon had no interest in his father’s inner turmoil and answered with a face full of pride.\n\"If the Young Master Il-mok that Father refers to is the Supreme One's eighth disciple and heaven-sent genius, then yes. Thanks to Young Master Il-mok's advice, my eyes were opened, and I realized how shallow the well that I had been living in. Hahahaha.\"\nHearing that answer, Baek Un-hak's gaze also followed Baek Cheon's toward the Hall.\n'...The Eighth Young Master entered the Hall a year ago, so he'll graduate next year.'\nThe head of the Baek Family, one of the Five Great Demonic Families, Baek Un-hak, thought to himself.\nHe will have a talk with this Young Master Il-mok a year from now on.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 152",
    "content": "Chapter 152: Field Training (2)\nA month flew by after the graduation ceremony ended.\nThe instructors who had taught Baek Cheon and Mak Ho-yeol's cohort were busy conducting exams to select new disciples, while Il-mok's cohort was finally heading out for their first field training.\n\"Hahaha! Finally, it's starting!\"\n“Maintain the formation!”\nDokgo Pae was getting way too excited about the field training and trying to charge ahead on his own, while Instructor Eun Ryeo was trying to rein him in.\n\"Sigh.\"\nWatching Gwak Sul let out a heavy sigh, Il-mok muttered to himself.\n“Yep. He doesn’t listen to a single word anyone says.”\nIt wasn't just Dokgo Pae either. The other classmates were clearly all pumped up about this too.\nUnlike them, Il-mok had prepared his own countermeasures for this field training.\nHe'd spent over a month following the martial units around, getting ready with the bare minimum preparations to deal with his hygiene obsession.\nAfter running along the mountain paths of the Tianshan Mountain Range for what felt like an eternity and following Chu Il-hwan and the other instructors, they spotted a group of people gathered under a banner embroidered with a white bird.\nThey are the martial unit that was supposed to join them for this field training, the White Sparrow Corps.\nThe Demonic Cult had sixteen martial units in total, with each unit having forty members.\nFactoring in casualties and other vacancies, the number usually hovered around thirty-five. The number of members Il-mok could see right now was thirty-eight.\n\"I greet the White Sparrow Corps Leader. I am Chu Il-hwan, the Head Instructor of the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\n\"Haha! Welcome, Instructor Chu. I am Gak Won, Leader of the White Sparrow Corps.\"\nWhile Chu Il-hwan and the Corps Leader exchanged simple greetings, Il-mok quickly scanned the White Sparrow Corps.\nAbout half looked relatively young, while the other half appeared to be at least in their mid-thirties or older.\n'The Leader, Vice Leader, and Squad Leaders are probably all from the Hall of the Demonic Way, while the remaining ten or so are likely non-graduates.'\nIl-mok recalled an explanation Jin Hayeon had given him in the past.\nAs the premier institution for cultivating talent in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, the Hall of the Demonic Way basically gave its graduates a free pass to any department they wanted.\nMartial units, the Law Enforcement Hall, the Sacred Order, the Dark Shadow Pavilion, the Hidden Guard Pavilion, and so on.\nBut it was impossible to run all those organizations with just the Hall’s graduates since they selected only twenty people each year.\nThe ones who filled this manpower shortage were the non-Hall graduates.\nOf course, since they weren't from the Hall, most of them started as warriors in the branch office.\nThey had to start from the bottom, build up their skills and achievements, and only after turning thirty could they finally be recognized for their contributions and promoted to the martial units or the main headquarters' organizations.\n'Since they enter major organizations and agencies way too late, most of them can never climb to the upper ranks.'\nFor some reason, this system felt depressingly familiar.\n'You could say Hall graduates are like those elites who passed the 5th-grade civil service exam, while non-Hall graduates are like those who passed the 9th-grade civil service exam.'\nSince their starting point was so low, the highest position non-Hall graduates could reach was at best a Squad Leader in a martial unit.\nGoing higher than that was nearly impossible due to retirement age constraints.\n'Well, in this den of lunatics, there's probably more retirement due to death and mental illness than actual retirement from old age.'\nEven if they climbed up, they'd hit a ceiling at just being a regular martial unit member. A tiny few might claw their way up to a Squad Leader level, and you had to deal with the constant threat of death that came with the job.\nAnyone looking at it would wonder why the hell someone would want to deal with such an insane promotion system, but surprisingly, many young warriors from the branch offices dreamed of joining a combat division.\nAs fanatical cultists, they wanted to devote themselves even a little more to the cult. The source of thɪs content is novel•fire.net\nThough that wasn't all of it.\n‘If I remember correctly, once you get into a combat division or a major organization in the main headquarters, you get to live at the main headquarters from then on.'\nThat’s what Jin Hayeon had said, but Il-mok figured there was one more reason.\nIf you joined a combat unit or an organization at the main headquarters, you could get your hands on high-tier Demonic Arts.\nAnd once you learned them, you could pass them down to your children and grandchildren.\nIf your descendants had even a shred of talent, they might have a shot at getting into the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nIn the context of this cult, it was a massive opportunity for social mobility.\nThe only problem was that it was a social mobility plan that took several generations to pull off.\n‘Hmm. Come to think of it, this is probably why my Master was so quick to adopt the new education system I proposed.’\nThe current system overwhelmingly favored the children of warriors already at the headquarters since they could learn advanced Demonic Arts from an early age.\nThey even learned advanced Demonic Arts with severe side effects from childhood, so there was a line of crazy bastards waiting.\nYou could see it just by looking around.\n‘That guy over there. And that one too.’\nIl-mok nodded as he glanced over Dokgo Pae, Bang Mi-hwa, and several other fellow disciples.\nThe cult’s education system was definitely in need of an overhaul.\nSeparate from Il-mok's intention of reducing mental illness, the Heavenly Demon's goal was to find talented individuals buried in the wilderness.\n'Which makes Jin Hayeon a really special case.'\nShe was a true self-made legend, achieving what took other families generations to accomplish through her own talent and hard work.\n'No wonder Ju Seo-yeon praises her so much.'\nAnd that woman was actually Il-mok's own attendant.\n‘…Forget hard work. Ultimately, it’s all about who you know, isn’t it?’\nIl-mok thought this way, forgetting the fact that he'd done it himself and just attributing it all to his master, the Heavenly Demon.\nMeanwhile, just as Il-mok was observing the White Sparrow Corps members, the White Sparrow Corps members were also observing Il-mok.\n'So that disciple is the famous Eighth Young Master we've only heard about!'\nFor the past two years, the name mentioned most often in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult after the Heavenly Demon was none other than Eighth Young Master Il-mok.\nEven though Il-mok's portrait hadn't been distributed throughout the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, the White Sparrow Corps members could instantly identify Il-mok for a simple reason.\n'How can a mere student have an aura like that!?'\n‘Incredible… I can’t even begin to read his depth…’\nHe had reached a realm that couldn't be compared to other disciples.\nSeveral unit members were shocked to realize that Il-mok, who was only seventeen and still just a student, was already superior to them in martial arts.\nThe shock was especially great for the young White Sparrow Corps members who were Hall graduates.\n\"Hehehe.\"\nIn contrast, the older, non-Hall warriors who had joined the White Sparrow Corps after going through all sorts of hardships were wearing wry smiles.\nPart of it was the mental fortitude that came with age and experience. The other part was that they’d already had this exact shock when they first joined.\nThey’d been stunned to find that fresh-faced kids, fifteen years their junior, were already their equals or even better than them.\n\"They say there's always another sky beyond sky....\"\nAnd now, looking at those same prodigies who had once awed them gaping in shock at Eighth Young Master was truly satisfying to watch.\n“It really makes you believe in a sky beyond sky.”\nWhile the cadets and the division members were busy assessing each other, the Leader finished his greetings and addressed the combined group.\n\"Our White Sparrow Corps's mission this time is to wipe out the bandits who've been running wild recently on the route from Hami to Turpan. They're all martial artists, and since they appeared suddenly, we suspect they are from an Unorthodox Faction’s sect from the Central Plains. For the safety of the people, our goal is to eliminate every single one of them without exception, so keep that in mind.\"\n\"Yessir!\" the corps members responded with a disciplined salute.\n“The common folk are suffering at the hands of these villains as we speak. We have no time to waste. Let us depart at once!”\nThe moment the order was given, the journey began. Some mounted horses, while others simply began to run.\n‘So that’s why it looked like they were short on horses!’\nA dry, humorless laugh escaped from Il-mok’s lips as he kicked the ground and deployed his lightness skill.\nDuring the time he prepared for the Demonic Way’s exam, Il-mok had experience running around the Xinjiang region several times under the guise of \"lightness technique training.\"\nBut this case was different.\nTurpan was much farther than Aksu where Il-mok had been before.\nIt was a distance that would take a good four or five days even on horseback. It was farther than going from Seoul to Busan.\n'These crazy bastards!!'\nAfter running while cursing the White Sparrow Corps for a while...\nThe shameless White Sparrow Corps Leader who had been comfortably riding his horse at the front raised his hand.\n\"Stop! We will rest here briefly to regulate our internal energy before continuing.”\nFollowing his instructions, those who had been using lightness skills immediately sat cross-legged and began regulating their breathing and internal energy while those who had ridden horses led them around to let them graze.\nThey fed the horses water and fodder they'd brought themselves, but mostly let them eat grass growing on the ground.\nAfter a short break, the riders and runners swapped places and we set off again.\nThis time, Il-mok was riding a horse relatively comfortably and soon understood why there were only half as many horses and why they had stopped to rest earlier.\n'Most of Xinjiang was wasteland...'\nThey weren't using roads where horses could travel somewhat comfortably.\nOnce they left the grasslands, there was hardly anything for the horses to eat.\nThey took breaks frequently, and once they entered the wasteland, they fed the horses fodder and water they'd brought in advance.\nAfter a full day of riding or running, they spent the night in some nameless grassland.\n\"We'll depart at dawn tomorrow, so have a simple meal and get some sleep! The night watch schedule will be communicated through each Squad Leader and the Hall instructors!\"\nBut just as Il-mok was sighing in relief that the insane marathon was finally over, he noticed the gazes of the White Sparrow’s members.\n\"The rumors about the Eighth Young Master don't seem to be false after all.\"\n\"Compared to the other disciples, he definitely looks more relaxed. Brother Jang.\"\nUnlike the other disciples who looked ready to collapse from exhaustion, the White Sparrow Corps members who looked somewhat relaxed all had their eyes fixed on Il-mok.\nA few of them weren't just looking; they seemed to be working up the courage to use this opportunity to talk with him.\n\"Since we've met like this through fate, wouldn't it be nice to exchange greetings?\"\nSeveral unit members who had been keeping an eye on the Eighth Young Master approached him but then stopped in their tracks.\nSuddenly, the Eighth Young Master closed his eyes and showed signs of concentration, then energy waves began flowing out from him.\nThe White Sparrow Corps members who felt that energy all showed surprised expressions.\n'He really is the Eighth Young Master!'\n‘Even after a full day of riding and running, he’s training his martial arts before he sleeps! Such dedication!’\nEveryone was wearing expressions of admiration for Il-mok's enthusiasm for a moment.\nThen, a few of the more spiritually sensitive members tilted their heads, a flicker of confusion in their eyes as they realized something was off.\n“…No matter how I look at it, that doesn’t seem like he’s cultivating internal energy. Is he… casting a spell?”",

    "content": "Chapter 153: Field Training (3)\nAround the time Il-mok and his classmates were leaving the Hall of the Demonic Way for their practical training, a meeting was taking place deep within a massive building on the cult’s main grounds. On the plaque of the gate read, “Eight Trigrams Hall.” And inside, a middle-aged man and a younger man were in conversation.\n\"You've worked hard, Chamber Master An.\"\n“Well, it’s all thanks to your order.”\nChamber Master An Jeok-un replied with his signature deadpan expression to the praise from An Hyo-gyun, the Head of the Hall of the Eight Trigrams.\nHis face was blank, but his reply was more than a little cheeky. An Hyo-gyun didn't seem to mind.\nBeing from the same An Family lineage, An Jeok-un was An Hyo-gyun's nephew.\n“Hahaha, didn’t I tell you before you left? If you don’t fix that damn personality of yours, you’re going to find yourself in some serious trouble one of these days.”\nHis uncle’s playful advice couldn't crack An Jeok-un's indifferent mask.\n\"I know. My time as an acting instructor taught me that lesson well.”\n\"Oh?\"\nAn Hyo-gyun's eyes lit up, thinking his advice had finally gotten through, but his nephew's next words made him sigh.\n“It taught me that you really shouldn’t associate with idiots.”\n“Look, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but while a few of the warriors, including the Supreme One himself, can hold a decent conversation, most of the people in this cult are impossible to talk to. They’re all suffering from the side effects of their arts, you know?”\n“If I don’t have to see them, I don’t have to talk to them.”\n“And how exactly do you plan on avoiding them when both the Hall and our clan have such high hopes for you? Whether you take my position in the future or become the head of the clan, you’ll have to deal with them.”\n\"I'm not interested in being either the Eight Trigrams Hall Master or the family head. Just researching sorcery and formation techniques is enough for me.\"\nHearing his nephew's hopelessly naive words, An Hyo-gyun sighed inwardly.\nThe kid’s talent was so extraordinary that he’d become a Chamber Master in his late twenties, but that was the problem—he’d spent his whole life buried in research and training.\nYou could say he was clueless about how the world works.\nThat's exactly why he'd sent him to the Hall of the Demonic Way as an acting instructor to deal with relatively manageable young warriors.\n‘I’ll have to discuss this with the Family Head later.’\nLetting An Jeok-un spend his entire life as a shut-in researcher was simply not an option.\nIf he wanted that kind of life, he should have refused all the support from the clan and the Hall. They hadn't poured all those resources into his growth just for him to decide he would do whatever he wanted now.\nBut arguing about it here and now would get them nowhere. An Hyo-gyun decided to change the subject to clear the air.\n\"So, during your time at the Hall of the Demonic Way, did you see anyone besides a bunch of pathetic fools?”\nAt An Hyo-gyun's question, An Jeok-un's expression finally showed a subtle change.\n\"About two. I found a couple of kids who seemed somewhat useful.\"\n\"Oh. Two, you say. What kind of kids were they?\"\n\"One was a student named Gwak Sul. His qi sensitivity was average, but he was pretty sharp. I don’t know about sorcery, but he seemed quite interested in formations and mechanical traps. And most importantly, he looked useful.”\n\"Useful?\" An Hyo-gyun asked, looking puzzled.\n“He hangs around with the heir of the Dokgo Family, which suggests he knows how to handle simpletons. I thought he might be a useful interpreter for when the Hall or the clan has to get tangled up with warriors.”\n“Hoh,” An Hyo-gyun said with a look of interest on his face.\n'So he wasn't just wasting his time at the Hall of the Demonic Way after all.'\nHe was already thinking about subordinates who could serve him when he eventually rose to higher positions.\n\"So was the other one a similar type?\"\nAn Jeok-un shook his head.\n\"The other one is probably someone you know too, Hall Master.\"\nWith that, An Hyo-gyun could easily guess who he meant.\n\"Are you talking about the Eighth Young Master?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"Hmm. I'm quite curious about what aspects caught your interest.\"\n\"The Eighth Young Master's qi sensitivity was truly worthy of being called a genius.\"\n\"If you're calling him a genius, there's no room for doubt.\"\n“As for his intellect… it was tricky. Compared to what's known publicly, he didn't particularly feel like a genius. Considering his age, I’d say he was very bright, but not more than that.”\nAt An Jeok-un's assessment, An Hyo-gyun tilted his head.\n‘The kid who brought so much change to the cult is only ‘very bright’?’\nIt felt somewhat contradictory, but he decided to hear the rest first.\nAfter all, the kind of intelligence needed for sorcery and the kind needed for efficient management were two different things.\n\"So you became interested because of his outstanding qi sensitivity?\"\n\"That's what initially caught my interest, but there's a bigger reason.\" Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs novel_fіre.net\n\"A bigger reason?\"\n\"The Eighth Young Master was interested in sorcery and formation techniques. Quite significantly so.\"\n\"!!!\"\nWhile An Hyo-gyun reacted with shock, An Jeok-un calmly told him about what happened with the Eighth Young Master.\nHow he showed enthusiasm during Formation classes, how An Jeok-un had interviewed Il-mok after recognizing his talent. The passionate attitude he showed at the beginning of the interview and the words Il-mok spoke at the end.\nAfter hearing the whole story, An Hyo-gyun had a strange look on his face.\n\"As the disciple of the Supreme One, completing the Soul-Severing Emotionless Sword comes first... That's certainly reasonable, but couldn't it also be an excuse to politely refuse your offer?\"\n\"I thought so at first, but now I've changed my mind.\"\nAn Jeok-un added with a confident tone.\n\"The Eighth Young Master definitely wants to become a member of our Eight Trigrams Hall. Otherwise, why would he bother coming to me asking to learn sorcery?\"\n\"So you taught the Eighth Young Master a spell?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n“I did,” An Jyeok-un nodded, then added a strange remark. “Though I have no idea why he insisted I teach him that specific spell, and only that one.”\n\"Phew.\"\nTaking a deep breath, Il-mok closed his eyes and focused his qi perception. He was about to use the one and only spell he had managed to swindle out of An Jeok-un during his brief tenure as a temporary instructor.\nBut since only about two weeks remained, he hadn't reached the level of handling it freely.\nThat's why he had to close his eyes to block his vision. He concentrated on his qi perception and gradually blocked his other senses.\nAnd when he could feel it all, his hands began to move, slowly forming a series of hand seals.\nSwoosh!\n'Hand seals are just a means to clearly draw the flow.'\nIl-mok recalled the advice he'd heard from An Jeok-un. Ultimately, what mattered was that the qi released through his hands communicated with the qi of the world.\nFollowing that advice, the qi released through Il-mok's hands began to interfere with the flow of qi around him.\nSwoosh!\nAs the hand seals changed continuously, the flow of qi around him was altered according to Il-mok's will several times.\nGradually, the qi in the surroundings gathered around Il-mok, and when that flow reached its peak.\nSwoosh!\nWith a final hand sign, the spell was complete.\nThe one spell he’d gotten by pretending he might join the Hall of the Eight Trigrams was deployed.\nAt the same time.\nDrip drip drip.\nA strange sound echoed as a stream of water formed in front of his hands and flowed down toward a small container he'd prepared in advance.\nIt was called the Dew Condensation Spell, the most basic sorcery for handling water qi. As the name suggested, it was a spell that gathered the water qi spread in the air and converted it into water.\nLooking at the water accumulating in the container, Il-mok frowned slightly.\nIt wasn’t because he thought he’d learned a useless spell.\n'Damn it. It’s way drier here than in the mountains. There wasn't enough water qi.'\nIt was simply because the amount of water in the container was disappointing.\nMeanwhile, the expressions of the Hall of the Demonic Way’s students and White Sparrow Corps members who had gathered to watch Il-mok perform sorcery were strange in various ways.\nThey had been expecting something incredible since it was the famous Eighth Young Master.\n'Is... is that all?'\nWhile most were disappointed by the result, a few were thinking differently.\n\"Ahem. Eighth Young Master. No, Disciple Il-mok. For what purpose did you perform that spell?”\nA person from the White Sparrow stepped forward to ask Il-mok. He assumed that the Eighth Young Master had a grander purpose in mind.\nAnd just as they expected, Il-mok did have a purpose.\n\"It's water for bathing.\"\nIt was to solve his hygiene obsession.\nIl-mok answered with a look that said, Isn’t it obvious? , which only seemed to confuse the man who had asked.\nThe man asked with a sour face.\n\"Bathing?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"...You're going to get dirty sleeping outdoors anyway, and you'll get dirty again running from early morning tomorrow, so why bother?\"\nIl-mok looked at him like he was asking the stupidest question in the world.\n\"Then senior, why do you bother eating when it's just going to be digested and disappear anyway?\"\nIl-mok had tried to phrase it politely since he was talking to a senior.\n'You're going to die anyway, so why don't you just cut your throat and die instead of living?'\nHis true feelings were closer to this.\nAfter finishing the pointless exchange with the White Sparrow Corps member, Il-mok turned around and walked somewhere.\n\"Hey, where are you going?\" someone shouted as he began heading away from the main camp by himself.\n\"I need to bathe, and I can't strip here, can I?\"\nThe answer that came back was, as expected, completely indifferent.\nHe couldn’t help it. After running all day, his hygiene obsession had already reached its limit.\nActually, this spell wasn't the only thing Il-mok had prepared for his hygiene obsession.\nHe had a flask of rubbing alcohol for emergencies, of course, plus soap, a change of clothes, and even a gauze wrap to cover his face while he slept.\n'The wastelands of Xinjiang mean one thing, dust storms.'\nIt was a makeshift dust mask prepared for dust storms.\nKnowledge is power, they say.\nIt’s usually meant to be a positive thing, but for Il-mok, it was a curse.\n‘If it weren’t for this stupid Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword…’\nFor Il-mok, with his modern understanding of basic science, that martial art was the absolute worst-case scenario.\nIf someone from this era learned the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword and developed a hygiene obsession, that’s fine. How bad could it get compared to him?\nBut for someone who knew about germs and airborne dust particles, the resulting hygiene obsession was a full-blown catastrophe.\n'Getting grilled by Master and Eldest Brother is tiring enough as it is. Damn it.'\nOn top of that, whenever Master or Eldest Brother asked him anything, he kept systematically organizing things based on modern knowledge.\nHis irritation about his situation naturally transformed into irritation toward the ignorant masses.\n'Tsk. Dirty bastards. How can they even think of sleeping in this state?'\nA soft click of his tongue echoed in the quiet air.\nWhoosh.\nAn awkward silence instantly fell over the White Sparrow Corps's campsite.\nAs they watched Il-mok’s silhouette disappear into the moonlit darkness, the White Sparrow members all came to a similar conclusion.\n'...Is that really the Eighth Young Master?'\n'...No matter how I look at it, he just seems like a crazy bastard?'\n“Hmm. The Dew Condensation Spell…”\nAfter hearing the name of the spell Il-mok had learned, An Hyo-gyun stroked his chin a few times.\n“Isn’t that a spell that even ten-year-olds in our family can perform?”\n\"That's right.\"\n“Hmm. And he spent two weeks on such a basic spell…” An Hyo-gyun muttered, sounding a bit underwhelmed.\nAn Jeok-un corrected him. “It only took him a single day to understand the spell.”\n\"Oh. At that level, he's not slow compared to our family's children either. Hmm. Well, considering his age, as you said, I suppose you’re right, it’s a bit strange. Just very bright. But then why did he spend two weeks practicing it?”\nAn Jeok-un answered with a face that was hard to read.\n“It’s difficult to describe accurately. I don’t know if I should say he was increasing its precision, or increasing its size…”\n“Precision? Size?”\n\"To put it simply, on the last day of the two weeks, the Eighth Young Master filled an entire jar using the spell.\"\n\"An entire jar... Wait! Did you just say he filled an entire jar?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n“…But you said the spell you taught him was the Dew Condensation Spell, did you not?”\n\"That's right.\"\n\"......\"\nThe Dew Condensation Spell, as its name implied, was a spell to make dew condense. It wasn't a spell that summoned a waterfall to fill a jar.\nA brief silence hung between the flustered An Hyo-gyun and the expressionless An Jeok-un.\nAn Jeok-un was the first to speak.\n\"That's why I told you, didn't I? When it comes to handling qi, he's a genius.\"\n\"Ha. Hahaha. What an absurd story. Wait! Didn't you say the Eighth Young Master was interested in formation techniques and sorcery?\"\n\"Seeing you keep asking me things I already said, it seems like it's time for you to retire, Hall Master.\"\nEven in the face of his nephew’s polite way of asking if he was getting senile, An Hyo-gyun just laughed heartily.\n“Hahaha! If a talent like that were to roll into the Eight Trigrams Hall, things would get very interesting indeed!”\n\"It would be a great help to my research as well, Hall Master.\"\nWhile the aforementioned person had no such thoughts, the two of them laughed together, imagining when Il-mok might come to the Eight Trigrams Hall.",

    "content": "Chapter 154: Field Training (4)\nAfter spending a night in the wasteland covered in sand and dust, the White Sparrow Corps members and Hall of the Demonic Way disciples set off on their journey once again.\nThe unit members, who had been so fascinated by Il-mok on the first day, had started to branch out, with some of them striking up conversations with other students.\n\"Huff... huff...\"\nA White Sparrow member cautiously approached a short-haired student who was struggling to maintain her lightness skill while regulating her breathing.\nHe opened his mouth to offer some advice.\n\"When using lightness skills, you should focus your internal energy on...\"\nBut before he could finish his sentence, the short-haired disciple—Jeong Hyeon—had a complete meltdown.\n\"Hiiiiek!\"\nShe let out a scream at the sudden approach of this unfamiliar man's voice and immediately tripped over her own feet, tumbling to the ground.\nThe startled unit member moved closer to help Jeong Hyeon up, which only made her face turn ghostly white in an instant.\n“Hey! Hey, are you alright?!”\nThe unit member was about to grab Jeong Hyeon's shoulders and shake her, thinking she might pass out any second, when—\nSmack.\nInstructor Eun Ryeo had appeared and grabbed the unit member's arm.\n\"She's extremely shy around strangers. I’ll take care of her and catch up. You go on ahead.”\n\"Oh... is that so?\"\nThe unit member who had only been trying to help nodded awkwardly at Eun Ryeo's brief explanation and walked away with a bewildered expression.\nOnce the strange man was gone, Jeong Hyeon finally collected herself and bowed her head low. “I-I’m so sorry, Instructor Eun Ryeo.”\n\"I'm fine, so don't worry about it.\"\nInstead of helping Jeong Hyeon up, Eun Ryeo actually stepped back. The girl was already spooked, and getting any closer might just make her jump out of her skin again.\n\"Whew...\"\nWatching Jeong Hyeon let out a relieved sigh as she got up, Eun Ryeo pondered for a moment before speaking.\n\"I don't mind, but you'll have problems after graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way. Whether it's a military unit or anywhere else, you'll eventually need to join some organization after completing your training.\"\n\"...I'm sorry, Instructor.\"\n\"You don't need to apologize to me. It's just that you'll need to gradually adapt for that time to come.\"\n\"I'll... I'll try my best.\"\nEun Ryeo nodded once at Jeong Hyeon's response as she kept her head bowed.\n“We’d better get moving, or we’ll be left behind.”\nSince everyone else was either using lightness skills or riding horses, they had already gotten quite far ahead.\nThey ran for quite a while using the dust clouds and footprints as markers.\nFollowing the tracks and the dust cloud as their guide, Jeong Hyeon and Eun Ryeo ran hard and eventually managed to rejoin the group when they stopped for a break.\nAfter rejoining the formation, Jeong Hyeon looked around quickly and started walking with a determined expression.\n‘I-Instructor Eun Ryeo is right.’\nShe needed to practice interacting with people.\n‘I-I managed it in the Theater Club… This shouldn’t be too hard…’\nRemembering her Theater Club days, she steeled herself and headed toward where the unit member who had approached her earlier was sitting and resting.\nSince she had wronged someone who was just trying to give her advice, Jeong Hyeon decided to apologize.\n\"I'm... I'm sorry about earlier.\"\nWhen Jeong Hyeon bowed her head and muttered nervously, the unit member tried to get up, but—\n\"Hiik!\"\nSeeing Jeong Hyeon about to have another panic attack just from him moving, the unit member stopped with an awkward expression.\n\"Ahem. I'm fine, so don't worry about it.\"\n\"Th... thank you.\"\nJeong Hyeon bowed again and turned to leave.\n\"Hiiiek!\"\nShe let out another startled yelp as a different warrior walked past her even though he was a good ten feet away.\n\"Hiiiek!\"\nAfter that, Jeong Hyeon kept stumbling and nearly falling every few steps whenever she got startled. The unit member stroked his scraggly beard and thought to himself.\n‘What an interesting kid.’\nWhen he looked around, he realized the interesting sights didn't end with just that one girl.\n\"Ohohohoho!\"\nFrom one corner of the campsite came the sound of a very bold woman's laughter.\nLooking in that direction, he saw a female student covering half her face with a fan while letting out a stream of haughty laughter.\n\"Aren't you tired after using lightness skills for several hours?\"\nWhen a unit member near the woman asked this question, the fan-wielding female disciple—Bang Mi-hwa—burst into another bout of haughty laughter.\n\"Ohohoho. This much is nothing to Bang Mi-hwa!\"\nNever mind that her clothes were caked in sweat and dust, and her hair was a greasy, matted mess. She just laughed haughtily, as if none of it mattered.\nThe unit members around her looked at her with amused expressions, probably thinking it was just childish bravado from a young student.\n\"Ohohoho. As expected, none of you can take your eyes off me.\"\nHer self-esteem was, as always, shooting through the roof.\n\"That's our Mi-hwa! How can you still be so beautiful even after sleeping rough and running all day?\"\nHa Young was right there enthusiastically praising her.\nThe two of them were so brazenly confident that the warriors watching them couldn’t help but let out incredulous chuckles.\n‘Ohohoho, they keep smiling at me. They must be hopelessly captivated by my charms.’\nOf course, in Bang Mi-hwa's eyes, those weren't awkward chuckles but the smiles of men who had fallen head over heels for her.\nBetween Jeong Hyeon's shrieks, Bang Mi-hwa's narcissism, and Ha Young's shower of compliments, the rest break passed in a bizarre cacophony.\nThen the White Sparrow Corps Leader, who had been timing things with an hourglass, stood up and shouted.\n\"Time's up! Get ready to move out!\"\nFollowing the unit leader's orders, they resumed their journey. After about an hour had passed, a strange sound came from the unit member at the very front.\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"Someone's approaching.\"\nA Squad Leader, who had also noticed something, muttered to himself.\nThe moment he spoke—\n\"Finally, some real action!!\"\n—Dokgo Pae suddenly shouted with glee and started sprinting straight ahead.\n“P-President Dokgo… st-stop…”\nWith Gwak Sul by the scruff of his neck with one hand.\nBut Dokgo Pae was forced to stop before long.\n\"Stop.\"\nA middle-aged man had leaped forward to block Dokgo Pae's path.\nIt was the same man who had first raised the alarm earlier, the Squad Leader of the First Squad of the White Sparrow Corps.\n“I don’t need you to coddle me! A true warrior should grow through real combat!\"\nDokgo Pae shouted this at the man blocking his path and tried to charge forward again, but the man was faster.\nSwiiish.\nIn an instant, the squad leader's spear shot out in a blur and stopped right in front of Dokgo Pae's throat.\n“Those are nomadic tribesmen passing by, not our targets. More importantly, if you disobey a superior’s order, you’ll forfeit your head.”\nA disturbingly joyful smile spread across Dokgo Pae’s face at the man's threat.\n\"I welcome a sparring match anytime!\"\nClang!\nAs if his body had been itching for a fight, Dokgo Pae drew his greatsword and struck at the squad leader's spear, and they began to exchange moves.\nOf course, the duel didn't last very long.\nDokgo Pae may have been second in his class, but he was still just a student.\nThwack!!\nThe squad leader's spear easily found an opening in Dokgo Pae's Nine Swords of Solitude and struck his side.\n(TL Note: Reminder, the word Dokgo could be translated as Solitude. I’m using Nine Swords of Solitude and Dokgo’s Nine Swords interchangeably to ease up the narrative.)\n\"Guh...\"\nEven as the intense pain momentarily knocked the wind out of him, Dokgo Pae swung his greatsword again.\nThwack!\nAnd again, the team leader’s spear found an opening and slammed into his body. He wasn't using the blade but swinging with enough force to break bones.\nIn just a few seconds, Dokgo Pae was covered in bruises all over his body and finally collapsed.\n“Hoo… Thank you for the guidance! Please take care of me again next time!!!\"\nDespite getting the crap beaten out of him, he was shouting with the most delighted expression imaginable.\nIt was the behavior of a certified madman, but none of the students or the warriors seemed surprised.\n\"The kid who got dragged away earlier was called 'Dokgo,' wasn't he?\"\n“Hmm. I heard the heir of the Dokgo Family was in this batch. That must be him.”\n\"Seeing how he's already ignoring superior orders like that, his mastery of the Dokgo’s Nine Swords must be pretty impressive.\"\nThe Dokgo Family's batshit crazy personality was already notorious throughout the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nAnd so the journey continued.\nDuring the process of moving and resting, it was only natural that some of the Hall of the Demonic Way disciples and unit members would have episodes and go berserk due to the side effects of their Demonic Arts.\nBut when you compared the frequency, the students were having breakdowns at a much, much higher rate.\nThis was quite strange considering that the side effects of Demonic Arts get stronger as one's level increases, but it also made sense in a way.\nHumans are creatures of adaptation. If someone stays at a certain level for a long time, they naturally adapt to those side effects and learn to control them.\nThose who were greatly affected by Demonic Arts’ side effects were usually those whose levels had developed rapidly.\nThe more talented someone was in martial arts, the greater their risk of suffering from side effects.\nEven within the White Sparrow Corps, most of the more experienced members had either already adapted to their own side effects or had weakened side effects thanks to surpassing the Extremity stage.\nThat's why the side effects were particularly prominent among the Hall of the Demonic Way disciples, who were at the age of fastest growth and emotional instability.\n\"...But this batch seems particularly severe.\"\nEven taking that into account, the Corps Leader shook his head with an expression that said he couldn't get used to it.\nWhen the sun had completely set and everyone was preparing to camp for the night, the Vice Leader nodded at the Corps Leader's observation as he surveyed the scene.\n\"The last batch was relatively well-behaved, except for the second son of the Baek Family and a disciple named Mak Ho-yeol.\"\n“This year, we’ve got at least four who are just as bad, if not worse.”\nThe two men’s gazes settled on a single point in the distance.\nTo a disciple who had left the campsite and was heading somewhere through the darkness—Il-mok.\n“Hah… to be taking a bath every single night out here even in these conditions.\"\nIt turned out that Il-mok was, of course, included on their list of certified lunatics.\nThe next day, they were up at the crack of dawn and running for half the day. By the afternoon, they reached a town that was fairly large for the Xinjiang region. This was their first destination.\nSince their targets were bandits raiding the route between Turpan and Hami, they took some time to resupply in Turpan.\nThey stocked up on food and water for themselves and their horses, and visited the local branch of the Divine Cult to gather information. By the time they were done, the sun was already beginning to set.\n“The area where the bandits usually appear is wide open, with nowhere to hide. If we move as a large group, they’ll spot us from a mile away and run. Therefore, we will now split into six teams and move under the guise of merchants,” the Corps Leader explained once all preparations were complete.\nThe sixty-six of them—thirty-eight warriors, four instructors, four assistant instructors, and twenty students—were divided into six teams of eleven.\nThe plan was to spread out and advance from Turpan to Hami, sweeping the area where the bandits were known to operate.\n\"I'll distribute these signal flares to each Squad Leader. If you set them off too early, the enemies might escape, so fire them after you've gotten reasonably close or after combat has begun.\"\nIl-mok watched the Corps Leader rambling on in front with a bored expression on his face.\n‘Six squads means a one-in-six chance of meeting them. This time I might just end up taking a leisurely stroll.’\nA faint smile touched his lips at the thought of not having to fight.",

    "content": "Chapter 155: Field Training (5)\nAfter the White Sparrow Corps Leader finished his lengthy explanation, the six teams went their separate ways to find lodging and get some much-needed rest.\nTurpan was a town that had grown around a massive oasis, so for the first time since starting field training, Il-mok finally got to enjoy a proper bath.\nThe next morning rolled around, and Il-mok found himself assigned to Team One and set out.\nHis team consisted of the White Sparrow Corps Leader and four other members, Instructor Xiao Hong and an assistant instructor, and four Disciples including himself. The other three Disciples were all from the Lower Class, so Il-mok barely knew any of them.\nNot that Il-mok gave a damn who was on his team anyway.\nHe turned his head back with a look of pure longing, watching Turpan fade into the distance.\n‘Dammit. If only I could’ve just stayed there and relaxed.’\nWhile Il-mok was reminiscing about that refreshing bath from the night before, two White Crane Squadron members riding in the same wagon were giving each other knowing looks with gleaming eyes.\nThey were currently disguised as nomadic merchants traveling by wagon and horseback to maintain their cover. If they wanted to lure out the bandits they were hunting, they had to avoid using lightness skills at all costs.\nThe two corps members who ended up sharing a wagon with Il-mok had gotten a certain impression from watching him keep looking back toward Turpan.\n‘Even the famous Eighth Young Master can't help but feel nervous, I guess.’\n‘Makes sense. It's his first real mission, so he's bound to be jittery.’\nThe two nodded at each other and decided this was a perfect chance to break the ice with the young prodigy.\n\"No need to be so tense, Disciple Il-mok.\"\n\"Those bandits won't be any match for you.\"\nIl-mok turned to look at them and replied, \"I'm not really tense at all, seniors.\"\nThe two corpsmen took his reply as pure bravado and let out hearty laughs.\n\"Hahaha! I was the same way at first.\"\n“Exactly. Everyone’s like that at first. There’s no need to be embarrassed.”\n\"......\"\nEmbarrassed about what exactly?\nWhile Il-mok sat there with his mouth shut, unable to figure out what they were getting at, the two kept chattering away nonstop.\n\"No matter how much you've honed your skills at the Hall of the Demonic Way, you can't have much real combat experience.\"\n\"Exactly. Real fights are different from training. Your head might know what to do, but your body can’t help but tremble. Speaking of which, this reminds me of when I first graduated from the Hall of the Demonic Way and joined the White Crane Squadron.\"\nJust as they were about to launch into some long-winded story about their rookie days to give him advice, Il-mok quickly cut them off.\n\"Sorry, but would it be okay if I got some sleep?\"\nIt was a request that could've been considered rude, but instead of getting offended, the squadron members just looked at him like he was adorable.\n‘Hehehe. Is he so embarrassed that he's pretending to sleep?’\n‘Makes sense. Kids his age always want to hide when they're nervous.’\nThe wagon they were riding in bounced violently as it raced across the wasteland. Even if he wasn't nervous, the conditions were way too rough for sleeping. Even these corps members who'd been doing this for years couldn't easily nap in an environment like this.\n\"Go ahead and give it a try.\"\nThe guy on the right said it like he was teasing him.\nIl-mok just closed his eyes and leaned back against the wagon wall.\nAs they expected, the wagon's violent shaking traveled right through his back. It wasn't just his back; a constant stream of shocks jolted him from the floorboards beneath him. And yet…\n\"Snore... Hoooooo...\"\nNot even a few seconds after closing his eyes, Il-mok started snoring his head off.\nHis bold snoring made both men think the same thing.\n‘Huh. He's just putting on a show.’\nBut that feeling didn't last long.\n\"...Wait, is he actually asleep?\"\nHis snoring was so deep and steady, like he was using some kind of meditation technique. The two corps members couldn't help but look completely dumbfounded.\n\"...I think he really is sleeping.\"\n\"Can't tell if he's fearless or just an idiot.\"\nThe guy on the left thought for a moment before speaking up.\n\"...I'd say he's fearless.\"\n\"Looking at how he's been acting since day one, seems like he just doesn’t have a thought in his head.”\n\"That's part of what I mean. Think about all the stories about the Eighth Young Master.\"\nThe man on the right finally understood his colleague's meaning and nodded.\n\"Now that you mention it, from the Eighth Young Master's perspective, this level of mission probably isn't worth getting nervous about.\"\n\"That's exactly what I'm saying. At fifteen, he already had experience provoking and luring around the First Young Master when he went berserk.\"\nUnlike Il-mok, these two had been born into the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, so they'd heard stories about First Young Master Wi Jin-hak since they were kids.\nThe Mad Demon that made all the unbelievers in the Central Plains shake with terror. That was the First Young Master when he went berserk.\nAnd some fifteen-year-old kid had provoked that Mad Demon and led him around by the nose.\n\"That's not all. I heard he even went to the Oblivion Ridge.\"\n\"...They call it Peach Blossom Ridge now, but just thinking about going there myself makes me shudder.\"\nOnce they got to that point, even Il-mok's behavior over the past few days started looking different to them.\nHis obsession with bathing every night, despite this being his first field training mission as a cadet. That madness now seemed less like insanity and more like he was just taking it easy because the mission was a cakewalk for him.\nAnd the more they talked about it, the more convinced they became. Especially since...\n\"Snooooore...\"\nEven with the two of them chatting away right in front of his face, the Eighth Young Master wasn't waking up; he was still snoring away like nobody's business.\nIt was the result of all that dedicated nap training he'd done back in his club.\nHow much time passed as he enjoyed a pleasant dream?\n\"Damn it.\"\nSometime later, Il-mok found himself no longer in the carriage but on horseback a sour expression. They'd been taking turns between riding in the wagon and driving the horses to keep things fair for everyone.\nA constant barrage of sand and dust battered his face and clothes as he galloped across the wasteland on horseback. Il-mok had wrapped a cloth around his mouth and was muttering through it with a sigh.\n\"Still better than before though.\"\nCompared to when they'd been running using lightness skills, horses and wagons were practically luxuries.\n‘I'd be perfectly happy if we could just keep riding like this all the way to Hami. Let some other team deal with the targets.’\nAfter all, the odds were only one in six anyway, so Il-mok figured it was a pretty reasonable dream to have.\nBut his dream was shattered by the White Sparrow Corps Leader's quiet mutter from the front of the group.\n\"Here they come.\"\nFollowing the leader's gaze, Il-mok turned his head to the side and saw some group kicking up a fierce sandstorm as they charged toward them.\nLooking at that scene, Il-mok let out a deep sigh.\n\"Seriously, did some demon curse my life or what?\"\nAs soon as he muttered those words, Il-mok realized something important.\n‘Wait, my life's already been cursed by a demon. And not just any demon, but the Heavenly Demon.’\nFrom the moment he was dragged into the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, his life hadn't just been cursed, it had been completely soaked in demons from every direction.\nWhile Il-mok was grumbling about his shitty luck, White Sparrow Corps Leader quietly gave his orders.\n\"Don't panic and keep moving forward at a slightly reduced pace. When they get close enough, follow my signal and target their horses first.\"\nFollowing the leader's instructions, they continued charging straight ahead.\nBut a strange tension was starting to build between them. ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ n0velfire.net\nThe experienced corps members maintained their usual atmosphere, but the students experiencing this for the first time couldn't help but show some nervousness.\n\"Take deep breaths.\"\nWhile the corps members and Instructor Xiao Hong were giving various pieces of advice to calm down the nervous Disciples...\nNeeeiiigh!\nThe sound of horse cries and hoofbeats gradually grew louder, and slowly, the outlines of their enemies became clear.\n‘Looks like more than twenty of them.’\nThe corps members maintained their calm atmosphere, and the students showed their nervousness, but Il-mok was just looking in that direction with an expression that screamed, \"I can't be bothered with this shit.\"\nAs the corpsmen's eyes lit up at Il-mok's incredible boldness, the bandits who'd gotten close enough closed in and began surrounding them in a circle.\n\"Uwahahaha!\"\n\"Kekekeke!\"\nThey were probably trying to intimidate them, laughing loudly while brandishing their weapons.\n\"Wh-what business do you have blocking our p-path?\"\nThe White Sparrow Corps Leader was quite a skilled actor. He stammered like he was terrified, acting just like a regular merchant would.\n\"Uwahaha! You don't need to know who we are! Drop your weapons and hand over your horses and wagon, and we might let you live! But! Leave the women behind.\"\nWhen the vicious-looking guy who seemed to be their leader shouted that, the bandits around him started snickering again and spewing disgusting words with their lewd gazes.\n\"Boss! Can I have a taste of that one first?\"\n\"Kekeke. Once she gets a taste of what I've got down here, she'll never want to leave.\"\nDespite their blatant stares and crude language, Instructor Xiao Hong and the female warrior from the corps expertly acted terrified.\nIn contrast, the female student from the Lower Class had a face flushed crimson with rage.\n\"Getting all shy just makes me want to play with you even more!\"\n“Heheheh. Nothing to be shy about, little lady. It’s something you’ll experience eventually. This big brother will show you paradise.”\nWhen the young female student blushed, the bandits mistook her anger for shyness.\nWhile all this was happening, the bandits surrounding them kept getting closer.\nThe White Sparrow Corps Leader pretended to tremble with fear and made a show of putting down his weapon, then suddenly launched a surprise attack. The other cult members who'd been waiting for his signal all struck at once.\nSwoosh!!\nCountless silver arcs cut through the air. Most of the horses were taken down in the first surprise attack, but they couldn't kill all of them.\nThe cult members were outnumbered, and two of the students had failed in their surprise attacks.\nNeeeiiigh!\nThe cries of the wounded horses echoed mournfully as blood flowed everywhere.\nMost of the blood soaking into the desert sand came from horses, but there were also some bandits who'd gotten their legs or bodies sliced off when they got caught up in the attacks aimed at the horses.\nMeanwhile, the White Sparrow Corps Leader had pulled out some kind of stick that was starting to emit green smoke.\n“Let’s see how lively you are after I chop off that filthy thing between your legs.”\nInstructor Xiao Hong, who'd been putting on a terrified face, now wore a cold expression as she swung her sword at the bandit who'd insulted her.\nThe insulted female student and corps members all charged at the bandits with fire in their eyes, while the other cult members calmly moved in to attack.\nIn the midst of all this, the bandit leader quickly regained his senses and yelled.\n\"There are only eleven of them! Deal with them quickly, then steal their horses and get out of here!\"\nWith most of the horses dead, this was the best solution the leader could come up with.\nAfter all, if they just scattered and ran at this point, they'd all get caught eventually anyway.\n\"Attack!!\"\nWith the bandit leader's shout, a chaotic battle erupted.\nIl-mok’s face twisted in disgust as he looked at the two ugly bandits rushing toward him. It wasn't just because of the foul stench of sweat and old blood coming from their bodies. It was because of the whispers from his damn side effect, which was starting to act up as the battle drew near.\n‘Dammit. If I swing my sword any more than this, it’s going to be dangerous.’\n—Let's draw the most beautiful sword path in the world!\n—The sword is the brush, and their bodies are the canvas!\n—Hehehe. And their blood will make for the perfect ink!\n—The blood of horses is not enough! Let us paint with the blood of men!\nThe Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword was particularly excited since this was real combat instead of sparring.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 156",
    "content": "Chapter 156: Salvation (1)\n\"Shut up!\"\nAfter a brief moment of consideration, Il-mok finished his internal debate and launched himself at the bandits like a madman while screaming into the empty air.\n\"I knew it! You're all Demonic Cult bastards!\"\n\"You're the one who should shut the hell up, you fucking asshole!\"\nTwo bandits flanked Il-mok from left and right, swinging their curved sabers at him.\nBut instead of backing away to dodge their blades, Il-mok boldly took another step forward.\nBut for some reason, there was no sword in his hand.\n'If I don't want to draw my sword, then I just won't draw it!'\nIl-mok quickly sheathed his sword back into its scabbard, and the various martial arts he'd witnessed flashed through his mind.\nThe Asura Blood Fist of Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi that he'd recently encountered, or Chu Il-hwan's Black Thunder Demonic Palm that he'd directly clashed with. Even Jin Hayeon's White Hand Demonic Art, which he'd sparred with hundreds of times before entering the Demonic Hall, and Seol-ah's Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art flashed in his mind.\nAmong all the various martial arts he could unleash with bare hands, Il-mok chose the White Hand Demonic Art.\nBut he didn't copy the White Hand Demonic Art perfectly. From the start, Il-mok didn't handle yin energy, so perfectly replicating it was nearly impossible.\n'If I gained sword insights from fist techniques, then the reverse should also be possible!'\nIl-mok mimicked the forms of the martial art Jin Hayeon had displayed, but the intent contained within was his own understanding.\nSlipping between the two bandits in an instant, Il-mok's hands struck at their openings.\nThwack!\nWith a single move, he used a grappling technique to subdue both men by striking their vital acupoints. When he looked around, he saw the battle was proceeding quite favorably.\nSince they were outnumbered two to one, each person was facing two or three enemies, but there was quite a significant skill gap.\nThe bandits had learned some martial arts, but they couldn't compare to Demonic Arts.\nOnly the disciples who were still at low levels and lacked real combat experience were struggling a bit.\nSlice!\nWith a gruesome sound, a man let out a horrific scream as something was severed from his body.\n\"AAAHHHHH!\"\nInstructor Xiao Hong was looking down at the man with a sneer.\n\"Not so lively now, are you?\"\nIl-mok, who had been casually looking around, unconsciously felt his lower regions clench.\n‘D-Did I almost end up like that guy that night?’\nA cold sweat broke out on his brow as he remembered the night Xiao Hong had come to his room.\nThe man's agonized screams served as a catalyst.\n\"R-run away!\"\nOnly after more than half of them had been slaughtered in a short time did the bandits realize their situation and choose to flee.\nIl-mok, who was still unconsciously protecting his groin, let out a faint sigh at the sight of the fleeing bandits.\n\"Hah.\"\nIt wasn't because he found their cowardice pathetic.\n'Chasing them would be such a pain.'\nHe had no desire to chase after them. That’s when he assumed a stance.\nThe stance of Asura Blood Fist that the Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi had demonstrated in the past.\nHe infused his fist with the principle of speed he had mastered through the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, then unleashed a barrage of punches at tremendous speed.\nEach punch of his fist caused winds to shoot out like cannonballs one after another.\nBoom boom boom boom!\nA series of impacts followed, and several of the fleeing bandits went tumbling across the sandy plains.\nBut those hit by Il-mok were the lucky ones.\nRight after, the White Sparrow Corps members each swung their weapons through the air, sending various qi dancing through the sky to slice the legs and necks of the fleeing bastards.\n\"Phew.\"\nJust as Il-mok was letting out a sigh of relief after confirming that not a single one had escaped.\n\"Hahaha! Absolutely excellent!\"\nThe White Sparrow Corps Leader, who had cut off the bandit chief's head, approached Il-mok with hearty laughter.\nWith a face full of curiosity, he asked Il-mok.\n\"But wasn't Disciple Il-mok learning swordsmanship? Why did you deliberately use fist techniques?\"\nAt that question, Il-mok pondered very briefly.\n'If I said \"to avoid enlightenment,\" I'd be treated like a lunatic, right?'\nFor those who had learned martial arts, what could be more precious than enlightenment?\n'I was treated like a crazy person a few times at the Demonic Way too.'\nEven Il-mok himself knew how idiotic that sounded by now. So, after a brief moment of thought, he came up with a perfectly serviceable answer.\n\"Because they weren't even worth drawing my sword for.\"\nIt was the kind of arrogant bullshit that the crazy bastards of the Demonic Cult would find acceptable.\n\"......\"\n\"......\"\nRight after Il-mok's arrogant response, silence momentarily settled over the area.\nThe one who broke that awkward silence was the White Sparrow Corps Leader who had asked the question.\n\"Hahaha. If any other disciple had said that, I would have given them a good beating, but since it's you who said it, I'll let it slide this time.\"\nIt wasn't because Il-mok was the Heavenly Demon's disciple.\nHe turned his gaze to sweep over the bandits sprawled on the ground.\n\"After all, you subdued this many enemies without even using your sword.\"\nThere was no need to nag someone who had proven their arrogance with skill.\nInstead of lecturing him, he suddenly burst into laughter with a relieved expression.\n\"Hahaha! To be honest, I was a little worried. I wondered if the reason you used your fists was because you were afraid of killing.\"\nThe Corps Leader, who had surveyed all the bandits sprawled on the ground groaning, turned to look at Il-mok with a smiling face.\n\"These men are villains who have killed the powerless and stolen what is precious to them. If you fear even killing scum like this, how could you ever properly carry out the will of our great Cult? Hahaha! But it seems my worries were needless, which is a relief indeed.\"\nThe White Sparrow Corps Leader was still smiling, but Il-mok felt an inexplicably eerie sensation.\n'This was a test, wasn't it?'\nIt felt dangerous.\nHonestly, among the reasons he didn't draw his sword, avoiding killing wasn't entirely absent.\nEver since being dragged here by his Master, Il-mok had indirectly participated in killings or witnessed people die, but he still hadn't experienced killing anyone with his own hands.\nWhile Il-mok was internally sighing with relief, A cloud of sand billowed in the distance, and another group could be seen approaching.\nThey were Demonic Cult members who had rushed over after seeing the green smoke of the signal flare the White Sparrow Corps Leader had set off.\nThe one who showed the most conspicuous reaction was Dokgo Pae.\n\"This can't be!!\"\nHe despaired with a face as if the sky itself had collapsed.\n\"Get back on your feet, you worthless bastards! Give me a chance at a real fight!!\"\nIt was the sight of a complete lunatic.\nRegardless of Dokgo Pae’s antics, the newly arrived White Sparrow corpsmen began interrogating the downed bandits.\n\"Where are you from?\"\nIn a way, it could be said to be thanks to Il-mok.\nBecause he had fought only with his fists and grappling techniques, a good number of bandits had been subdued without being killed.\nRight after finishing the brief interrogation...\nSlice.\nThe White Sparrow Corps members cut off the necks of the bandits who had honestly spilled information.\nIt was obvious.\nThere was no reason to forgive bandits who had tormented the common people. They were followers of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, not Shaolin monks who pursued non-killing.\nAfter finishing the interrogation and slaughter, the White Sparrow Corps Leader clicked his tongue.\n\"Tsk. More runaways from the Central Plains again.\"\n\"I pity the people of the Central Plains. There's no way the bastards who fought territory disputes with scum like these could be good guys who look after the people.\"\nThe Corps Leader nodded with a regretful face after hearing the Vice Leader’s words.\n\"Our Divine Cult must return to the Central Plains soon and save the people.\"\n\"Central Plain scums.\"\nWith their conversation ending, everyone present looked east with expressions mixing regret and anger. They gazed toward the Central Plains, home to the great clans and sects, and above all, the Imperial Court that had branded them traitors.\nIn that atmosphere full of determination, only Il-mok was struggling to manage his expression.\n'Crazy cult bastards.'\nIf they found out his true thoughts, his head would roll on the ground just like those bandits.\nRight after cleaning up the entire battlefield...\n'Still, it's all over now, right?'\nIl-mok was wearing a cheerful expression.\nIt wasn't just because he had survived the crisis of having his inner thoughts exposed.\nIt was because they had dealt with the bandits who were the target of this expedition in just four days since starting the practical training.\nAnd since they'd completed their objective, they now just had to return to the Demonic Way, right?\nIl-mok's hope was mercilessly crushed.\n\"Since the mission ended sooner than expected, we'll spend the remaining time patrolling the surrounding area.\"\nFollowing the White Sparrow Corps Leader's orders, they began moving again.\nNot toward the west where the Tianshan Mountains Range was located, but toward the south.\nBut the atmosphere was quite different from before.\nWith no urgent business, they didn't push themselves with movement techniques or ride their horses at full speed. This gave both the corpsmen and the students some breathing room. Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs novelꞁire.net\n\"Hahaha. So are you planning to apply to the combat unit after graduating from the Demonic Way?\"\n\"Hmm. How about our White Sparrow Corps? We still have two vacant positions that we need to fill soon.\"\n\"It would be an honor to be able to serve with you, seniors!\"\nMaybe because they had more leisure time, they now engaged in all sorts of small talk while they traveled. The most common conversation was the corpsmen’s attempts to recruit the cadets into the White Sparrow Corps.\n\"I've been watching you for a few days, and it seems your lightness skill is a bit lacking. I don't practice the same one as you, but let me give you a few pointers.\"\nThere were also some corpsmen who offered advice on martial arts or life in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nOf course, even those giving advice would say the same thing after finishing their advice.\nHow about joining our White Sparrow Corps after you graduate from the Hall? I'll even give you some extra lessons. Hahaha.\"\nThe conversations buzzing from all sides made for a seemingly cheerful atmosphere, but there were also those being ignored.\nThe White Sparrow Corps members weren't thoughtlessly approaching just any disciple.\nThey were focusing on the ones they had observed over the past few days, the ones who seemed to have decent skill or grit.\nThanks to this, most of the disciples in the lower ranks of the Lower Class were ignored.\n\"I've long heard of your name, senior! I've always wanted to have a conversation with you!\"\nAmong them, there were also disciples who took the initiative to approach the White Sparrow Corps members.\nOn the other hand, most of the Upper Class disciples were recruitment targets for the White Sparrow Corps members, but the corpsmen were having a hard time in the process.\n\"Hiiiik!!\"\nThere was one disciple who would have a panic attack if you even approached her a little, let alone try to have a conversation.\n\"What do you think about our White Sparrow Corps...\"\n\"I'm sorry, but I've already decided to dedicate my life to the Hidden Guard Pavilion!\"\n\"Huh? Don’t be too hasty. With skills good enough to be placed in the Upper Class of the Demonic Way, choosing the Hidden Guard Pavilion as your choice of career would be a waste of your talent.”\n\"It's not hasty! My heart is steadfast. My only goal is to become Young Master Il-mok's attendant!\"\nThere was a strange cadet who, no matter what anyone said, would just repeat her desire to become Il-mok’s attendant.\n\"Ohohohoh!\"\n\"As expected of Mi-hwa!\"\nThen there was the weird student who only bragged about herself, no matter what was going on around her, and her best friend who enabled her.\nThere was even one disciple who boasted excellent grades even in the Upper Class, but whom the corps members couldn't bring themselves to approach.\nThe problem was that even though they were trying to avoid him, that disciple would come looking for them.\n\"Senior! The road is long and boring, how about a sparring match!\"\nThe corpsmen let out sighs of despair thanks to the student who kept sticking to them no matter how hard they tried to get away.\nThe eldest son of a famous family known for his self-righteous personality. He was the kind of guy who would bring disaster upon the White Sparrow Corps if they recruited him, so despite his outstanding skills, they didn't dare make an offer.\nWhile the White Sparrow corpsmen were busy mingling with, recruiting, and avoiding the cadets, their gazes would often drift toward a certain place.\nThere is a big fish among big fishes in this batch.\nAs if sensing the White Sparrow Corps members' earnest wishes, the White Sparrow Corps Leader finally made his move.\nToward Il-mok, who was snoring and dozing off on his horse.\nAnd at the Corps Leader's blatant move…\nGrumble.\nA certain female instructor's stomach began to churn.",

    "content": "Chapter 157: Salvation (2)\nLike the other instructors, Xiao Hong was offering advice to the students alongside the White Sparrow’s members.\n“If you truly wish to become a great warrior of the Divine Cult, you cannot fall so easily for an opponent’s provocations.”\nShe was advising a female disciple who had fallen for the bandits' taunts during their battle a few days ago. Although things had worked out in the end, the cadet’s face had turned beet red at the bandits’ lewd remarks.\nIt wasn't from embarrassment like a proper lady ; this was a Demonic Cult member, so it was pure rage. Still, getting worked up by enemy provocations before a fight was just plain stupid.\nFor Xiao Hong, advising this woman felt pretty weird.\n‘All I really need to worry about is the Eighth Young Master, so why am I bothering with advice like this…?’\nShe had considered the students of the Hall of the Demonic Way to be nothing more than passing acquaintances. But when she saw that female student, she couldn't help but see a reflection of her younger self from over a decade ago, and she couldn't just stand by.\nAfter that, Xiao Hong kept giving various pieces of advice to different students.\n'Right. I need to act like a proper instructor to hide my true objective of recruiting the Eighth Young Master.'\nShe justified her actions to herself as she continued helping the officials.\nBut she hadn't forgotten her true purpose. She kept stealing glances at Il-mok, who was often dozing off on his horse.\n\"!!!\" Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn novel✦fire.net\nGrumble.\nThe moment she spotted the White Sparrow Corps Leader approaching Il-mok, her stomach started acting up.\n\"Ahem. Would you like some of this?\"\nHearing that loud rumbling sound, Chu Il-hwan kindly offered Xiao Hong a piece of jerky.\n\"It's... It's fine, Head Instructor.\"\nHer face turned bright red from the sudden stomach noise, and Xiao Hong quickly bowed her head. It was hard to believe this was the same woman who had sliced off a bandit’s groin just a few hours ago.\n'...More people will keep showing up to recruit Young Master Il-mok during these field trainings. What the hell am I supposed to do about this?'\nBetween her binge-eating urges and embarrassment, Xiao Hong kept her head down while sneaking glances at Il-mok. Or more precisely, at the White Sparrow Corps Leader who was approaching him.\n\"Zzzz.\"\nIl-mok, who'd been napping on his horse, finally opened his eyes when he sensed someone nearby.\n“To be able to sleep like that on a horse. You’re quite something.”\nWhether that was praise or criticism, Il-mok didn’t care and wiped the drool from his hand.\n\"Rest is also part of self-management, isn't it?\"\nThe White Sparrow Corps Leader almost burst out laughing at that bold response.\n'Still, considering how he handled those bandits, the rumors are probably true.'\nHe'd seen it with his own eyes, and his men's accounts all matched up.\nNot just his martial arts, but the boldness he'd shown in the process.\n'Sleeping so carelessly on his horse is probably just another sign of that boldness.'\nConvincing himself of this, the Corps Leader casually started a conversation.\n\"So, what do you think of your time with our White Sparrow Corps these past few days?\"\nIl-mok had to hide his true feelings at that question.\nHe couldn't exactly say, \"It's been disgusting being with you people, and I hope we never meet again.\"\nThis field training had made Il-mok absolutely certain of one thing.\nAfter graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way, he would never, ever join a combat unit.\n'There's only one answer. I have to go to the Central Plains branch.'\nHe absolutely did not want to live a life where he couldn't wash properly and spent all day running around until his ass was sweaty.\n\"Eliminating those bandits who tormented the people was truly a rewarding exercise.\"\nHe said the complete opposite of what he felt, flashing that natural fake smile he'd perfected during his civil servant days.\nThe Corps Leader, completely missing Il-mok's insincerity, laughed heartily.\n\"Haha! In that case, how about joining our White Sparrow Corps after you graduate from the Demonic Way? Someone like you could easily reach Squad Leader rank within a few years.\"\nEven at this insane proposal, Il-mok kept smiling.\n\"I'd love to in spirit, but I'm afraid that would be difficult, Corps Leader.\"\nCaught off guard by the rejection, the leader stopped laughing and asked with a stern expression.\n\"Why's that?\"\n“While the mission of the combat units to stabilize our great Cult’s territory is a noble one, I have a greater purpose.”\n\"Purpose greater than military duty? What would that be?\"\n“My apologies, Corps Leader. This involves confidential matters related to my Master, so I can't easily discuss it.\"\nOf course, he didn't have any greater purpose, so Il-mok just threw the Heavenly Demon under the bus.\nHe wasn't worried about getting caught in the lie.\n'Unless this guy's completely insane, he won't go ask my Master to verify whether I'm telling the truth about failing to recruit me.'\nIl-mok casually spouted his bullshit while the White Sparrow Corps Leader stared at him intently, as if testing him.\nBut Il-mok's expression didn't change one bit under that scrutiny.\nManaging his expressions was second nature thanks to his civil servant background, and he'd gotten even better at it living in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nThe Heavenly Demon Divine Cult was a batshit crazy place full of fanatic cultists where one wrong facial expression could cost you your limbs.\nMeanwhile, Xiao Hong's face had gone completely pale as she focused all her hearing on eavesdropping on their conversation.\n'This can't be... Has the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons already given him a mission...?'\nThen, why the hell was she sent all the way to the Hall of the Demonic Way to seduce this kid?\n'Chief!!!'\nShe couldn't help but think of that old man's face, the one who'd sent her here without properly checking things first.\nGrumble.\nHer clueless stomach once again let out a loud noise.\n“Ahem. H-Here, one piece probably wasn’t enough.”\nAnd the equally clueless Chu Il-hwan started rummaging around for more snacks.\nThe White Sparrow Corps's leisurely journey continued for several days.\nAs they traveled through Xinjiang's wastelands, they occasionally encountered nomads or merchants, but didn't run into any more bandits.\nAfter spending days together, the relationship between the White Sparrow Corps members and the students had grown a bit closer, but Il-mok was the exception.\nThe Corps Leader's conversation with Il-mok had already spread among the members, so there was no point in trying to recruit him.\nHow could they prioritize themselves over the will of the Heavenly Demon, who was basically a god of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult?\nOf course, since he was the famously talked-about youngest disciple of the Heavenly Demon, some people still wanted to build connections with him regardless of recruitment.\n\"I'm sorry. I need to focus on meditation for mental cultivation.\"\nBut Il-mok always sent them away with this response after brief greetings or simple exchanges.\n\"Snore.\"\nAnd then he'd usually just take a nap.\nWhile Il-mok voluntarily lived the life of a loner, two weeks flew by.\n'Ugh. When the hell are we going back?'\nJust as Il-mok was getting sick of this boring, filthy wasteland life, he heard something that made his ears perk up.\n“Let’s spend the night at a nearby village to restock our supplies.”\nFollowing the Corps Leader's orders, they changed course and headed somewhere else.\nSoon they could see a small village in the distance, but since this was Xinjiang's wasteland — basically an empty plain — it was actually quite far away.\nAfter traveling toward the clearly visible but distant village for about two hours, they finally reached it as the sky turned the colors of sunset.\n‘Finally, I can wash properly and get a good night's sleep.’\nWith that hope in his heart, Il-mok entered the village, only to belatedly sense a strange atmosphere.\n'What's that smell...?'\nAn unpleasant mix of sweat and sour odors was wafting from all over the village.\nIt was coming from the villagers.\nWhen over sixty people suddenly swarmed into their village, the residents came out of their houses looking terrified, but then quickly started bowing when they saw the White Sparrow Corps's flag.\n\"We greet the warriors of the Divine Cult.\"\n“To what do we owe the honor of your visit to such a humble place…”\nThey all looked pretty shabby.\nIt was only after they passed through the village and arrived at the small Heavenly Demon Divine Cult branch built on one side that Il-mok understood the situation.\n“My apologies, Corps Leader. It hasn’t rained for some time, and the village well is nearly dry.”\nThe branch leader, looking apologetic, was subtly encouraging them to leave.\n\"Even the villagers are only drinking water to wet their throats, trying to conserve what's left in the well. It would be difficult to accommodate over sixty people.\"\nFrom what Il-mok had observed entering the village, it was a small place with around two hundred residents.\nIf sixty more people were added to the well that those two hundred were already struggling to share, it would inevitably run dry in an instant.\nUnderstanding the situation, the White Sparrow Corps Leader asked the branch leader with a worried expression.\n\"We can just leave and go to another village, but what about the people here? Who knows when it'll rain again?\"\n\"...Actually, we sent a letter to the main headquarters a few days ago, but I doubt they can transport water all the way here.\"\nAt the branch leader's explanation, the Corps Leader looked around at the remaining villagers with pity.\nFeeling sympathy, he gazed at the shabby villagers for a moment.\nHis slowly turning gaze stopped at one particular spot.\nNot at a villager, but at Il-mok's face.\n'Don’t fucking tell me?!'\nFeeling an inexplicable sense of dread, Il-mok tried to look away, but the Corps Leader spoke first.\n\"Disciple Il-mok.\"\n\"...Yes, Corps Leader.\"\n\"That spell you used for bathing during our camping nights. Can you still use it?\"\nHis worst fears came true. Il-mok sighed internally and answered.\n\"I can use it, but it probably won't be enough for everyone in the village to drink their fill.\"\n\"At least it's better than nothing, right?\"\nIl-mok couldn't really argue with that, so he eventually nodded.\nHe hated troublesome tasks, but what choice did he have?\n‘How can I ignore them when they're all staring at me like that?’\nHe wasn't talking about the Corps Leader's stare. It was the sight of the villagers, who still hadn't returned to their homes, looking on anxiously, worried that the newcomers might take what little water they had left. Their wretched state made it difficult to look away.\nOn top of that, there was a nagging sense of unease.\n'It's not... because of me, is it?'\nThe Dew Condensation Spell that Il-mok used every night for bathing was a spell that gathered moisture from the air to form water droplets.\nIn other words, every time he bathed using the Dew Condensation Spell, the moisture in Xinjiang's atmosphere inevitably decreased.\n'No way. Xinjiang is huge, there's no way my bathing alone could... It can't be. Definitely not.'\nConsidering the size of Xinjiang and the distance they traveled each day, it shouldn't be related to this drought.\nBut he still felt guilty about it.\n\"Where is the well?\"\nTo finally rid himself of that feeling and the pity he felt for the villagers, Il-mok headed for the well.\nThe branch leader led the way, followed by his companions.\nAnd the villagers crowded behind them, murmuring amongst themselves.\nThe air was a mix of anticipation and anxiety; the hope that these warriors might offer some help coexisted with the fear that they might take the last dregs of water from their well.\n\"Here it is.\"\nThe branch leader, having heard Il-mok's name and realizing he was the Heavenly Demon's last disciple, respectfully pointed to the well.\nIl-mok walked calmly up to the well.\n‘…There really isn’t much left.’\nThe well had been dug quite deep. But the water had almost completely dried up, making it look more like a black pit than a well.\nAfter looking down into the well, Il-mok straightened up and looked around to find over a hundred people standing in a circle, all watching him.\n\"Hoo.\"\nTaking a light breath, Il-mok closed his eyes and focused on his qi.\nThe qi of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword flowed from his dantian and merged with the atmospheric qi. From that mix of energies, he began to single out the water vapor.\nSadly, among all those countless qi in the atmosphere, moisture made up only a small portion.\nThe moisture he could sense from the drying well at the bottom of that pit actually felt more substantial.\n‘Tsk. This is like trying to squeeze water from a dry rag.’\nClicking his tongue in frustration, Il-mok formed hand seals as if he had no other choice.\nAs he formed the seals, Il-mok's energy stirred the qi flowing through the atmosphere, and through those disruptions, moisture began separating out bit by bit.\nPop!\nAs he formed another seal, the separated moisture gathered in front of his hands.\nPop!\nFinally, when Il-mok formed the last seal and pushed both hands forward.\nThe combined moisture condensed intensely, forming a small stream of water that began flowing down toward the well.\n\"!!!\"\n“Ooooh! Oh, gods!”\nSeeing this miraculous sight, some of the surrounding villagers immediately started bowing toward Il-mok.\n\"Wh-wh-who is that person to perform such magic?!\"\nOthers stood there stunned, while some turned to the branch leader with questions.\nThe branch leader answered with pride.\n\"Haven't you all heard the rumors? This is the Eighth Disciple of the Supreme One, Young Master Il-mok.\"\nAt the branch leader's introduction, all the villagers who were still standing dropped to their knees and bowed toward Il-mok.\n\"Ahhh. The Heavenly Demon has surely sent his disciple to save us!\"\n\"The Heavenly Demon Descent!! Ten Thousand Demons Obey!!\"\n\"Long live! Long live! Long live the Heavenly Demon!!\"",

    "content": "Chapter 158: Salvation (3)\nIn this cult-like atmosphere, Il-mok found himself receiving everyone's adoration in place of his Master, and he felt like he was going insane.\n‘Fuck. It's barely coming out anymore...’\nIf water had been gushing out like a waterfall, that would've been one thing. But watching this pathetic trickle that looked like someone pissing droplets made him want to crawl into a hole, especially with everyone celebrating like this.\n\"Please save us!\"\n\"May we not be blinded by evil!!\"\nThe villagers kept directing their prayers toward him, and Il-mok couldn't bring himself to stop the spell. He'd already gathered all the water qi flowing around the area, there was nothing left to work with.\n‘Just a little more. Just a bit longer...’\nHe had no choice but to force the remaining qi from his dantian to spread wider, trying to grab every water qi from even farther away. But for Il-mok, who was basically a beginner when it came to sorceries, this was ridiculously difficult.\nDrip… drip… drip…\nHe managed to barely extend his range and keep the spell going a little longer, but now there wasn't even a drop of water energy left to squeeze out of the surroundings.\nSensing the crisis, Il-mok casually glanced around.\nWhat he saw were the village residents fervently praising him, and the White Sparrow Corps members and Demonic Way Hall students watching him with smug, proud expressions, like they'd accomplished something themselves.\n‘Do something, you useless bastards!’\nIt pissed him off. Why was he the only one suffering through this?\nIt reminded him of his civil servant days during those work assignment meetings. That damn team leader would praise him for doing good work and then dump all the new department assignments on him.\nBut the most infuriating part wasn't even that asshole team leader who passed the buck.\nIt was those damn coworkers who'd cheer him on from the sidelines, never once offering to help.\nRight now, these demon cult bastards cheering him on looked exactly like those faces from back then.\n\"Haah...\"\nWith a deep sigh from Il-mok, the stream of water flowing from his hands began to weaken. The already thin trickle quickly broke off, leaving behind only a pathetic final gurgle.\n\"G-God...?\"\nThe villagers who'd been bowing reverently looked up at Il-mok with confused expressions, while the cultists stared at him with panic in their eyes.\nTheir faces all said, Why'd you stop already?.\nIl-mok turned toward them and spoke in a calm tone.\n\"This method has its limits.\"\n\"So, you're saying we should just go back? How can we leave these poor people behind?\"\nThe Corps Leader asked despite having done absolutely nothing himself. But Il-mok cut him off before he could speak again..\n\"I'm not saying we should give up. I've thought of another way.\"\nHe meant it.\n‘I won’t be the only one who's gonna bust my ass here.’\nWhile scanning the faces of those who were just watching him do all the work, a brilliant idea had come to him.\n\"If there's a well here, that means there's a water vein running through this well, right? So we just need to follow that water vein to find a spot where more water has collected, then dig there.\"\nIt was something he'd figured out while forcing himself to extend his spell’s range.\nHe couldn't sense any water qi in the air, but he could feel a dense flow connected to the well down below. Not scattered water qi, but an actual water vein that was already flowing as water.\nAdding that to his desire to put those gawking bastards to work, he had arrived at this conclusion.\n‘I'm gonna find the water vein and make these bastards dig!’\nFilled with the thought of putting the cultists to work, Il-mok strode forward with purpose.\n\"This way.\"\nFollowing the flow of the water vein he'd sensed earlier, he used his lightness skill to travel with his entourage and several warriors from the branch following behind.\nOn top of that, the villagers who'd heard the earlier conversation also started chasing after them.\nWith over two hundred people following behind Il-mok, he stopped and closed his eyes.\nHe sharpened his qi perception again and tracked the flow of water energy deep underground.\nAfter following the flow for a while, he'd move again, repeating this process.\nFollowing human water-vein-detector Il-mok's guidance, they traveled for quite some time.\nBy the time the sunset sky had turned completely black.\n\"Here!\"\nIl-mok found a spot where the water vein flow was pretty strong and pointed at the ground beneath his feet.\n\"I think it's about fifteen meters deep.\"\nIn modern times, this might have been manageable. But without an excavator, digging a 15-meter-deep hole with primitive tools or bare hands was an act of madness.\nBut Il-mok didn't care.\nAfter all, digging wasn't his job.\n\"From now on, you can use your martial arts to dig.\"\nThere were at least seventy people here who could exert superhuman strength.\nHearing Il-mok's instruction, several White Sparrow Corps members and Demonic Way’s students frowned.\n\"You want us to use our Demonic Arts to dig a pit?\"\n\"...It's not even killing evildoers, just digging dirt.\"\nBefore the White Sparrow Corps leader could scold them with a stern expression—\n\"What did you just say?\"\nIl-mok spoke first in an icy tone.\n\"Did you just say it's 'just digging a pit'?\"\n\"That's right, Disciple Il-mok. Anyone can do that kind of work, can't they?\"\nWhen one White Sparrow Corps member answered confidently, Il-mok clicked his tongue and replied.\n\"If you really think that way, then you need to go back and reread the scriptures. What's the most important doctrine of our Divine Cult? It is to watch over the evil that dwells within humans so that it does not run rampant. We punish villains to save the common people, not just because they are steeped in evil and run wild, but because through them, new evil is born.\"\nMaybe because the Heavenly Demon's disciple had brought up doctrine, everyone quietly shut their mouths and focused on his words.\n\"So what about our current situation? The well water is drying up and everyone's suffering from thirst. If more time passes and that well runs completely dry, the people living here will become evildoers capable of anything to quench their thirst. I'm not saying they are at fault. As it is written in the scriptures, there is evil within every human heart. In that case, what should we, as believers of the Divine Cult, do?\"\nThe White Sparrow Corps Leader answered that question.\n\"Before they are consumed by evil, we must solve the problem that could be the cause. In other words, we must create a new well to quench their thirst.\"\nHe'd known this fact too, which was why he'd been planning to severely punish the members and students who'd just complained.\nSince Il-mok had stepped up to scold them first, he was just watching for now.\nSeparate from answering Il-mok's question, the White Sparrow Corps leader was inwardly impressed.\n‘Even among the guys in the White Sparrow Corps, some are short-sighted, but how can someone so young have such deep thoughts...’\nRegardless of his martial achievements, he'd been feeling oddly uncomfortable seeing him always napping and obsessing over baths. But now the White Sparrow Corps Leader was finally certain. The Eighth Disciple was the 'real deal.'\nThe other cultists who heard the exchange between the White Sparrow Corps Leader and Il-mok expressed admiration or shame.\nScanning their varied faces, Il-mok thought, ‘Trying to weasel your way out of this?’\nIl-mok had never actually had any deep thoughts about this.\nHis reason for discussing doctrine wasn't anything special.\nWhen it came to putting cultists to work, there was no more convenient tool than doctrine.\n‘Doctrine can be twisted however you want anyway.’\nWith the right verbal packaging, you could create justification for anything. That was the power of cult doctrine.\nAnd his plan worked perfectly.\n\"Now that you understand how important digging a well is, get started immediately!\"\nAs soon as the White Sparrow Corps Leader's stern command fell, the cultists began digging with all their might using their martial arts.\n\"Uhahaaa!!\"\nBOOM!!\nEvery time they swung their swords, sabers, spears, or bare hands, the ground exploded and sand dust scattered everywhere.\n\"Now, now. Everyone step back.\"\nIl-mok quickly turned around and led the villagers who'd come to watch further back.\n‘Ugh. All that sand is no different from a sandstorm.’\nHe had no intention of getting covered in that crap.\nAfter moving a good distance away with the villagers, Il-mok covered his mouth and nose with a cloth and kept giving orders.\n\"There are many of you, so dig in shifts. Start with Team One, and once your internal energy is depleted, fall back to recover with meditation and then switch out.\"\n\"Keep proper spacing so you don't interfere with the person next to you.\"\nFollowing Il-mok's instructions, the human excavators soon established a system and began digging down systematically.\nThe speed was incredible.\nThe cultists attacked the ground like it was their mortal enemy, unleashing their full power and turning the earth into a wasteland.\nIf they'd been ordinary people, they would've been swept up and seriously injured, but the workers digging now weren't ordinary.\n\"Hah!\"\nWhen the ground suddenly collapsed, the cultists used their movement techniques to easily escape the flow.\n\"Hahaha! This might actually be good training for our lightness skills!\"\nAs expected of martial fanatics, they were now treating even digging a hole as a form of training.\nMeanwhile, the White Sparrow Corps Leader who was watching the labor alongside him, casually asked Il-mok a question.\n\"Won't you join them in digging, Disciple Il-mok?\"\n\"I used too much energy finding the water vein, so I need some rest.\" Il-mok lied without his expression changing one bit.\nThe White Sparrow Corps Leader, having already confirmed Il-mok's devotion, accepted his words without the slightest suspicion.\n\"That's true. Don't feel too bad about it. Just finding the water vein was a great deed for the people.\"\n\"Haha. I'm fine, Leader. I just hope the well gets finished quickly.\"\n\"Hahaha. Just trust in our corpsmen and your fellow students.\"\nThe innocent White Sparrow Corps leader, thinking Il-mok must be disappointed he couldn't help the people more, turned to look at those digging.\nBut even with human excavators, digging to a depth of fifteen meters was bound to take quite a while.\nBecause the ground was unstable, they couldn't dig straight down. They had to dig in the shape of an inverted cone, wide at the top and narrow at the bottom.\nOn top of that...\nBOOM!!\nAfter digging more than nine meters down, the sounds coming from the pit changed dramatically.\nOnce they'd cleared away all the surface sand, the real bedrock was finally starting to show itself. They were now in a situation where they had to literally carve through rock to dig deeper.\nBut the cultists didn't care.\n\"Protect your weapons with qi!\"\nThey poured out streams of demonic energy, forming Sword Qi or Saber Qi to slice through the bottom like cutting radish.\nIl-mok, who was watching the scene from afar with enhanced vision, gave additional instructions.\n\"Use the cut stones to build walls! The center has become narrow, so three of you will break through the bottom, five will clear the rocks and build the walls, and eight will carry sand to prevent the ground from collapsing! Sixteen to a team, four teams will dig in rotation!\"\nIl-mok just gave orders without lifting a finger.\nAs the pit got deeper and wider, and they had to break through stone bedrock, the cultists' internal energy drained incredibly fast.\nThe four teams rotated constantly at about thirty-minute intervals, and the cultists who emerged from the pit looked absolutely ragged.\nIt was quite a contrast to Il-mok, who stood there casually with his arms crossed, giving orders.\nAnd so more time passed. By the time the pit had become so deep that the bottom was no longer visible from the outside…\n\"Haaa!\"\nDokgo Pae was continuously swinging his greatsword in the center.\n\"Don't underestimate the Dokgo’s Nine Swords!\"\nHe was spouting nonsense like the stone chunks at the bottom were his greatest rival.\nAt first, he wondered why a warrior like himself had to do such a menial task, but his thinking changed at some point. The source of this content ɪs novel_fіre.net\n‘Stronger!’\nFor Dokgo Pae, who wielded a strength-oriented sword style focused solely on attack, this labor was actually quite helpful.\nTo cut through the stone below, he only needed to focus on power and speed. Since he was cutting through inanimate rock, he didn't need to worry about defense at all. He just had to think about how to swing harder.\nBut no matter how much he cut and smashed, the rock seemed endless.\nThe muscles he'd built up in the Bodybuilding club were trembling and screaming, and even his massive dantian that always ready to go berserk, was starting to run dry like this village's well.\nDokgo Pae didn't like this situation. It felt like he was losing to mere rock.\n\"You think this Dokgo Pae will give up!\"\nWhen his body, internal energy, and mental strength all reached their limits, the greatsword he swung toward the bottom traced a strangely different path.\n\"!?\"\nIt was a sword swung unconsciously, out of sheer frustration.\nBut Dokgo Pae, being a martial arts maniac, instinctively realized it.\n‘This… this is the true path of the Army-Piercing Hegemon Sword!’\nThe first move of the Dokgo’s Nine Swords he'd been training for nearly ten years, the Army-Piercing Hegemon Sword.\nThe true meaning of that technique was manifested in this swing.\nBOOOOM!!!\nAnd as if to prove Dokgo Pae’s intuition, a massive explosion unlike anything before echoed through the area.\nDokgo Pae, who was about to savor the enlightenment contained in that one strike, had to throw himself out of the way with a look of anguish.\nBecause through the hole he'd blasted open, highly pressurized water came gushing out.\nWHOOOOSH!\nAt that violent sound of rushing water, the villagers who'd stayed to watch despite the late hour went crazy.\n\"!! It's coming out!\"\n\"W-water!\"\nAfter shouting with moved expressions for a moment, they all began bowing in unison.\n\"Ohhh! Lord Heavenly Demon!\"\n\"The Eighth Young Master has saved us!\"\nThe one who found the water vein was Il-mok, the one who directed the construction was Il-mok, and most importantly, he was the disciple of the Heavenly Demon, the living god of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nThe villagers all praised Il-mok in unison.\nLate at night.\nHundreds of people bowed around a massive well that reflected the gentle starlight and moonlight.\nWatching this almost holy scene, Il-mok rubbed his arms.\n‘Ugh, gives me the creeps.’\nIt was a scene straight out of a cult.",

    "content": "Chapter 159: The Newcomers (1)\nShortly after the villagers, who had lost themselves in religious fervor, finally settled down…\n\"There's plenty of water, so just take one bucket each!\"\nThe cult members stepped in to mediate, distributing water from the well to the villagers.\n\"Damn it!! Daaamn iiiit~!\"\nWell, except for one deranged Dokgo Pae, who was ceaselessly swinging his greatsword at empty air like a maniac.\n\"The enlightenment of the Dokgo’s Nine Swords!!!\"\n‘Why does that lunatic keep prattling on about enlightenment? It will only worsen his side effects.’\nIl-mok watched Dokgo Pae's outburst with disdain, but then a disturbing realization hit him.\n‘...Oh. That's actually normal behavior.’\nIl-mok then frantically shook his head.\n‘Dokgo Pae, normal? No way in hell! I'm the normal one here. Obviously.’\nHe absolutely could not accept that the lunatic was normal and he was the crazy one.\nWhile Il-mok was lost in self-rationalization, the task of distributing water to the villagers was concluded.\nOnce he snapped out of it, Il-mok casually approached the branch leader.\n\"Actually, creating this well here is pretty much like drinking poison to quench thirst. The water flowing from this vein was the very water that supplied the village well, so the supply to the old well will now inevitably decrease sharply.”\n\"Ah...\"\nThe branch leader, who'd been high on the miracle of a new well appearing, finally grasped the critical point and let out a faint groan.\n\"What I'm saying is, you can't just hand out tons of water right now just because there's a lot. Everyone's caught up in the excitement today, so it would be best to explain the situation calmly after things have settled down.”\nSince this new well would dry up the old one, the villagers would have to trek all the way here to get water from now on.\nBut it wasn't entirely bad news. The old well was already running dry anyway, and this spot had way more water flowing through it.\n“It might be better in the long run to either have the branch’s martial artists transport water, or just move the whole village closer to here. That might be better all around, but you should talk it over with everyone.\"\nAfter filling the branch leader in on how to handle the aftermath, Il-mok could finally head back to the village to rest.\nAround noon the next day.\nThe cult members, who'd worked their asses off digging the well until late into the night, finally prepared to leave the village after sleeping in until the sun was high in the sky.\nA tiny village of barely two hundred people didn't exactly have lodging facilities for over sixty guests.\nHowever, the deeply moved villagers had willingly offered their own homes.\nA couple with a child would squeeze together to sleep in a corner of their tiny room to free up another, or an old couple would offer a now-empty room.\nAnd even now, as the cult members were leaving,\n\"May the Heavenly Demon descend! May the Ten Thousand Demons bring fortune!!\"\n\"We pray that the Heavenly Demon's blessing goes with the warriors of the Divine Cult!\"\nEvery single villager came out to bow and chant blessings at the departing group.\nWatching this devout spectacle, the cult members all wore satisfied expressions as they left the village, and Il-mok was no different.\nIt wasn't just because he had saved the villagers who were suffering from thirst.\n‘When was the last time I had a proper bath?’\nThanks to the fresh water from the newly dug well, Il-mok had finally been able to deal with his hygiene obsession properly.\nFor the next ten or so days, Il-mok traveled the vast wastelands of Xinjiang with the White Sparrow Corps.\nThere were days his hygiene compulsion threatened to flare up after being worn down by camping in the wild, and there were also days they stopped in a reasonably large village to rest comfortably.\nSometimes he'd witness the bizarre sight of people pulling carts with little kids in them. They were warriors from a martial unit assigned to the Elementary Demon School, which his Eldest Brother had taken charge of.\nAfter spending these unremarkable days, the time to return to the Tianshan Mountains Range had finally come.\nMaybe it was because they were getting close to home, the wasteland gave way to grasslands, and after more time passed, the outline of the Tianshan Mountain Range slowly appeared in the distance.\n\"Corps Leader.\"\nIl-mok approached the White Sparrow Corps Leader and pulled a stack of letters from his sleeve.\n\"I know this is presumptuous, but could you deliver these to my Master?\"\nUnlike the White Sparrow Corps, which was returning to headquarters after completing their mission, Il-mok had to go back to the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nAnd by tradition, students at the Hall of the Demonic Way weren't allowed any contact with headquarters. This was due to the stuffy, old-fashioned reasoning that they should focus solely on training and self-development.\nBut since this involved Il-mok's Master, the Heavenly Demon, the Corps Leader asked out of curiosity.\n\"What are these that you want me to deliver to the Supreme One?\"\n\"Letters outlining improvements I thought of while working with the White Sparrow Corps.\"\nIt was pretty uncharacteristic of Il-mok to stick his neck out and create work for himself.\nBut he had his reasons.\nIf word of what happened at that well-digging village reached his Master, he'd definitely get orders to come up with more improvement plans and whatnot.\nIl-mok had reached the conclusion that it was better to take the beating first rather than suffer his Master's nagging and trigger his obsessive compulsions. It was better to organize and present the improvement plans proactively.\nPlus, there was another reason. The rıghtful source is novel⁂fire.net\n‘I can’t be the only one to suffer.’\nThese improvement plans had a little trap hidden in them.\n\"...Improvement plans.\"\nThe Corps Leader stroked his gruff beard and muttered, accepting the stack of letters Il-mok handed him.\n“Is this something I am permitted to read?”\nThere was a hint of displeasure in his question, and Il-mok answered politely.\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nAs soon as Il-mok finished his reply, the Corps Leader dove into reading the letters.\nThe reason for his bad mood was simple.\n‘So the top-secret mission the Heavenly Demon gave the Eighth Young Master was to monitor our martial unit?’\nBecause of that word \"improvements,\" the Corps Leader figured it might be about improving how the White Sparrow Corps handled missions.\nBut not long after he started reading, he realized he'd misunderstood.\n\"Huh...\"\nAt one point while reading the letter, the Corps Leader let out a deep breath and looked at Il-mok like he was looking at some kind of monster.\n\"...I think I understand why the Supreme One gave you a different top-secret mission instead of sending you to a martial unit.”\nIl-mok gave a bitter smile at the Corps Leader's high praise.\n\"I just got lucky.\"\nHe was lucky, indeed.\n‘Damn it.’\nIt was the result of having modern knowledge combined with the obsessive-compulsive disorder from the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\nUnaware of Il-mok’s inner thoughts, the Corps Leader simply took it as modesty and smiled warmly.\n\"Normally, I'm not supposed to deliver letters from the Demonic Way students, but since this matter pertains to your role as the Eighth Young Master and not a student, I'll make sure to deliver it.\"\nThe Corps Leader carefully folded the stack of letters and tucked them into his chest like he would protect them even at the cost of his life.\nAfter more time passed and they reached the vicinity of the Tianshan Mountain Range, the White Sparrow Corps members and the Hall students exchanged light farewells and parted ways.\n\"Thank you for your teachings, seniors!\"\n\"We'll definitely become excellent cult members and meet you again!\"\n\"Haha! Let's meet again in a year!\"\nThe Corps Leader headed toward the main headquarters compound with his members, and once they arrived, he ordered them to rest.\nHe then walked straight toward the Heavenly Demon Palace.\n\"I greet the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons!\"\n\"Rise. You said Il-mok asked you to deliver letters to me?\"\n“That is correct.”\nThe Corps Leader stood up at the Heavenly Demon's command and held out the letters.\nThe Hidden Guard Pavilion Master, who served as the Heavenly Demon's personal bodyguard, accepted the letters, checked something, and then handed them to the Heavenly Demon.\nThe Heavenly Demon's eyes lit up like a martial artist who'd discovered some legendary technique as he read through the letters.\n‘Hohoho. I wonder what sort of marvelous change our youngest will bring about this time.’\nHe read with anticipation, and the more he read, the more that anticipation was fulfilled.\nThe most important task for our Divine Cult is to prevent the evil latent in all humans from running rampant. However, this land of Xinjiang is an environment all too suitable for evil to run rampant. Unlike the fertile Central Plains, more than half of this land is wasteland, and because of this, there is always a shortage of food and water.\nThe title written on the letter Il-mok had sent to the Heavenly Demon was, \"Xinjiang Wasteland Development Plan.\"\nFirst, there is a need to expand Xinjiang’s grasslands. It is impossible to turn a desert into a grassland all at once. However, if we consistently plant and cultivate new grass and trees at the border between the grasslands and the wasteland every year, it is possible to gradually expand the territory of the grasslands.\n...\nAdditionally, the children who attend schools and academies can participate in this work. Regularly watering the trees or grass they planted themselves and watching them grow will greatly help with children's emotional stability. Therefore, how about designating one day each year when all the children plant grass and trees together as 'Arbor Day' and making it a festival?\n...\nThere's a saying that mulberry fields become the blue sea. But the mulberry fields doesn’t become an ocean overnight. Expanding Xinjiang's grasslands is the same. We won't see big changes immediately, but after several decades, no one will be able to remember what old Xinjiang looked like.\nIl-mok personally called it the \"Make Our Xinjiang Green\" project.\nHis biggest inspiration came from memories of elementary school.\nMemories of planting flowers and trees with little shovels on Arbor Day.\nPlus, Arbor Day was a kind of strategic move.\nA strategy to increase holidays for the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nThe Heavenly Demon Divine Cult was a batshit crazy organization that thought working or training year-round was totally normal.\nIl-mok planned to trick the Heavenly Demon into adding more holidays, starting with this Arbor Day, so he could legally get some rest.\nAnd Il-mok's scheme didn't stop at just one holiday.\nSince even I, who have just begun to learn sorcery, was able to detect a water vein, the sorcerers of the Eight Trigrams Hall and the An Family should definitely be able to locate water veins. We must utilize them to create a map of Xinjiang’s water veins.\n...\nFor large villages near water sources like Turpan and Hami, we should expand the grasslands, while for other villages, we should create new water sources in nearby locations based on the water vein map and form new grasslands and villages centered around them.\n...\nIf we simply try to force the villagers to relocate, it could cause unrest, but new water sources will be a great temptation for them. Moreover, we have education to add to that temptation. We can utilize the warriors of the martial units and branch quarters to build new schools and academies and encourage the villagers to move.\n...\nIl-mok completed the plan by also adding a project for the villages and people currently suffering from water shortages.\nThis plan was the trap Il-mok had prepared.\nA trap filled with rage about not wanting to be buried in work alone.\nAnd the Heavenly Demon moved exactly as Il-mok intended after reading all the letters.\n\"Summon the Eight Trigrams Hall Master and the An Family Head immediately. And gather all the Corps Leaders and the Grand Teacher.\"\nThe Grand Teacher was the head of a newly created institution to handle the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's education, the Demon-Teaching Pavilion.\nIt was none other than the First Disciple, Wi Jin-hak.\nAnd from this moment on, a massive storm was about to hit the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nA terrible storm of work that would grind up all the fighters from the warriors, sorcerers from the Eight Trigrams Hall, and everyone in the Demon-Teaching Pavilion.\nMeanwhile, the one who had dropped the bomb was strolling along a mountain path with a refreshed face.\n‘Hehehe. Now they won't have time to pay attention to me.’\nFor this to stabilize, a large portion of the headquarters' personnel would have to be grounded for quite a while.\nIf things went well, they might still be busy running around even after Il-mok graduated from the Hall.\n‘If I can get assigned to a Central Plains branch during that chaos, I'll be living the good life from then on!’\nDespite being a member of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, Il-mok was indulging in a very Taoist flight of fancy.\nWhile he was imagining a peaceful future with a gleeful expression, Il-mok and the other students reached the entrance to the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nThe students, covered in dust from traveling all over Xinjiang for over a month, began passing through the main gate in their grimy robes.\nAnd in the training grounds of the Hall, to which they had returned for the first time in a month, stood unfamiliar young men and women staring at them.",

    "content": "Chapter 160: The Newcomers (2)\n“So the famous Eighth Young Master is among them, right?\"\nA classmate whispered the question while they were supposed to be training. Cheon Su-ryong, the new recruit who’d entered the Hall as the top of his class, simply nodded.\nThey were watching the upperclassmen walking past the main gate of the Hall of the Demonic Way toward the training grounds.\nIt wasn't just those two talking about it. Every newcomer in the training grounds was doing the same thing, and sensing something was up, others who'd been elsewhere started trickling out to get a look at their seniors.\nTheir goal was pretty much the same across the board.\nIt was to see with their own eyes the most talked-about figure within the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult in recent years, second only to the Heavenly Demon himself, the Eighth Young Master, Il-mok.\nThe only problem was that most of them had no clue what Il-mok actually looked like.\n\"Do you know which one of them is the Eighth Young Master?\" asked Cheon Su-ryong’s friend, a guy he’d grown up with at the main headquarters.\n\"I never went near Windrock Palace where the Eighth Young Master's quarters were supposed to be, so I've never seen him in person either.\" The source of thɪs content is novelfire(.)net\n\"Then I guess we'll have to figure it out ourselves.\"\nJust like the other newcomers, the two of them started studying their seniors' faces and trying to guess which one was the Eighth Young Master.\nAs they examined the upperclassmen's appearances, auras, and qis, both their faces gradually hardened.\n\"Every single one of them has this intense presence.\"\n\"...A year really makes that much difference, huh.\"\nMaybe it was all the dust caked on their weathered robes from traveling through Xinjiang. The seniors carried an aura that was not easily approachable.\n\"How are we supposed to figure out who the Eighth Young Master is?\"\n\"Well, at least that guy's probably not him, right?\"\nWhen Cheon Su-ryong gestured with his eyes toward someone, his friend followed his gaze to look at the man in question.\nAmong all the intimidating seniors, there was exactly one guy who stood out.\nA man who was smiling foolishly with his mouth twitching upward.\n\"There's no way the famous Eighth Young Master would be such a frivolous-looking man.”\nHis friend nodded in agreement with Cheon Su-ryong's assessment.\n\"Did he even go on the field training? He's the only one who looks clean.\"\nAmong the dusty wind-cloaks, his neat and clean attire stood out conspicuously.\n\"Did something good happen to you?\"\nIl-mok, who'd been grinning like a fool, replied in a flat tone.\n\"It's just nice being back at the Hall of the Demonic Way after a month away. Feels like coming home.\"\nIl-mok had been daydreaming about his bright future when this party crasher showed up and killed his mood.\nNoticing Il-mok's shift in attitude, Chu Il-hwan pointed toward the training grounds with a mischievous expression.\n\"Looks like the juniors are looking for you.\"\n\"Why would juniors I've never even met be looking for me?\"\n\"Well, you're pretty famous, aren't you?\"\nIl-mok let out a bitter laugh.\n'Don't they have anything better to do?'\nFor Il-mok, who dreamed of living a carefree life, other people's attention wasn't exactly welcome.\nIl-mok's indifferent attitude made Chu Il-hwan smile.\n‘Huhu. As expected, he’s quite composed.’\nMost people would be self-conscious when a bunch of eyes were focused on them.\nEven if they claimed they didn't care about others' gazes, they couldn't control their subconscious reactions.\nBut Il-mok genuinely couldn't care less.\n'Then again, he was praised so much by the villagers during this field training. It'd be stranger if he got nervous just because a few juniors were staring at him.'\nHaving organized his thoughts that far, Chu Il-hwan maintained his playful expression as he spoke.\n\"Oh, right, I forgot to tell you something before the mission. You remember that senior-junior competition from last year?”\n\"...I remember.\"\nIl-mok hesitated for a moment before answering. Not because he couldn't recall it instantly.\nBecause he suddenly had a really bad feeling about this\n‘That whole damn tournament only happened because of me…’\nA bunch of crazy seniors led by Mak Ho-yeol had swarmed him and asked him for duels. So he had done the most logical thing in that situation, he had reported them.\nFor bullying at that.\nBut this was the Hall of the Demonic Way, a place full of martial arts fanatics. Instead of punishing the seniors, the instructors had created a pointless tournament and called it a “Senior-Junior Exchange Match.”\n'No way... it can't be?'\nRemembering what happened a year ago made Il-mok anxious. And Chu Il-hwan was kind enough to turn that anxiety into reality.\n\"The Hall Master was so satisfied with last year's tournament that he's decided to hold a senior-junior exchange every year after the first field training.\"\n“…Is it the same format? One-on-one, based on rank?” Chu Il-hwan nodded.\n“Yup. And you, Disciple Il-mok, are slated to fight the top-ranked kid from the new class.”\nIl-mok let out a light sigh.\n‘What a massive pain in the ass.’\nHe couldn’t give a damn about winning or losing.\nThat evening, Chu Il-hwan officially announced the news to the rest of the students.\nIn a few days, the Senior-Junior Exchange Match would be held once more.\n\"Just like last year, anyone who catches the eye of the Hall Master and Vice Hall Master will receive special training for a month. Additionally, after the tournament ends, there'll be a brief club recruitment session.\"\nIt had been about half a year since Vice Hall Master Yu Geuk was dismissed after getting involved with Il-mok's affairs. A new Vice Hall Master had taken the position. Of course, Il-mok couldn't care less about that.\nHe barely had anything to do with the instructors, let alone the administration.\nAs soon as Chu Il-hwan left, the room buzzed with reactions.\n“Hahaha! Too bad Brother Mak left first. I hope some decent newcomers showed up!\"\nThat was Dokgo Pae.\nThe battle junkie was already fired up.\n“Ohohoho. My only worry is that the freshmen will be too distracted by my looks to focus on their practice.\"\nAnd that was Bang Mi-hwa, completely off her rocker as usual.\n\"This is my chance! A chance to catch Young Master Il-mok's attention!\"\nAnd there was Ju Seo-yeon's muttering with her head filled with nothing but thoughts of becoming Il-mok's attendant alongside Jin Hayeon.\nIl-mok himself had zero interest in the tournament, but she was practically vibrating with excitement.\nWhile his classmates each showed their own kind of excitement about the tournament in their unique ways...\n'Should I just surrender the moment the match starts?'\nIl-mok, who found everything bothersome, let out a deep sigh.\n\"Haah.\"\n\"Haah.\"\nAlmost in perfect sync, another sigh came from right beside him.\nCurious, Il-mok turned his head to see who had sighed and nodded in understanding.\n“I have to get up on that dueling stage again…”\nIt was Jeong Hyeon, her face deathly pale as she hung her head.\nSeeing her pitiful state, Il-mok called out to her in a loud voice instead of approaching.\nIf he got too close, she'd have a panic attack.\n\"Are you stressed about taking part in the competition?\"\nThe sudden loud voice made Jeong Hyeon flinch, breaking her from her solitary complaints as she raised her head.\nOnly then did she realize Il-mok was staring right at her. She answered in a flustered voice.\n\"P-people staring at me is b-burdensome.\"\n\"Hmm. But aren’t you fine during the tournament a few months ago?\"\n\"W-when I focus on the Ghostly Spirit Divine Bow, everything around me gets b-blurry, but I just find the whole situation u-uncomfortable.\"\nAfter replying, she soon dropped her head and muttered, \"I-I think I'm pathetic too, Young Master.\"\n\"???\"\nHe'd never thought of her as pathetic, but she had suddenly started digging herself into a hole.\n\"H-how can I handle proper assignments after graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way if I'm like this?\"\nShe was recalling the events of the recent practical training. How she'd panic every time the White Sparrow Corps members tried to talk to her or approach her. On top of that, Instructor Eun Ryeo's advice kept echoing in her head.\n'I-I won't make it. W-without Instructor Eun Ryeo, I can't even get along with people. S-she'll probably get tired of someone like me and leave too...'\nJust as she was about to spiral deeper, Il-mok’s voice cut through. “Then wouldn’t it be fine to do a job where you don’t have to interact with people?”\nJeong Hyeon snapped her head up to look at Il-mok.\n\"There's no need to force yourself to fit into an organization. Just find an organization that suits you.\"\nThose words coming from Il-mok's mouth sounded like a divine revelation to her.\n\"On the flip side, aren't there organizations that could make full use of your particular traits and martial arts?\"\nTo her, who was hoping for salvation, Il-mok suggested the perfect organization.\n\"For example, a place like the Dark Shadow Pavilion.\"\nIt was a strange sort of savior who recommended a career in assassination. Yet, from Il-mok’s perspective, the advice was entirely sincere.\n'It's not like organizations take care of you just because you try to fit in and show loyalty.'\nFrom Il-mok's experience living in the modern world, trying to force yourself to fit into a company that doesn't suit you only leads to mental illness.\nIn that sense, Demonic Cult members especially needed to choose careers and organizations that matched their aptitudes.\nThey were already dealing with mental issues to begin with.\nOne wrong move and they might end up with a double dose of psychological problems.\nOn top of that...\n'Just looking at Third Brother, Jeong Hyeon would probably fit right in at the Dark Shadow Pavilion.'\nSomeone who couldn't get along with people and had a gloomy personality.\nJeong Hyeon, who had no idea Il-mok was putting her in the same category as a paranoid patient.\n“D-Do you really think I can s-succeed there?”\n“With your archery and stealth skills, what better place could there be? If not that, you could also work as a Hidden Guard, protecting important people from the shadows.\"\n\"M-me? A g-guard?\"\n“A guardian who moves about openly would be uncomfortable, but wouldn’t one who operates in secret suit your disposition? Hmm, between protecting people and killing people, think about which one appeals to you more.\"\nFollowing Il-mok's advice, Jeong Hyeon used her imagination.\nShe pictured herself hiding somewhere, aiming at a target, and likewise, herself hidden somewhere else, aiming at a target.\nThe former was aiming for an assassination, while the latter was waiting to shoot anyone approaching her protection target.\nMaybe because she'd been listening to Il-mok's advice...\nWhen she tried to imagine herself protecting someone, Il-mok's face naturally came to mind as the person she'd be guarding.\nThe moment a villain dressed entirely in black approached to kill Il-mok, she would shoot an arrow to take down that assassin.\n—Thank you, Warrior Jeong! I knew I could only count on Warrior Jeong!\nA deeply moved Il-mok expresses his gratitude to her and embraces her.\nNaturally, the face of the girl with her eyes closed turned bright red, and she started squirming all over, not knowing what to do with herself.\n\"......\"\nIl-mok watched this scene with a peculiar expression.\n'...What the hell is she imagining?'\nShe's not fantasizing about killing people and getting off on it, is she?",

    "content": "Chapter 161: The Newcomers (3)\nJeong Hyeon had been writhing around dramatically, but she finally snapped back to reality. Her wriggling body suddenly froze mid-motion, and before long, she let out one of her signature weird shrieks while shrinking into herself.\n\"Hiieek!\"\nRealizing what a mess she'd made of herself, her face turned redder than humanly possible.\n‘She's gonna explode at this rate.’\nWith the feeling of facing a nearly detonated explosive with a fingernail-sized fuse before detonation, I carefully opened my mouth.\n\"Are you feeling unwell somewhere?\"\n\"N-n-no, it's n-nothing at all.\"\nShe was rambling incoherently, just moving her mouth without any real direction.\n\"I-in the future, being Young Master's bodyguard will be fun... I mean, not that kind of fun, but getting assassination missions from the Dark Shadow Pavilion is fun... well, that would be kinda weird, so... anyway, I-I don't know about future stuff, but I'm worried about the u-upcoming martial tournament.\"\nShe didn't look fine at all.\nBut poking at explosives is extremely dangerous, so I played along with what she was saying.\nDealing with citizens on the verge of a meltdown was something I was way too familiar with.\n“Hmm. If getting on the stage is burdensome, wouldn’t it be fine to just get off it?”\nSince I was planning to do exactly that anyway, it was advice I gave with genuine sincerity.\n\"Just declare surrender the moment the match starts and walk off the stage.\"\nBut for some reason, my advice made her flushed face turn ghostly pale.\n\"W-wouldn't that be too c-conspicuous? I'm n-not someone like Senior Baek Cheon, Young Master.\"\n\"......\"\nIn an instant, I had become a bastard like Baek Cheon.\nJust as Il-mok and his peers had received explanations about the exchange match, the new students also heard the news.\n\"Haaat!\"\nThanks to that, a training craze swept through the new students.\nIt wasn't about beating the seniors.\nSure, winning would be nice, but the new students had already seen the aura radiating from the seniors who'd returned from field training, and it had completely deflated their spirits.\nWhat drove them to throw themselves into training was the same reason as last year’s cohort.\nThe carrot dangled in front of them.\nWinning or losing, those who showed talent would receive special training from the Hall Master and Vice Hall Master as a reward. They are all talented enough to enroll in the Demonic Way, so that kind of reward was enough to make their eyes roll back in excitement.\nAfter several days of intensive training in preparation for the exchange match, the morning of the event finally arrived. Cheon Su-ryong headed to the training grounds where the tournament would be held alongside his friend.\nThe new students had gathered in front of Cha Eun-young, their instructor, and beside her stood a wooden board that seemed to have appeared out of nowhere.\n“Each of you, confirm your opponents for the match!”\nInstructor Cha Eun-young pointed at the board and shouted. A large sheet of paper with names written in order was attached to it.\nReading down the list of names, Cheon Su-ryong nearly clenched his fist without realizing it.\n‘Perfect!’\nHis name was written at the very bottom of the paper.\n[Cheon Su-ryong VS Il-mok]\nTogether with the name of the Eighth Young Master.\nA match against the Eighth Young Master, who at the same age of sixteen had already made his name known throughout the main headquarters. Cheon Su-ryong couldn't help but feel his competitive spirit surge.\n‘It doesn’t matter if I cannot win. Just facing him will teach me so much . ’\nHe was filled with curiosity about what kind of man the Eighth Young Master might be, and joy at the opportunity to face off against that famous figure. But then...\nInstructor Cha Eun-young's sharp voice pierced his ears.\n\"Anyone who lacks the motivation to win against their seniors will be expelled from Demonic Way! I will not stand by if anyone steps onto that stage with the weak mentality of simply learning a lesson from a senior! Do you understand!”\nOnly then did Cheon Su-ryong realize his mistake and respond with a serious tone.\n\"Yes, ma'am!!\"\nIt wasn't just Cheon Su-ryong. All the other new students had suddenly adopted grave expressions.\nThey'd already been intimidated by the seniors, but they realized they couldn't fight while accepting defeat.\n‘‘That’s right. I will win, no matter what! Without that kind of mindset, I won’t even be able to properly learn a single thing!’\nWhile all the new students were preparing for their matches with determined expressions...\n\"Did you hear that?\"\nChu Il-hwan spoke to the senior students with the swagger of a back-alley thug.\n\"If any of you idiots get careless and lose to an underclassman, I'll arrange some special training for you. Not the kind from the Hall Master or Vice Hall Master, but the kind where this Chu Il-hwan personally oversees your education.\"\nHis lips were curved upward, but black lightning energy was already rippling across both his palms.\nIt was a blatant threat that he wouldn't let anyone who lost to an underclassman off the hook.\nMaybe because of the clash of wills between the two instructors, the atmosphere of the exchange match felt more like the calm before a storm than a festival.\nIn that tense atmosphere...\n\"Begin!\"\nThe Senior-Junior Exchange Match started.\nThe event began with matches between the lowest-skilled members from both the new students and senior classes.\n\"Haaat!\"\n\"Heup!\"\nThe blood and sweat of young people giving their all in combat soaked the martial arts stage.\nSweat was one thing, but since they were fighting with real weapons, it was an insane tournament with blood flowing everywhere.\nAt least it was fortunate that nothing horrific like severed limbs or spilled guts happened.\nThat was thanks to the instructors stepping in to stop things just before accidents occurred.\nIn that thick atmosphere heavy with youthful sweat and bloodshed...\n\"Huaaaam.\"\nIl-mok was yawning his head off.\nIt wasn't just because the students' skill level was too low. Il-mok wasn't even watching the matches in the first place.\nAs he yawned widely, Il-mok belatedly came to a new realization.\n‘This exchange match event might not be so bad after all.’\nThe tournament was just two students fighting in the arena. Students whose turns hadn't come yet were just standing around watching.\nIn other words, if he limited himself to just one match, all he had to do was laze for an entire two hours and that would be it.\nWhile everyone else was watching the matches with blazing eyes, trying to gain some thread of enlightenment from observing others' fights...\n‘Enlightenment my ass.’\nIl-mok had zero interest in that kind of thing.\nThere was no reason to watch the matches, and his turn was still way off.\nFinally realizing what he had to do, Il-mok closed his eyes and focused inward.\n\"Snooore.\"\nWhich meant he'd started dozing off while standing.\nMeanwhile...\nCheon Su-ryong had been watching his fellow students' matches against seniors with burning eyes turned his head when he felt a nudge in his ribs.\n\"Hey.\"\nHis friend, who'd poked his ribs, gestured with his chin toward something, and Cheon Su-ryong turned to look.\nCheon Su-ryong's brow furrowed. He'd spotted someone sleeping while standing up.\n\"That's the senior from before, right?\"\nAt his friend's question, Cheon Su-ryong nodded with a furrowed brow.\nIt was pathetic beyond words. With countless opportunities for enlightenment spread out right in front of him, this senior was just standing there sleeping.\n\"I have no idea how someone with that kind of mindset even got admitted to the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\nAfter spitting out his harsh words, Cheon Su-ryong turned his head back toward the martial arts stage.\nHe didn't want to waste precious opportunities to observe the seniors' martial arts by paying attention to such an incompetent fool.\nBut as time passed, Cheon Su-ryong's gaze kept drifting toward that incompetent senior.\n‘...Still?’\nStrangely, that senior showed no signs of stepping onto the stage.\nEven after more than ten matches had taken place on the stage...\n‘Someone like that is in the Upper Class?’\nEven when a female senior with scattered spear techniques won her match and shouted weirdly, \"Young Master! I did it! Did you see?!\"\nEven when another female senior with a bow finished her match and immediately screamed \"Hiieek!\" in that bizarre way, that incompetent senior was still sleeping standing up.\n\"I'm going.\"\nHis friend, who'd gotten a somewhat sour expression, went up to the stage and came back thoroughly beaten.\n\"Ohohoho!!\"\nEven when a female senior with a fan burst into strange laughter while performing exaggerated martial arts movements, that senior was still sleeping standing up.\n\"Disciple Dokgo Pae and Disciple Deung Ak, step forward!\"\nAnd even when it was time for his fellow student Deung Ak—who'd been admitted as the second-ranked—that senior was still dozing.\nClang!\nClang!\n\"Uhahaha! Put a little more strength into it!\"\nEven though Senior Dokgo Pae was shouting throughout the entire match, repeatedly engaging in nothing but brute force contests in the center of the stage, creating explosive sounds one after another...\nThe match between Deung Ak, who was the second-best among his peers, and Senior Dokgo Pae, who was second among the seniors.\nEven from Cheon Su-ryong’s perspective, that fight, which repeated nothing but frontal clashes, was one from which he could learn much.\nBut Cheon Su-ryong's gaze kept wandering elsewhere.\nBy this point, even Cheon Su-ryong had to admit it.\n‘Could that incompetent-looking senior really be the Eighth Young Master?!’\nThanks to all the rumors he'd heard before entering the Hall of the Demonic Way, the Eighth Young Master in Cheon Su-ryong's imagination was literally a figure embodying the word \"perfection.\"\nAnd yet, to think that the person who had been dozing off while standing over there for two hours was the same person as that figure in his imagination.\nClang!\n\"Kuk.\"\nJust then, the match on stage came to an end.\n\"Hahaha! Excellent! You have the qualifications to join our Bodybuilding Club!\"\nAs the victorious Senior Dokgo rambled on about something, the instructor on the stage gave an order.\n\"Disciple Cheon Su-ryong and Il-mok, step forward!\"\nCheon Su-ryong, who'd been spacing out, snapped back to attention at the instructor's command and began walking.

Yes. The fact that his cloak alone was clean must also be because his skills are so superior that things like dust do not stick to his clothes!’\nThe same actions can look different depending on who's doing them.\nThat pathetic-looking behavior, when recalled again, seemed like the composure of a master.\n‘A chance to have a martial arts match with such a master.’\nHaving completed his self-hypnosis, Cheon Su-ryong raised his head with a serious expression and looked straight ahead.\n\"Um...

    "content": "Chapter 162: The Newcomers (4)\nCheon Su-ryong tried his best to keep his composure. He steadied his breathing, took his stance, and aimed his spear.\nAt that moment, the instructor's command rang out.\n\"Begin!\"\nThe Eighth Young Master hadn't bothered taking a proper stance and was still swaying around with those drowsy eyes of his.\nA strange sense of unease washed over him, but Cheon Su-ryong decided to pay it no mind.\n‘Don't let your guard down!’\nRight now, all he had to do was give it his best shot!\nSteeling his resolve, Cheon Su-ryong carefully stepped forward using his lightness skill as he approached Il-mok.\nThe moment he closed the distance to his own spear's striking range—\nSwoosh!\nCheon Su-ryong thrust his spear with the technique he'd been polishing throughout his short sixteen years of life.\nIf his father, who had taught him spearmanship, had seen this move, he would've chuckled and called it a beautifully clean strike.\nBut for some reason...\nEven as he executed what he felt was a perfect thrust, Cheon Su-ryong couldn't shake this unease.\n‘Why isn’t he moving yet?’\nLike all Demonic Arts, the move he'd unleashed was a killing blow.\nAs the spearhead flew toward his heart, the Eighth Young Master just stared at it with that bored expression.\nAnd the moment Cheon Su-ryong's spear reached Il-mok's chest—\n\"?!\"\nBefore he knew it, the Eighth Young Master's hand had grabbed his spear shaft.\nBut his surprise lasted only an instant.\nThis was exactly the situation spear fighters had to be most careful about, having their weapon grabbed.\nThanks to his strict father, he'd drilled countermeasures for this scenario into his bones.\n‘What the hell?’\nHe tried every technique he knew to push away or strike the hand gripping his spear, but...\nStep.\nStep.\nThe more he struggled, the closer the Eighth Young Master came, one step at a time, still holding his spear shaft with just one hand.\nEvery time Cheon Su-ryong tried to move his spear in desperation, the Eighth Young Master's grip moved in some mysterious way that completely neutralized his strength.\nThe gap between them continued to close as if he were sinking into a swamp, as if some special power flowed in the spear that connected them.\nBy the time Il-mok had gotten close enough to reach him, Cheon Su-ryong looked like he'd seen a ghost.\nBut the disciples of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult were made of different stuff.\n\"Hyah!\"\nEven with his face pale as a sheet, he swung his leg up to try and smash the Eighth Young Master's head.\nBut before Cheon Su-ryong's leg could even reach its full height—\n\"Urgh...\"\nCheon Su-ryong collapsed to the ground with a pain that felt like his internal organs were being torn apart.\nAs his internal energy scattered and he lay there looking up, he saw the Eighth Young Master pulling back from a palm strike.\nCheon Su-ryong realized instantly. Though he hadn’t been able to follow it with his eyes, that palm had definitely hit his abdomen.\n‘You mean he anticipated that I would swing a roundhouse kick…?’\nHe felt as if he had seen a ghost.\nNot only had he failed to even see the final move, the mysterious grappling technique from before was completely beyond his understanding.\nWhile Cheon Su-ryong was on his knees, mentally reviewing the duel with Il-mok by himself, Il-mok's flat voice broke the silence that had fallen over the area.\n\"Done. Right?\"\nOnly then did the instructor snap out of it and call an end to the match, followed by Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi's voice.\n\"Disciple Il-mok.\"\n\"Yes, Hall Master.\"\n\"Why didn't you use your sword?\"\nEveryone seemed to have the same question as they all watched Il-mok intently with their mouths shut.\nIl-mok's reason for not using his sword was the same as when he'd fought the bandits.\nTo avoid gaining enlightenment.\nNo matter how much weaker his opponent was, this damn Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword and his annoyingly talented body would always manage to find some new insight on their own.\nIt was a pain in the ass, and to avoid situations like this, Il-mok had originally planned to surrender as soon as the match began.\nThe problem was...\n‘No matter what, I can't end up being branded like Baek Cheon.’\nJeong Hyeon's subtle comment about him being of the same type as Baek Cheon had bothered him, so he'd had no choice but to actually fight.\nThank goodness.\nJust like with the bandits, this opponent wasn't even worth drawing his sword for.\nPlus, that previous incident had given him a perfect excuse.\n\"Because he wasn't worth drawing my sword for.\"\n\"!!\"\nReactions to Il-mok's arrogant answer split dramatically.\nSome frowned at his arrogance, while others nodded as if thinking, \"Well, if it's the Eighth Young Master, that makes sense.\"\nSurprisingly, Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi was in the former group.\nNodding once, Yeom Ga-hwi stroked his beard and asked, \"Then let me ask you something else. When did you train so extensively in grappling and palm techniques?\"\nThis was what Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi had really wanted to ask from the beginning.\nHis techniques were too refined for him to be called a swordsman. He was at a level surpassing even his peers who had trained in grappling as their primary martial art.\nThis definitely wasn't something you could achieve with just a day or two of training.\nBut the answer that came back was unexpected.\n\"I've never trained them separately.\"\n\"You've never trained them separately?\"\nWhen Yeom Ga-hwi kept asking, Il-mok looked confused, like he didn't understand why this was even a question.\n\"That's right. It is said that all paths lead to one, so I just applied the insights from my swordmanship through my hands.\"\nHis tone suggested this was the most obvious thing in the world.\nThis time, everyone around had the same expression.\nThey were all staring at Il-mok like he was some kind of monster.\nIn the midst of all that shock and awe, Il-mok looked uncomfortable.\nNot because he couldn't understand why they were looking at him like a freak.\nNot because having everyone stare at him made him feel like he'd become the same kind of guy as Baek Cheon.\nIt was just...\n\"...So when exactly are you planning to treat this guy?\"\nHe was worried about Cheon Su-ryong, who was still collapsed and coughing up blood.\nAbout two hours after the sparring matches ended.\n\"Ugh...\"\nCheon Su-ryong opened his eyes with a deep groan and found himself staring at an unfamiliar ceiling.\n\"You're awake?\"\nThe voice that greeted him was equally unfamiliar.\n\"This is the Hall of the Demonic Way's infirmary. You collapsed during your match with Young Master Il-mok.\"\n\"Ah...\"\nOnly then did Cheon Su-ryong remember what had happened right before he'd passed out.\n‘What a damn idiot I am...’\nHe wasn't angry at the Eighth Young Master for toying with him. Cheon Su-ryong was furious at his own incompetence for missing a chance to learn and passing out instead.\n\"Young Master Il-mok asked me to tell you he's sorry. He said he didn't mean to cause such serious internal injuries.\"\nAt Physician Seo Jae-pil's words, Cheon Su-ryong quickly snapped to attention and replied.\n\"It was a fair match. It's only my fault for being weak. How could this be the Eighth Young Master's fault?\"\nSeo Jae-pil's eyes lit up with interest at Cheon Su-ryong's response.\n\"Hmm. You're partly right about that. While treating you, I noticed that your injuries seemed less like damage from Young Master Il-mok's attack and more like symptoms of Qi Deviation.\"\n\"As I thought...\"\nAt the sound of Cheon Su-ryong’s quiet muttering, Seo Jae-pil’s eyes gleamed.\n\"From your reaction, it seems you were already aware of this.\"\n\"I had some idea.\"\n\"Could you tell me more about it?\"\nPhysician Seo Jae-pil had somehow already grabbed a thin brush and paper.\nCheon Su-ryong didn't seem to care about what Seo Jae-pil was doing. He stared into space with a complicated expression and began to speak.\n\"Actually, ever since the match ended, I've been obsessing over the same thing.\"\n“Could you tell me what that thought was?”\n\"I kept replaying the techniques the Eighth Young Master used in our match. I was trying to analyze the fight. But... no matter how much I went over it, I just couldn't understand it. Those mysterious techniques of his. Then at some point, my mind suddenly started getting cloudy.\"\n\"So you're saying you fell into a Heart Demon while trying to understand Young Master Il-mok's techniques?\"\n\"...Yes.\"\nCheon Su-ryong spoke with a bitter expression.\n\"It was the moment I truly realized what an incompetent fool I am. I heard the Eighth Young Master was a swordsman, but I couldn't understand even his grappling techniques, let alone his swordsmanship.\"\nInstead of offering empty consolation, Seo Jae-pil nodded with a listening attitude.\nIt was a counseling approach he'd developed from treating countless patients, starting from his time as a physician at the Pure Mind Hall.\nAnd being a skilled mad scientist, despite his attentive exterior, he was thinking something else entirely.\n‘Fortunately, he seems not to have heard what Young Master Il-mok said.’\nCheon Su-ryong had been brought to the infirmary right after the matches ended. Seo Jae-pil had questioned Il-mok and others about what had happened during the match for accurate treatment and diagnosis.\nThat's how Seo Jae-pil knew about Il-mok's arrogant comment.\n—Because he wasn't worth drawing my sword for.\nIf this young man, who was already this depressed from failing to understand just one of Young Master Il-mok's grappling techniques, had also heard that comment, he probably would've bled from all seven orifices and died on the spot instead of just coughing up blood from Qi Deviation.\n‘He must have already fallen into the Heart Demon before that comment, or he was too focused on analyzing the match to hear it.’\nLike the skilled physician he was, Seo Jae-pil was careful not to write down his thoughts on paper.\nIt would be troublesome if he were writing in front of the patient and the patient happened to see it.\nHe just filed it away in his mind to record it later after this young patient had left.\nWhile thinking this, Seo Jae-pil skillfully changed the subject.\nIf he let the patient keep digging himself into a hole, he might fall into another Heart Demon.\nSeo Jae-pil poured some pre-prepared hot water into a teacup and offered it to Cheon Su-ryong.\n\"It's tea that helps calm the mind, but it's still hot, so drink carefully.\"\nCheon Su-ryong took the cup and sipped it slowly.\nWhile Cheon Su-ryong was momentarily distracted from his gloomy thoughts by focusing on carefully drinking the hot tea, Physician Seo Jae-pil spoke calmly.\n\"Don't worry too much about the Qi Deviation. While you did fall into a HeartDdemon from analyzing the match, you were injured at the time. You might have been more susceptible to the Heart Demon because of your internal injuries, don't you think?\"\nHe said this in a matter-of-fact tone.\nPeople with strong pride don't welcome pity from others. Sometimes a 'physician's diagnosis' was more comforting than words of consolation.\n\"...I suppose that's one way to look at it.\"\nSeeing that his patient had somewhat accepted his words, Seo Jae-pil continued.\n\"Likewise, you might have had trouble understanding Young Master Il-mok's martial arts because your head was dizzy from the internal injuries. There will be plenty of opportunities anyway, so couldn't you observe Young Master Il-mok's martial arts again later?\"\n\"Would someone like me, who practices different techniques and different classes, really have another chance to observe the Eighth Young Master's martial arts?\"\n\"Haha. You might not receive the same training because you're in a different year, but there are ways to spend time together. What about clubs?\"\n\"Ah!!\"\nWhen Cheon Su-ryong exclaimed with hopeful eyes, Seo Jae-pil smiled and said, \"The club Young Master Il-mok joined is called the Meditation Club.\"\nCheon Su-ryong kept muttering \"Meditation Club, Meditation Club\" like those characters were a lifeline.\nAfter watching this for a moment, Seo Jae-pil figured the patient's condition had improved enough and got to the main point.\nThe reason Seo Jae-pil had boldly sold out Young Master Il-mok.

Could you tell me about the Demonic Art you practice and its side effects?\"\nIt was time to expand his research subjects.",

    "content": "Chapter 163: The Newcomers (5)\nIn the afternoon, after the exchange matches had ended.\n\"Huaaah.\"\nIl-mok, who had already dozed off for two hours during the tournament, yawned lazily as he headed to the club room.\nSince he'd been sleeping while standing anyway, Il-mok didn't count those hours as actual rest.\n‘If I get a solid hour of sleep during club time, I'll feel perfectly refreshed.’\nBut when he opened the club room door in high spirits, Il-mok's face immediately scrunched up.\n‘...Why are there so many people?’\nThe club room was swarming with people like bugs.\nThe space that used to be occupied by just five people was now packed with over ten people.\nAnd when Il-mok appeared, the swarm of bugs filling the room suddenly went into a frenzy.\n\"We greet the Eighth Young Master!\"\n\"Eighth Young Master! We watched your sparring match earlier today!\"\nThey were all new recruits.\nHaving witnessed Il-mok's ridiculous skills at the tournament, they'd tracked down his club and joined while hoping to build connections with him.\n‘Fuck. Did they not even shower after the matches?’\nThe thick smell of sweat wafting from the new recruits who'd suddenly latched onto him made Il-mok's vision go dark.\nThe one who saved him from this predicament was Chu Il-hwan.\n\"Anyone not back in their seat before I count to three gets roasted alive.\"\nThough his playful smile made it sound like a joke, the black lightning crackling in his hands guaranteed he was dead serious.\nUnable to withstand the threat, the new recruits returned to their seats. Chu Il-hwan grinned and continued his threat.\n\"I'm starting to suspect some idiots joined without even knowing what this club is called.\"\nHe was telling them to meditate quietly, as befitting the name \"Meditation Club.\"\nUnwilling to be treated as idiots, or perhaps unwilling to be burned to death by Chu Il-hwan’s black lightning, the new cadets avoided his gaze and subtly turned their heads away.\nPhew.\nFinally free from the new recruits' body odor, Il-mok let out a light sigh and scanned the club room.\nSince there are so many people here compared to the available space, Il-mok was forced to a situation where he had no choice but to sit right next to someone.\nIl-mok found a spot next to the cleanest-looking recruit he could find.\n\"It's an honor to see you again, Eighth Young Master.\"\nAs soon as he sat down, the neatly dressed new recruit beside him offered a greeting.\nIt was Cheon Su-ryong, the one who had coughed up blood and passed out during the match.\nHe’d left the infirmary and immediately changed out of his bloody clothes. He even washed up before coming straight to the club room.\nOnly after receiving the greeting did Il-mok realize this was the new recruit he'd sparred with earlier, and asked after his condition.\n\"Ah... Are you feeling alright?\"\n“Thanks to the physician in the infirmary, I believe I have recovered well.”\n\"I-I see.\" Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs novel⸺fire.net\nIl-mok answered halfheartedly.\nSo Seo Jae-pil might talk like a quack, but he's actually a decent physician.\nAfter finishing his greeting, Cheon Su-ryong's face turned red as he spoke up.\n“I-If it is possible, would you grant me another match with you next time?”\nHe was embarrassed to be requesting a match when his skills were so far below Il-mok's level.\nIt was purely his desire to grow stronger that made him swallow his pride and make such a request.\nAt Cheon Su-ryong's request, Il-mok felt goosebumps run up his arm.\n‘You've gotta be kidding me. Is this another guy who likes getting hit?’\nIl-mok couldn't comprehend the mental state of this junior who was blushing while asking to get beaten up again.\nAs Il-mok was contemplating what to do with this crazy bastard, Chu Il-hwan's stern command fell once more.\n\"You two over there. Looks like you want to get roasted.\"\nAt Chu Il-hwan's threat, Cheon Su-ryong answered with a face full of reluctance.\n\"My apologies, Instructor.\"\nEven after that, Cheon Su-ryong kept glancing at Il-mok beside him with a puppy-eyed look.\n‘His stare is going to burn a hole right through me at this rate.’\nIl-mok considered giving him the same physical \"education\" he'd given Choi Woong's trio.\n‘...But if he's a masochist, that would backfire, wouldn't it?’\nRealizing this was a bad move, Il-mok let out a light sigh.\n‘Right. Since he’s a guy who likes getting hit, not hitting him is its own kind of revenge. Heh.’\nIf Cheon Su-ryong, who was dreaming of sparring with Il-mok, had known this conclusion, he would have wept tears of blood.\nAs life at the Hall of the Demonic Way passed the one-year mark and juniors started arriving, various changes came to Il-mok and his peers' daily routines.\nFor Il-mok, who suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder, this was an unwelcome situation.\nFor someone with OCD, change meant triggering severe Qi Deviation.\nGoing out for field training was one such thing, and being swarmed by the newcomers at club time was another. On top of that, a change occurred in the content of their classes.\n\"In a year, you will all become talents who will lead the Cult while serving in its various organizations. Furthermore, as you must go on four more field training, you are scheduled to learn things that will be of more help in actual combat.”\nRight after Instructor Eun Ryeo finished her lengthy explanation in her usual cold tone, an assistant brought in some pills and distributed small pieces to each recruit.\n‘What is this? An elixir? But will it still work if broken up like this?’\nIl-mok's question was soon answered.\n\"Those pills we distributed are poison pills obtained from the medical wing of the headquarters. From now on, you will learn how to deal with poison.\"\nLearning that what he'd thought was medicine was actually poison, Il-mok set down the piece of poison pill he'd been holding.\nHe had an uneasy feeling it might be absorbed through his skin.\nMeanwhile, Instructor Eun Ryeo continued her explanation.\n\"There are various poisons in the world, and we cannot have you experience and practice countermeasures for every single one. So you will experience the energy and symptoms of representative poisons and learn universal countermeasures. After listening to my full explanation, each of you will ingest the poison pill you were given, feel how the poison spreads and what symptoms it causes, then proceed with detoxification. Understood?\"\n\"Yes, Instructor!\"\nWhile everyone answered energetically, only Il-mok kept his mouth shut, glaring at the poison pill.\n‘Now, of all things, I have to voluntarily eat poison.’\nFor Il-mok, who suffered from hygiene-related OCD, this was too big a change.\nWas it because of all the recent changes? Il-mok lifted his head and stared into space.\n‘I really want to convert to another religion.’\nEven after years, he felt like he'd never adapt to this damned Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nWhile Il-mok was having his moment of existential crisis, Instructor Eun Ryeo's voice echoed through the room.\n\"The poison pill we've given you this time is a Paralysis Pill. If you eat an entire pill, your whole body will be paralyzed and you could die from respiratory failure.\"\nHearing that the very first practice involved potentially lethal poison, Il-mok squeezed his eyes shut.\n‘Instructor, you're going way too fast with the curriculum.’\nAs if hearing Il-mok's inner thoughts, Instructor Eun Ryeo added more explanation.\n\"But don't worry. The amount we've given you will at most cause some tingling in your limbs. Even if you have a sensitive constitution to poison, it won't be enough to kill you, so you can be at ease.”\nAt this truly reassuring news, Il-mok almost let out a sigh without realizing it.\n\"You will now ingest this poison pill and observe how the poison's energy spreads after going down your throat, and how it tries to destroy your body. Then, after I give the signal, each of you must circulate your internal energy to push that energy out of your body.\"\nAfter saying so, Eun Ryeo suddenly shoved an entire poison pill into her mouth, chewed it a few times, then swallowed it.\nA moment later, black droplets began dripping from her right index finger.\n“I have condensed the poison energy into one spot and expelled it. However, this feat is only possible if you can accurately sense the poison energy and wrap it with your internal energy before it spreads. Your priority is to observe the poison spreading, so rather than trying to gather what's already spread, you should expel it through multiple points like this.\"\nAs she spoke, black droplets were also dripping from Instructor Eun Ryeo's left ring finger.\nAnd as if that was enough of an explanation, Instructor Eun Ryeo called out coldly.\n\"Now, everyone ingest the poison!\"\nAs soon as her command fell, the nine recruits of The Upper Class immediately tossed the poison pieces into their mouths without hesitation.\nWatching this bold scene, Il-mok muttered a curse under his breath.\n\"Fuck.\"\nAfter mumbling in Korean so others couldn't understand, Il-mok let out a deep sigh and swallowed the poison pill.\nAfter confirming everyone had swallowed their pills, Eun Ryeo shouted.\n\"Focus on how the poison spreads! To expel the poison later, you must be able to accurately distinguish the poison energy!\"\nEven as the disciples were gradually being poisoned by the Paralysis Pills, Eun Ryeo continued her advice.\n\"When pushing out the poison energy, you must always wrap it with your internal energy before expelling it. If you push it out without wrapping it, the meridians or organs that touch the poison could be damaged, so be careful.\"\nAfter continuing with other important advice, Eun Ryeo checked the hourglass and shouted.\n\"Begin detoxification now!\"\nSimultaneously, all the recruits began circulating their internal energy, and Il-mok was no different.\nDespite his limbs tingling, Il-mok moved boldly.\n‘I've already located all the poison energy anyway.’\nIt was thanks to his excellent qi perception, which even An Jeok-un, the direct descendant of the An family and Master of the Eight Trigrams Hall's Wind Thunder Chamber, had called a prodigy.\nThe internal energy in his dantian rushed out at once, racing through the wide meridians cleaned by the Bone Washing and Marrow Cleansing.\nBy the time the vast internal energy had circulated once through his entire body according to the principles of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, all the poison energy that had spread throughout had been enveloped by that internal energy. And the place where that massive internal energy headed last was none other than Il-mok’s right index finger.\nDrip.\nDrip.\nThe quiet sound of black droplets flowing down Il-mok's right index finger broke the silence.\nWhen Il-mok opened his eyes after expelling all the poison at once, the other disciples were still engaged in a bloody battle with the poison energy with their eyes closed.\nInstructor Eun Ryeo, confirming that Il-mok had expelled the poison first, spoke up.\n\"Excellent.\"\nThough she didn't like his casual attitude toward women, she was someone who clearly distinguished between public and private matters.\n\"But be careful in real combat situations. If you try to gather paralysis poison toward your right hand that holds the sword and make even a tiny mistake, your right arm could go numb and put you in danger.\"\n\"Then would it be safer to send it to the left hand?\"\n\"If we're only talking about arms, yes.\"\n\"???\"\n\"If you lose control of the poison energy gathered near your heart while trying to expel it through your left hand, you could have a heart attack, so be careful of that.\"\n\"......\"\nIl-mok looked at his right hand with a complicated expression. Specifically, at the poison that had flowed below his index finger.\nSince he practiced the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword with his right hand, he had habitually expelled the poison through his right hand following the sword art's principles.\nWhat if he'd tried to push it to the left? What if he'd made a mistake in the process?\n‘…That means I could have fucking died, doesn’t it?’\nAs expected, the Demonic Cult’s educational methods were insane.\nIl-mok felt disillusioned by the Demonic Cult's educational methods and was suffering from the urge to convert, but there was a slight misunderstanding here.\nInstructor Eun Ryeo had mentioned heart attacks only as a precaution for future real combat situations.\nIn the first place, the Paralysis Pill was a weak poison that could barely kill one person even if the entire pill was used.\nThere was almost no chance of getting a heart attack from the poison in a small piece of Paralysis Pill unless you were incredibly unlucky.\nOf course, decades ago at the Hall of the Demonic Way, they used to use whole Paralysis Pills for training.\nThis too was a result of the current Heavenly Demon, whose mercy reached the heavens, drastically lowering the difficulty of the curriculum to save at least some of the Hall's talents who were dying pointlessly.\nIf Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi had heard Il-mok's complaints, he probably would have reminisced about the old days with full boomer energy.",

After a few days, I was swallowing half a pill whole.\nWhile some initiates struggled with the increased concentration of toxins, I always expelled the poison in no time.\nIn a way, you could chalk it up to the wonders of obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n'That shit was inside my body?'\nThe thought alone made me sick, so I'd pour every ounce of energy into purging it from my system.\nAnyway, after several days of paralysis poison training, we moved on to sampling new toxins.\n\"Qi Dispersing Poison becomes nearly impossible to counter with your own internal energy once it spreads through your body. However, it's not immediately life-threatening, so first you'll experience its effects firsthand, then learn to suppress it before it can spread.\"\nWhile training with the Qi Dispersing Poison, a thought also occurred to me. If the demonic energy of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword disappeared, wouldn't the side effects also disappear?\nThe answer? Complete opposite.\nLike withdrawal symptoms, the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword started acting up when I couldn't handle demonic energy anymore.\nWe also sampled minute amounts of serious poisons that could dissolve organs, skin, and bones. We even tried aphrodisiacs.\nThe group aphrodisiac session was particularly bizarre, though nothing actually happened.\n\"Hehehe... ugh...\"\nThe moment someone showed signs of succumbing to the effects, Instructor Eun Ryeo would knock them out cold.\nWe experienced all sorts of poisons beyond that.\nNot just ingested ones, but those absorbed through skin or breathing.\nIn an environment that felt as if we had become subjects in a mad scientist’s biological experiment, I started to understand how 'poison' worked in this world.\n'Basically, anything harmful to the body counts as poison.'\nThey just called it all \"poison,\" but each type contained completely different energies.\nThat's why Instructor Eun Ryeo first had us experience direct poisoning.\nVarious energies entered and left our bodies through food and tea. It was even the same with respiration. The key was to sense and expel only the harmful energies from among the countless energies that would enter and exit the body throughout one’s life.\n'On the flip side, if you don't recognize something as poison, you could be slowly exposed without even knowing. '\nLike Third Brother's Black Bean Tea, or the sulfur and mercury that those of Eight Trigrams Hall loved to handle.\nUnless it obviously wrecked your body quickly, it'd be hard to recognize as poison if it worked subtly over years or affected your mind instead of causing direct illness.\nWhile Il-mok was spending his days fighting a bloody battle with poisons, a subtle change was occurring in the Meditation Club.\nThe number of disciples in the club was slowly decreasing each day.\nThe reason the new cadets had flocked to the Meditation Club was entirely because of Il-mok.\n'I'll get close to the Eighth Young Master through the club!'\n'I wonder what the famous Eighth Young Master is like in the club?’\n'There must be a reason he joined the Meditation Club. Maybe he's seeking enlightenment through meditation.'\nThe fantasies of those who had joined the club with such thoughts were shattered in their entirety within a few days.\n\" Snooooore. \"\nThanks to Il-mok's habit of sitting cross-legged and falling into deep sleep the moment club time started.\nAt first, everyone was in denial.\n'S-snoring?'\n'I must have heard wrong...'\nThen came the self-delusion.\n'R-right, Father said it's important to rest well when not in combat during missions.'\n‘He is not sleeping! He is so deep in meditation that it only looks like he’s sleeping. He's seeking enlightenment!'\nBut self-delusion only lasts so long.\nOne by one, they began accepting the truth.\nThe genius Il-mok might actually be an incredibly lazy bastard.\nAnd around that time, fellow disciples from other clubs started tempting them away.\n\"Bwahaha! You should join the Bodybuilding Club! External training is crucial for martial arts! As warriors of the Divine Cult, shouldn't we cultivate our bodies too?\"\nDeung Ak, who'd caught Dokgo Pae's eye and joined the Bodybuilding Club, preached the importance of muscles.\n\"As followers of the Divine Cult, nothing is more important than doctrine.\"\nIt goes without saying that the Doctrine Research Club was popular.\n“To think that I can portray the great achievements of the Heavenly Demon through my own acting. What a truly wonderful thing!”\nSurprisingly, a few new students showed interest in the Theater Club.\nOf course, thanks to the new students joining, there was now one senior female student who felt her breath catch in her throat every time she went to that clearing.\nAnd so, around twenty days had passed. Only five students now remained in the Meditation Club.\nBefore Il-mok and Instructor Chu Il-hwan arrived, Choi Woong and his buddies casually asked Cheon Su-ryong, the only junior still remaining.\n\"Don't you want to transfer to another club, junior?\"\n\"We hate to say this, but we're stuck here against our will.\"\n\"It’s because of Young Master Il-mok.\"\nThe three of them couldn’t bring themselves to say that the moment they quit, they would receive an ‘education’ from Il-mok. It was too embarrassing a story to tell a junior.\nCheon Su-ryong nodded at their words.\n\"I'm also staying because of Young Master Il-mok.\"\nWhile all of his peers had realized the truth about Il-mok and left, he said, \"I will definitely spar with Young Master Il-mok again. That's why I'm staying in this club.\"\nCheon Su-ryong's faith remained unshaken after having his skull cracked and patched up over the \"Truth about the Eighth Young Master.\"\nThis was because the divine grappling techniques he had displayed that day still flickered in his mind.\nHow could a master who could perform such grappling techniques truly be lazy?\nMoreover, the Eighth Young Master was supposedly a swordsman. Considering a sword specialist displayed such hand techniques, it made even less sense.\nThat was the conclusion the brain-patched Cheon Su-ryong came to.\nHe had reached a state where he could not see the truth even when it was right before his eyes, and simply accepted what he wanted to believe. As is common for those who believe in a false truth, Cheon Su-ryong spoke with his eyes glittering brightly.\n'...He wants to spar with Young Master Il-mok again?'\n'After what happened at the tournament?'\nThe trio looked at Cheon Su-ryong like he was insane.\nTo the west beyond the Tianshan Mountains. On the grasslands of a region known in the Central Plains as the Outer Lands. In a place where people who appeared to be nomads had formed a settlement, a certain man dismounted his horse with urgent movements and entered the largest tent.\n\"Khan!\"\nThe chieftain, Mukhtar Khan, who'd been praying to his one true god, calmly finished his devotions and rose despite his subordinate's urgency.\nThe man, realizing he'd interrupted the Khan's important time, fell to his knees with an ashen face.\n\"Rise.\"\n“I-I have committed a crime worthy of death.”\n\"Enough. If you've truly come with important matters, won't God forgive you?\"\nAt Mukhtar Khan's words, the man gulped.\nInterpreting the Khan's words backwards meant he'd die if the information wasn't important.\nBut though nervous, the man was confident.\nHe was certain both the Khan and their God would forgive him for information of this caliber.\n\"There have been changes among the infidels entrenched in Tianshan to the southeast.\"\n\"Changes?\"\n\"Their patrols around Tianshan have decreased significantly, and instead, it is said that the majority of the infidels are now moving throughout the Xinjiang region.”\n\"...Their guard has weakened. Did you discover why?\"\n\"Yes, Khan! I heard it's because of the Heavenly Demon's last disciple, the one those infidels worship as a god!\"\nMukhtar Khan paused briefly at the name Heavenly Demon, then calmly asked as if nothing had happened.\n\"The Heavenly Demon's last disciple? What has he done?\"\n\"The infidels are pouring all their efforts into handling something that the last disciple proposed.\"\n“Hmm. It seems that this last disciple is quite an outstanding fellow.”\nAt Mukhtar Khan's words, mockery crossed his subordinate's lips.\n\"It's because they're foolish infidels. I heard he's just a whelp who hasn't even graduated from their training institution yet.\"\n“You mean that place with the strange name, the Hall of the Demonic Way?”\n\"Yes. I have heard that the reason for the recent change in their movements is because that last disciple preached what he had realized during his first practical training.”\n\"First field training...\"\nMukhtar Khan made a curious expression as he recalled what he knew about the infidels.\n\"Then this last disciple will go on several more field training?\"\n\"Yes, Khan.\"\n\"Hmm... If the entire heretic group moved on a young disciple's single suggestion, the Heavenly Demon must cherish this last disciple greatly.\"\n“What is there to say? To be played by a greenhorn who is not even twenty years old, the infidels are truly foolish beyond measure.”\nUnfazed by his subordinate’s mockery of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult and the Heavenly Demon, Mukhtar Khan stroked his beard as he organized his thoughts.\nNo matter how much he mulled it over, he reached the conclusion that there could be no better opportunity than this.\n\"Tell the warriors to prepare for a Holy War.\"\nThough Mukhtar Khan called it a Holy War, he had no intention of fighting the entire Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nAbout thirty years ago, when he was just a whelp barely recognized as a warrior, he had witnessed with his own eyes the might of the being those infidels worshipped as god.\nThe might of the Heavenly Demon.\nIt was a truly surreal sight\nNot just because his father and brothers were torn apart like mosquitoes with each casual gesture from the Heavenly Demon.\nIt felt like witnessing a god, not a human, wielding power forbidden to mortals.\nThat day, God's rest came to Mukhtar Khan's clan who had hidden in the Tianshan Mountains for pillaging. For origınal chapters go to N0v3l.Fiɾe.net\nThe impartial rest called death.\nAmong those massacred that day, only a handful survived and escaped.\nMukhtar Khan barely survived, but that day's events remained etched in his mind.\nA god, yes, but one who led everyone to death.\nThe existence of that Evil God gnawed at his spirit as if he were cursed.\nMukhtar Khan, who was wasting away day by day because of that curse, had a very special experience one day. He came into contact with the doctrines of a Western religion that had begun to spread in the region where he lived several decades ago.\nOriginally, Mukhtar Khan had believed in the Tngri like other nomads. But after encountering their teachings, he escaped the memory of the Evil God.\nHe was freed from the curse.\nFrom that day, Mukhtar Khan was reborn. He was reborn as a warrior who served a god greater than the Evil God.\nAs a warrior of the one true god, Mukhtar Khan continued his holy war at the forefront of spreading God's word.\nAnd now, after several decades have passed, he had become the Khan of a tribe no less large than the one his father had led in the past.\n'This too is God's will.'\nGod must have given him this opportunity. An opportunity for revenge.\nOf course, they were merely God's warriors, not God Himself. They couldn't dare oppose the Evil God directly.\nSo his target wasn't the Heavenly Demon.\n“Let’s see if tears of blood flow from the Evil God’s eyes as well.”\nJust as he himself had shed tears of blood while fleeing to survive as his parents and brothers were annihilated that day, he would make tears of blood flow from the Evil God’s eyes by killing his most cherished youngest disciple, just as he had lost his family.\nHe didn't care how many tribal warriors died in the process.\nThis was a Holy War.\nA god who shed tears of blood was no god, so this was a Holy War to prove that only his God was the one true God in this world.",

    "content": "Chapter 165: God is Great (2)\nWhile I was adapting to the changed life in the Hall of the Demonic Way, time flew by quickly. During lesson hours, the instructors and teaching assistants would give the students various pieces of advice regarding the last practical training, and the cadets would devote themselves to training based on that.\nOn top of that, Instructor Eun Ryeo's poison resistance training was gradually ramping up in difficulty.\n\"Urgh...\"\nEvery now and then, someone would show symptoms of poisoning, but thanks to the quick response from Instructor Eun Ryeo and the assistants, nobody ended up seriously ill enough to be carried off to headquarters.\nThe Meditation Club had also become much more comfortable thanks to the drastic reduction in people.\n‘Why the hell is this guy still here?’\nThe only thing that bothered me was that the one called Cheon Su-ryong remained until the end and kept staring at me creepily.\nAfter more than a month had passed like this, we once again left the Hall and headed out somewhere. Time for our second field training.\nBut this time, we were heading in a completely different direction from the last exercise.\nInstead of leaving the Tianshan Mountain Range toward Xinjiang, we were heading toward the main headquarters. Official source ıs n0velfire.net\nAnd when we arrived at a location about midway between the Hall and the main headquarters, we came face to face with a group that was waiting for us.\nAt the front stood a middle-aged man with a scary-looking scar right under his eye. He smiled and spoke up.\n\"Welcome, disciples of the Hall of the Demonic Way. I'm Ouyang Hyeok, leader of the Black Tiger Corps.\"\nIt was a strange feeling.\nWithout that scar, he might've looked like a jolly middle-aged uncle, but that mark under his eye gave off an inexplicable sense of pressure.\n\"We greet the Black Tiger Corps Leader!\"\nThe moment he finished his introduction, all the disciples clasped their hands in salute.\nThe Black Tiger Corps Leader maintained that peculiar smile as he swept his gaze over the saluting disciples.\nHmm?\nThe exact moment his eyes landed on me—\nHis lips curled up even wider, and as soon as our eyes met, his expression quickly returned to normal before he looked away.\n‘Does he know me?’\nWhile I was puzzling over this, the Black Tiger Corps Leader, having finished surveying all the disciples, began to speak.\n\"The Black Tiger Corps's mission is to watch over our sacred Tianshan Mountain Range. As unbelievers also live to the west and north beyond the mountains, our mission is to prevent them from daring to covet this place.”\nMaybe because he was explaining what we'd be doing, the students’ eyes gleamed as they focused on his words.\n\"In the past, six units would take turns patrolling different sectors. But now, since the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons has turned his attention more toward internal affairs, only three units including ours take turns patrolling and monitoring the mountains. So you lot better focus even harder on this training. Just because we have fewer people doesn't mean we can afford gaps in our surveillance.\"\nListening to the Black Tiger Corps Leader's explanation, I was starting to understand why he'd smiled at me earlier.\n‘Shit. I'm screwed.’\nIt had to be a grudge against me.\nThe reason the units monitoring the Tianshan Mountains Range had been reduced from six to three, and the reason my master had placed more importance on internal affairs, was all because of my advice.\nBecause manpower was short due to matters like the children’s education and the Xinjiang redevelopment plan, we had to divert even the military units to those tasks.\nWhile I was feeling a sense of foreboding that this practical training period would be colored by darkness, the Black Tiger Corps Leader suddenly said something unexpected.\n\"Yes, go ahead and ask.\"\nTurning my head in confusion, I saw Dokgo Pae with his hand raised high, his eyes twinkling with anticipation.\n\"So does this mean we'll get to fight any unbeliever bastards who sneak into the Tianshan Mountains Range?\"\n\"If unbelievers enter the mountains, you'll fight them.\"\n\"And if none come in, won't we go out hunting for them?\"\nDokgo Pae was practically dying to bash in some unbeliever skulls.\n“As I said before, we are short on manpower as we are focusing on internal affairs right now. Rather than catching and killing the unbelievers to the west, you should focus only on finding those who have infiltrated.”\nAt that answer, Dokgo Pae openly showed his disappointment and muttered, \"Please invade, you unbeliever bastards! This Dokgo Pae will split your heads open with my Nine Swords!\"\nThe guy was insane.\nAfter that, the Black Tiger Corps Leader continued explaining the unit's duties and things to watch out for.\n\"Any additional questions, you can ask the senior unit members during rest breaks on patrol.\"\nWith his brief explanation finished and his order to move out, they began traveling through the mountain paths of the Tianshan Mountains Range.\nUnlike the last training, this time we moved at a fairly leisurely pace.\nBack then, we'd needed to deal with bandits as quickly as possible. Now, our purpose was surveillance and reconnaissance.\nThey executed their lightness skills at a speed that was not fast, but spread out at a certain interval to watch their surroundings as they moved.\nHowever, just because the speed was slow did not mean it was comfortable. It wasn't a full-out sprint, but they had to maintain a certain pace while constantly watching in all directions and move for nearly two hours without rest.\n\"We'll take a short break here.\"\nAt the Black Tiger Corps Leader's command, those who'd been scattered at intervals began gathering together.\n‘Phew.’\nIl-mok stopped at a reasonable distance and let out a light sigh.\n‘This feels a bit unpleasant.’\nUnlike the other students who were drenched in sweat, Il-mok, with his superior cultivation, felt more like he'd taken a light stroll.\nThere was just a thin sheen of sweat on his forehead, and his body wasn't soaked. But even this much made Il-mok feel uncomfortable in various ways.\n‘Should I take a bath? Or not?’\nWhile he was debating whether to use his Dew Condensation spell.\nHis expression turned ashen.\nThis was because the Black Tiger Corps Leader had, at some point, approached his side.\n\"Hahaha, no need to be so tense. I'm not going to eat you.\"\nIl-mok forced a smile.\n‘He won't eat me, sure...’\nInstead, he'd probably grill me like a nightmare customer.\nBut what came out of the Black Tiger Corps Leader's mouth was completely different from Il-mok's expectations.\n\"Actually, I've heard about you from our Mun.\"\n\"...?\"\nAfter briefly wondering who Mun was, Il-mok finally figured it out.\n\"Do you mean Young Warrior Ouyang Mun?\"\n\"That's right. Hahaha. You probably guessed from my surname, but Mun is my nephew.\"\n\"Ah...\"\nHe hadn't expected this at all, hadn't even considered it.\n\"Hahaha. You seem surprised that I recognized you at our first meeting. Actually, I asked Mun to describe your appearance, that’s why I could recognize you immediately.\"\n\"I-is that so?\"\nWhy on earth had he asked his nephew about my appearance?\n‘He’s really dead set on screwing me over.’\nIl-mok kept being reminded of nightmare customers from his modern life, but again, what came from the Black Tiger Corps Leader's mouth was unexpected.\n\"I've actually heard quite a bit about you through rumors. Well, I'd been hearing about you from Mun even before the rumors started spreading. I hear Mun considers you as his teacher?\"\n“Ahahaha… You praise me too highly.”\n“Hahaha. If the stories I’ve heard from the White Sparrow Corps Leader and Mun are anything to go by, the rumors don't do you justice.\"\nIt seemed that Ouyang Mun wasn't enough, and he had sought information even from the White Sparrow Corps with whom I had worked during the last practical training.\nAnd Black Tiger Corps Leader Ouyang Hyeok, still maintaining his characteristic smile, said casually, \"I heard from the White Sparrow Corps Leader that after graduating from the Hall, you'll be taking on a special mission assigned by the Heavenly Demon?\"\nIl-mok almost grimaced.\n‘Why is that guy such a blabbermouth?’\nSince the words had already been spoken, he couldn’t reveal them as a lie here. Il-mok struggled to manage his expression and replied.\n\"...That's correct.\"\n\"Hmm. But if you wanted, couldn't you convince the Supreme One otherwise? How about it? After graduating from the Hall, why not join our Black Tiger Corps?\"\nOnly then did Il-mok realize Ouyang Hyeok's purpose.\nSo he wasn't a nightmare customer; he was here to recruit.\nThat made things simple.\nAll tension vanished from Il-mok as he smiled softly.\n\"I'm sorry. I share the same intentions as my Master.\"\nAs long as he wasn't a nightmare customer, there was no reason to fear him.\nThe journey with the Black Tiger Corps wasn't too bad from Il-mok's perspective.\nThere was no rushing around like with the White Sparrow Corps, and most importantly, getting water was easy.\nHe could get water from mountain streams and creeks, and since there was generally more moisture in the air compared to the wasteland, using the Dew Condensation spell was easier too.\n“Dammit! You cowardly unbeliever bastards! Why don’t you invade!”\nThe crazy Dokgo Pae's nonsense occasionally reached his ears, but Il-mok paid it little mind.\nAnd so, about two weeks of wandering the Tianshan Mountains Range with the Black Tiger Corps, the Black Tiger Corps Leader called a halt at a spot by a river.\n\"Stop! We'll rest here for four hours.\"\nAt his shout, the demonic cultists gathered around the Black Tiger Corps Leader and began preparing to rest.\nSome approached the river to fetch or drink water, while others plopped down to regulate their breathing or chat with their neighbors.\nIn this atmosphere, Il-mok suddenly used his lightness skill to break away from the group and head somewhere.\nBut everyone just shrugged it off. They'd seen this scene multiple times over the past two weeks.\n“Is he going to bathe again?”\n“My, my… he’s amazing in many ways.”\nThe Black Tiger Corps members' expressions as they said this looked remarkably similar to how they'd looked at Dokgo Pae when he was spouting nonsense.\nUnaware that others viewed him on the same level as Dokgo Pae, Il-mok quickly moved through the bushes, stripped off his clothes, and dove into the river.\nSplash!\nWith a refreshing sound, Il-mok washed the sweat from his body in the river water. He was about to rub himself with the soap he'd brought when he froze.\nThere was something off about the river water that had gotten into his mouth when he dove in.\nFrowning, he spent a moment discerning the energy he felt from the water. Then, Il-mok spat out the river water that had entered his mouth.\n‘Who would've thought the detoxification training would help like this.’\nThe energy he'd felt in the river water was a type of Qi Dissipating Poison.\n\"Poison!! There's poison in the river water!\"\nThe moment Il-mok shouted this, the Black Tiger Corps Leader roared, \"Anyone who drank the river water, use your internal energy to expel the poison immediately! Everyone else, form battle formations!\"\nAs soon as he heard Il-mok's shout, the Black Tiger Corps Leader realized something crucial.\nThe area was too quiet.\nOf course, with over sixty people including the Black Tiger Corps and Demonic Way’s students moving together, it was natural for animals to avoid them.\nBut this was a riverside location. It would be one thing near them, but it was strange not to hear any animal sounds from upstream or downstream either.\nWhile those who'd drunk water regulated their breathing and others stood guard in combat readiness, Il-mok also hurriedly dried himself off and threw on his clothes before returning.\n‘Damn it. Damn it.’\nHe hadn't even dried off properly, and putting sweaty clothes back on made him feel like he was going crazy.\n\"Finally! Finally!!\"\nMeanwhile, seeing Dokgo Pae rejoicing at the arrival of combat made Il-mok want to smack him upside the head.\n\"Shut up!!\"\n\"Our comrades could die!\"\n\"Do you think real combat is a game?!\"\nAt least the Black Tiger Corps members knew when to be serious; they started scolding Dokgo Pae, whom they'd normally just laugh off.\n\"Phew.\"\nWatching Dokgo Pae get chewed out made Il-mok feel a bit better as he sighed.\nThrough the bushes, figures slowly approaching began to appear.\nThey were spread out wide, occupying all sides, and their numbers easily looked to be over a hundred.\nEnhancing his vision with internal energy to observe them, Il-mok soon tilted his head in confusion.\n‘Their clothing is like that of nomads, but their ethnicities are mixed?’\nPerhaps because they'd come from beyond the Tianshan Mountains Range, about half looked like nomads or Mongols, while the other half looked like people from what's commonly called the Middle East.\nWhen they'd closed to a certain distance—\nThe qi flow in the atmosphere began to twist around several men.\nIl-mok quickly grasped the situation.\n‘Sorcery?’\nThough not identical, it gave off a similar vibe to when Instructor An Jeok-un had demonstrated sorcery.\nThey were waving sticks in their hands, muttering in an incomprehensible language.\nFollowing the movements of their waving sticks, the flow of qi mixed chaotically before suddenly stabilizing.\n\"Allahu Akbar (God is Great)!!\"\nAnd Allah's magic wands breathed fire.\n(TL Note: Korean’s nickname for RPG-7. Well, there are obviously no rocket launchers in this series, but we got wizard, tho)",

    "content": "Chapter 166: God is Great (3)\n'Ah, Allah?'\nThanks to the enemies' shouts, Il-mok realized what religion these guys believed in and wore a weird expression.\nIn that moment, flames came flying at them from all four directions.\n\"Haaah!\"\nBlack Tiger Corps Leader Ouyang Hyeok roared as he swung his swift blade through the air in rapid succession.\nFollowing the path of his blade, a blade wind imbued with demonic energy flew to meet the flames of Allah.\nLed by Ouyang Hyeok's blade winds, the Vice Leader, several members, as well as Chu Il-hwan and the other instructors of the Hall of the Demonic Way, brandished their own weapons.\nIn the end, the flames of Allah were ultimately blocked by the gale they created, but the problem was that this place was a mountain.\nThe flames began spreading to the surrounding vegetation around the river.\n\"Allahu Akbar!!\"\nOnce again, the fanatics let out that familiar battle cry that Il-mok knew all too well as they charged straight at them.\nIl-mok felt like everything was going dark before his eyes.\nHe had lived his life cursing the followers of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult as fanatics, but he had never imagined he would come face-to-face with real fanatics, the kind he'd only seen on the news back in the modern world.\nJust then, the Black Tiger Corps Leader's shout snapped Il-mok back to reality.\n\"Followers of the great Heavenly Demon Divine Cult never abandon their comrades! Hold out until those poisoned wake up!\"\nThe reason they'd been waiting around while Allah's sorcerers conjured up flames was simple, those who'd been poisoned hadn't finished purging the toxins yet.\nWhether it was thanks to Ouyang Hyeok's rallying cry, or just because they were crazy bastards who loved fighting to begin with...\n\"Come on then!\"\n\"We'll send you straight to King Yama!!\"\nThe demonic cult members maintained their formation while roaring with high morale.\nIn the center, those who'd drunk the river water and gotten poisoned were using their internal energy to expel the toxins, while the unaffected ones formed a protective circle around them to block the enemies.\nSince Il-mok hadn't been poisoned, he had no choice but to face the enemies on the front lines.\nThe enemies charged at them, each wielding weapons while spouting some incomprehensible language he'd never heard before.\nBut their eyes were familiar.\nIl-mok had seen those same eyes countless times in those who blindly believed in something.\n\"Fuck this shit.\"\nIl-mok spat out a curse as he drew his sword.\nThe number of enemies was far too great.\nThis was not a situation where he could leisurely face them with fist or grappling techniques as he had with the demonic bandits.\nSchlick!\nUnpleasant severing sound echoed across the battlefield.\nBlack Tiger Corps Leader Ouyang Hyeok swung his blade at lightning speed, and the Saber Qi that burst from his weapon cut through space, flying forward to sever the neck of a fanatic charging at the front.\nThud.\nWhether because it hadn’t registered its own death or due to inertia, the corpse ran a few more steps forward before collapsing with a wet thump.\nThe blood flowing from that severed neck began soaking the ground as if foreshadowing the events that were to unfold.\nCrunch.\nAnd that same corpse, the one that had died leading the charge, was trampled and crushed under its comrades’ feet.\n\"As Allah wills (حسب مشيئة الله).”\n\"Death to the enemy (الموت للعدو)!”\nThe fanatics paid no heed to their comrade’s death; no, their eyes burned even brighter as they charged forward.\nBut they'd picked the wrong enemies.\n\"The Heavenly Demon Descends!!\"\n\"Ten Thousand Demons Obey!!!\"\nEven faced with the fanatics' intimidating presence, the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult warriors didn't back down.\nThe fanatics charging from all directions finally clashed with the cult members who'd formed their battle formation.\nSchlick!!\nClang!!\nThe sounds of metal clashing and slicing rang out from everywhere.\n\"Allahu Akbar!!\"\n\"Heavenly Demon! Grant me strength!!\"\nCries calling upon their gods.\n\"Aaaahhh!!\"\n\"Die!!\"\nScreams and furious shouts mixed together.\nIt was a bizarre spectacle.\nEveryone there was calling upon their god, yet instead of being holy, the scene was filled with nothing but malice and killing intent.\nAnd Il-mok, standing right in the middle of that contradictory place, couldn't escape from that malice either.\n\"Death (موت)!”\nA middle-aged man with bloodshot eyes roared incomprehensibly as he swung a curved blade at him. On top of that, another man beside him was thrusting a spear to cover any gaps.\nFaced with that blatant and cloying killing intent, Il-mok gritted his teeth.\n—Kill!\n—Human flesh and bone as the canvas, and blood as the ink!\n—Draw the most beautiful sword path!!\nThe side effects screamed in his head. He wanted to ignore those voices, but Il-mok wasn't stupid.\nStanding there like an idiot would get him killed.\n\"Shut the hell up, you perverted bastard!!\"\nCursing at the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's ego, Il-mok swung his sword.\nHis sword moved gracefully, deflecting the curved blade.\nClang!\nClang!!\nThe curved blade, struck by his sword imbued with internal energy, was pushed back and collided with the spear wielded by another fanatic. The source of this content ɪs novel·fiɾe·net\nAs the two weapons collided and both fanatics hesitated for a moment—\nSwish!\nA beautiful silver trajectory traced the optimal path through the air.\nTwo headless corpses collapsed to the ground.\nIn that space full of contradictions, Il-mok also gave in to contradiction.\nHe cursed the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's ego while having no choice but to act exactly as it wanted.\nHis first kill.\nBut whether it was because of the Demonic Art's influence or the urgent situation, he didn't feel overwhelming guilt like he'd become some kind of monster.\nJust an inexplicable uneasiness that soured his mood.\nMaybe it was because he'd seen both corpses' faces the moment he cut their necks.\nThe faces of those two headless bodies weren't angry or sad.\nThey were smiling.\nMaybe that smile was the reason he didn't feel guilt, and why that inexplicable uneasiness crawled up his spine like bugs.\n\"Fuck.\"\nWhile spitting out curses to shake off the unpleasant feeling, another enemy charged at Il-mok.\nCrunch!\nHe trampled over the body of the comrade whose head Il-mok had just severed.\n\"Crazy bastards.\"\nAfter Il-mok muttered the curse and deflected that curved blade, he realized too late that he'd been wrong.\nJust trampling comrades' corpses wasn't nearly enough to call them crazy; their madness was far more vicious than that.\nSwoosh!!\nFrom the enemy’s rear, arrows and nets flew through the air—\nRight into the middle of the battlefield where enemies and allies were mixed up in chaotic combat.\nThunk!\n\"Cough...\"\nMost of them didn't hit the cult members, but the backs of their own allies.\nBut some flew over their comrades to target the cult members.\nScreams and groans erupted everywhere as people got hit by arrows.\n\"Damn it!\"\nSomeone else got caught in a net and thrashed around, spitting curses.\n\"Allahu Akbar!!\"\nWith that battle cry that now made him want to curse just from hearing it, the sorcerers fire again.\nRight into that battlefield where allies and enemies were all mixed together.\n\"......\"\nNow he was so speechless he couldn't even curse.\nIl-mok stared with a stunned expression at the enemies burning to death.\nNot because of their attitude of not giving a damn about their comrades' deaths.\nIt’s because the smiles plastered on their face even as they became human pincushions for their own allies' arrows and burned alive.\nIt hadn't even been a quarter of an hour since the battle started, but Il-mok already felt like he was going to be sick.\nIl-mok had misunderstood them.\nThey weren't indifferent to death. Rather, they celebrated their comrades' deaths and eagerly wished for their own.\nThey'd already heard the explanation from Mukhtar Khan.\nThis battle was a Holy War.\nTheir sacred scriptures stated, ‘O you who have believed, fight those adjacent to you of the disbelievers and let them see that you are stern. Know that Allah is with the righteous.'\nThus, when they engaged in a holy war against the infidels, God was always with them.\nIf they died in Holy War alongside their God and for their God's sake, wouldn't they be granted paradise afterward?\nAlso, according to their scripture, that paradise had all kinds of trees and fruits, special wine, and most importantly—they could have seventy-two virgins as wives.\nDeath in Holy War wasn't something to fear.\nRather, it was the fastest shortcut to paradise.\n\"Allahu Akbar!!\"\nThe result of fanatics who wanted to hurry off to paradise mixing with fanatics who believed their dead comrades would go to paradise was devastating.\nMangled corpses were scattered everywhere, and the blood they'd created stained the vegetation red.\nThe flames created by the sorcerers burned the mountain, while the signal flares lit by the Black Tiger Corps Leader added green smoke to the mix.\nBut the fanatics' coordinated assault didn't end with just sending allies to paradise.\n\"Goddamn it!!\"\nThe insane wave attacks that didn't distinguish between friend and foe caused casualties among the cult members too.\nMost of them were Black Tiger Corps members.\nBut it wasn't because they were incompetent.\nThe majority were injured while trying to protect the Hall of the Demonic Way disciples, who were unaccustomed not just to chaotic melees but to real combat itself, and were losing their minds in the face of the fanatics’ crazed assault.\n\"S-sorry, senior...\"\n\"Save the apologies and swing your sword more!!\"\nWhile the Black Tiger Corps members and instructors were bickering—\n\"Death (موت)!”\nThe fanatics started going even wilder, delighted that the enemies had casualties.\nBut the cult members didn't just collapse.\n\"Sorry we're late!!\"\n“The injured, fall back!!”\nThose who'd purged all the poison with their internal energy got up one by one and joined the battle.\nOuyang Hyeok's eyes blazed as he coolly assessed the battlefield amidst the chaos.\n\"Haaah!\"\nWhen Ouyang Hyeok unleashed the lethal technique he'd been saving with a battle cry, dark trajectories were embroidered across the air in succession.\nSchlick!\nSchlick!\nA path made of human flesh, muscle, bone, and blood opened up.\n\"Hall of the Demonic Way instructors, lead the students and get out of here. Now!!\"\nOuyang Hyeok, who'd expended his internal energy to clear the path, held his ground alone to prevent the fanatics from closing that path again while giving orders.\nAs soon as his order fell, the instructors and teaching assistants helped him widen the path, and Chu Il-hwan shouted additional instructions.\n\"Disciples, follow us!!\"\nIn the midst of all that, one student let out an insane shout.\n\"Fleeing is unworthy of a Heavenly Demon Divine Cult warrior!!\"\nIt was Dokgo Pae.\nWhile everyone else was too busy fighting enemies to pay attention, Il-mok screamed furiously on their behalf.\n\"The seniors can't fight properly because of us, you stupid bastard!!!\"\n\"!!!\"\nThe idea that he was being a hindrance rather than helpful, as the eldest son of the Dokgo family, was so unimaginable that Dokgo Pae's face went pale from shock.\nBut Il-mok didn't have time to care about Dokgo Pae's feelings.\nClang!\nAfter blocking a charging fanatic's spear, Il-mok used the recoil to deploy his lightness skill and approach Dokgo Pae.\nThen he grabbed Dokgo Pae by the scruff of his neck and launched himself forward.\n\"If running away now feels humiliating, then go back alive and build up your skills! Right now, surviving comes first!\"\nShouting that, Il-mok ran toward the path of life that Ouyang Hyeok and the instructors had created.\n\"Damn it...\"\nFinally coming to his senses, Dokgo Pae knocked away Il-mok's hand that had been gripping his neck and deployed his lightness skill with gritted teeth.\nRight after those two were the last students to escape through the path of life, Ouyang Hyeok sent a telepathic message to the Vice Leader.\n—Take the injured members and get out of here. We'll buy a little more time before following.\n—Understood.\nThe Vice Leader followed Ouyang Hyeok's orders without the slightest question.\nIt was too risky to send only the disciples, instructors, and teaching assistants from the Hall of the Demonic Way. They didn't know the geography of the Tianshan Mountain Range accurately.\nThe Vice Leader and injured members needed to act as guides to lead them to safety.\nAlso—\n'Once the disciples and the injured escape, Corps Leader won't have any other burden.'\nThe Vice Leader trusted in Ouyang Hyeok and the Black Tiger Corps members' skills.\n\" As Allah wills (حسب مشيئة الله).”\n\"Death to the enemy (الموت للعدو)!”\nWhile Ouyang Hyeok and the Black Tiger Corps members broke through and bought time, the Vice Leader and the injured members also escaped through the path of life and joined up with the Hall of the Demonic Way people.\n\"Allahu Akbar!!\"\n\"Die!!\"\nIgnoring the fanatics' shouts and Black Tiger Corps members' battle cries from behind, they ran at full speed with their lightness skills.\nHow long had they been fleeing?\nWhen the shouts, the sounds of slicing, and the clang of metal could no longer be heard…\n\"Son of a bitch...\"\n\"Tch.\"\nThe Black Tiger Corps Vice Leader quietly spat a curse, and Head Instructor Chu Il-hwan clicked his tongue with an expression full of irritation.\nAnd Il-mok would soon understand why they'd reacted that way.\nFrom beyond the bushes, more fanatics were approaching from all directions.",

    "content": "Chapter 167: God is Great (4)\n“So it was a trap,” muttered the Black Tiger Vice Leader as he scanned the fanatics who were once again advancing on them from all sides.\nThat's when Il-mok was finally able to roughly grasp the situation.\n‘Those aren't the same bastards who attacked us earlier.’\nNot a single one of them had blood on them. Hell, if they'd been chasing from behind, there's no way they could've surrounded us like this.\nThey'd herded us into running in one direction, then waited here for us.\nOnce Il-mok figured that much out, a new question naturally popped into his head.\n‘But who the hell were they setting this trap for?’\nIf they were just targeting some random Demonic Cult combat unit, there'd be no point in setting up an elaborate trap like this.\nThe fact that they went to the trouble of herding us onto an escape route and setting a trap must mean they had a specific target they expected to come this way.\nEven with the Demonic Cult's surveillance network getting weaker lately, who could possibly be worth bringing hundreds of people into Demonic Cult territory to hunt down?\nThe question didn't take long to answer.\nFrom among the enemies approaching on all sides, someone pointed directly at Il-mok and said something to a middle-aged man who looked like their leader.\n\"We must kill him (علينا قتله).”\n“Why is it me again?”\nThis was getting old.\nAnd it wasn't just because of these damn fanatics swarming him nonstop.\nEver since his master had kidnapped him, he couldn't figure out why so many people kept targeting him.\n‘Fucking Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.’\nHe swallowed the curse he couldn't voice out loud.\n\"Allahu Akbar!!\"\nWith that battle cry that made him want to puke just hearing it, waves of energy began to stir once more.\nThe sorcerers began casting their spells, shouting yet another unintelligible cry as they charged.\n\"For the Holy War (الحروب المقدسه)!”\nEven as flames shot out from behind, aiming for their back, their eyes didn't hold even a trace of fear.\nJust madness masquerading as faith.\n“Snap out of it!”\n\"Form up! We need to break through no matter what!\"\nTo prevent their own side from being swallowed by the enemy’s madness, Chu Il-hwan and the Black Tiger Vice Leader roared with voices laced with internal energy.\n\"Follow me!!\"\n\"Instructors and assistant instructors, protect the disciples and follow!\"\nAfter giving their orders, the Vice Leader and Chu Il-hwan boldly charged straight ahead.\nThey started cutting through, slicing off the heads of fanatics who were practically begging to die and burning bodies with black lightning.\nBut the situation wasn't looking good.\nExcept for the Vice Leader, all eight Black Tiger Corps members were wounded from the previous battle, and most of the Hall of the Demonic Way disciples barely had any real combat experience.\nEven among those you could call experts, only the Vice Leader and the Demonic Way’s instructors could fight at full strength.\nAt least the Vice Leader and Chu Il-hwan were raising hell at the front and opening a path, but maybe their intent was too obvious.\n\"Over there (هناك)!”\nThe fanatic bastards started converging toward the direction where the Vice Leader and Chu Il-hwan were breaking through.\nAs the path narrowed and the fanatics' coordinated attacks got more vicious, someone's shout erupted from among the panicking Disciples experiencing their first chaotic battle.\n\"We need support on the northwest side!\"\nThe one who shouted was Gwak Sul.\nFor some reason, in this horrific situation he'd never experienced before, he could see the path.\nAnd as it happened, there was one other disciple present who saw the very same path.\nSwoosh!\nThe moment Gwak Sul shouted, Il-mok's sword sliced through the fanatics' vital points as he launched himself northwest with his lightness skill.\nIt was a strange feeling.\nThe moment he realized that the monster he'd never considered a fellow disciple could see the same path as him, an inexplicable confidence washed over him.\nAnd as Il-mok cut through the fanatics and carved out a path, he shouted back at Gwak Sul.\n\"Keep giving orders!\"\nGwak Sul hesitated for a moment.\n‘M-Me? Take command in a situation like this?’\nBut at Il-mok's follow-up shout, his eyes quickly found their focus.\n\"Follow Disciple Gwak Sul's orders!\"\nRight in the middle of a battlefield echoing with screams and clashing metal, he ironically felt calmer.\nIn this crisis where they faced annihilation, the strategist who'd broken out of his shell started running his mouth nonstop.\nHis orders weren't just about simple commands or merely pointing out directions.\n\"Disciple Dokgo Pae! Don't hesitate! Break through! Show them the power of the Dokgo’s Nine Swords! Black Tiger Corps seniors, support Disciple Dokgo Pae as he charges!\"\n\"Disciple Jeong Hyeon! Intercept their commanders and spell-casters! Those of you near Disciple Jeong Hyeon, your top priority is to protect her!”\nRecalling the positions of his allies, the formation of his enemies, and the unique characteristics of each friendly warrior’s martial arts, he shouted out a constant stream of the most necessary commands for every single moment.\nDokgo Pae's head kept replaying what Il-mok had said to him earlier.\n\"The seniors can't fight properly because of us, you stupid bastard!!!\"\nHe was furious.\nNot at Il-mok.\nHe was furious at his own incompetence, and having to run away in the real combat situation he'd been dying for.\nYeah, if he was going to die on the battlefield because of his own weakness, he was ready to accept that.\nBut...\n‘Me... Dokgo Pae, the eldest son of the Dokgo family, is nothing more than a hindrance to our own forces?’\nA descendant of a great warrior. A being that stood at the forefront to pierce through the enemy’s frontline. That was what life should be for a man with the surname Dokgo.\nYes, just like the Black Tiger Corps's Vice Leader and Instructor Chu Il-hwan who is cutting through up ahead right now.\nBut he couldn't get there.\n‘Right now, I cannot break through like those two.’\nBecause he was incompetent.\nSo Dokgo Pae just swung his greatsword out of habit.\nRunning down the path carved out ahead, just blocking the heretics coming at him.\nWithout even realizing it, a Heart Demon began creeping into his mind.\n\"Disciple Dokgo Pae! Don't hesitate! Break through! Show them the power of the Dokgo’s Nine Swords! Black Tiger Corps seniors, support Disciple Dokgo Pae as he charges!\"\nThen, a voice that was all too familiar to him cut through the haze.\nGwak Sul.\nThat scrawny guy who was way too weak for a Demonic Way disciple. The classmate he had taken under his wing simply because he had a decent head on his shoulders.\nAnd lately, the strategist who always gave him directions during tests.\nEven while drowning in his own sense of powerlessness, he moved according to a habit that had been drilled into him over the past few months.\n\"Haaa!\"\nFollowing Gwak Sul's orders, he started charging forward with the full power of the Dokgo Nine Swords.\nImmense power gathered in his greatsword.\nCrack!\nThe fanatic’s body was torn apart in a way that couldn’t be described as a clean cut, but rather as a messy, crushing blow.\n‘This isn't right!’\nDokgo Pae gritted his teeth.\nThe first form of the Dokgo Nine Swords he'd gained insight into last time, the Army-Piercing Hegemon Sword, wasn't such a pathetic technique.\nDokgo Pae recalled that day's memory and raised his great \\sword again.\nThe technique was now so completely ingrained in his body that even without conscious thought, his internal energy flowed naturally through its pathways.\nWhen that flow reached its peak, the force-laden sword traced the most optimal path as it swung.\nSlice!!\nIt completely bisected both the fanatic’s curved blade and body that blocked his way.\n\"I am the eldest son of the Dokgo Family, the great Dokgo Pae!\"\nFree from his Heart Demon, Dokgo Pae roared in frustration as he pressed forward.\nThat's right.\nThe Dokgo Nine Swords wasn't about holding position or protecting someone.\nIt was an art meant only for advancing.\nThe Dokgo Nine Swords only ended when there were no more enemies to pierce through or when he died.\n\"Die!!!\"\nFrom some point on, Dokgo Pae was focused on one thing and one thing only.\nTo swing his sword.\nThoughts about his incompetence, anger, shame—all of that was meaningless.\nThe only thing that mattered was breaking through.\n‘Stronger! Faster!’\nAnd the only meaningful thought was figuring out how to swing his sword stronger and faster to break through.\nMeanwhile...\n\"Huh.\"\nAs Dokgo Pae started charging straight ahead, the expressions of the four Black Tiger Corps members around him changed.\n“As expected of the Dokgo Family.”\n\"What incredible talent.\"\nIn this brutal melee, Dokgo Pae's sword was getting steadily stronger with each swing.\nThe Black Tiger Corps members exchanged glances, nodded, and launched themselves forward to support Dokgo Pae as he charged ahead alone.\nThey'd decided to follow the orders of Gwak Sul, who was just a student.\nIt wasn't just because of Il-mok's orders.\nUnder normal circumstances, perhaps it would have been different. But since they had been injured in the last battle while protecting the students, they realized it was more efficient to let Dokgo Pae take the front line.\nJeong Hyeon felt like she was about to have a breakdown.\nOver a hundred enemies swarmed from every direction.\nAll of them screaming incomprehensible battle cries with eyes full of madness.\nWorse, because the enemy charged without any regard for their own lives, the Demonic Cult’s formation was being forced to become tighter and tighter.\nWith people constantly entering her personal space, the side effects of the Ghost Spirit Divine Bow were threatening to consume her.\nShe'd barely managed to escape when Black Tiger Corps Leader Ouyang Hyeok broke through and opened a path.\n\"Allahu Akbar!!\"\nBut then more fanatics surrounded them again, shouting their incomprehensible battle cry.\nAlready pushed to her limit, her face had turned completely pale.\nWith her bow-holding arm already hanging limp and her face half-dazed, Gwak Sul's orders didn't even register in her ears.\nJust as her consciousness began to fade and the world started to blur…\n\"Disciple Jeong Hyeon!\"\nSomeone's shout right in front of her jolted her fading consciousness back.\n\"Eek!\"\nJeong Hyeon, who'd regained even a bit of awareness, screamed. She was someone who got startled when people approached within three feet, but somehow, Instructor Eun Ryeo had gotten right up to her face and was calling her name. Updates are released by Novᴇl_Fire(.)net\nBut the shock was fleeting.\n“Snap out of it!!”\nAt Eun Ryeo's desperate cry, Jeong Hyeon felt confused.\nShe'd relied on Instructor Eun Ryeo for over a year, but she'd never seen this expression before. The always-calm Instructor Eun Ryeo now had a complex face mixing pity and desperation.\n\"Listen carefully! The people around you are not here to hurt you! They are here to protect you! Trust them! You must not be afraid, do you hear me?!”\nStill not fully free from the Ghost Spirit Divine Bow's influence, Jeong Hyeon couldn't properly process Eun Ryeo's words.\nIt felt like having her head underwater, hearing sounds from above the surface.\nSeeing Jeong Hyeon still looking dazed, Eun Ryeo gritted her teeth.\n‘This won't work.’\nThe most efficient method would be to abandon Jeong Hyeon. Even at this moment, being tied down to Jeong Hyeon was causing losses to their fighting strength.\nBut Eun Ryeo couldn't bring herself to do it.\nMaybe it was because of the Demonic Art's side effects, but as an instructor, she couldn't abandon her student.\nThat said, she couldn't stay tied down here forever either.\n‘I need to find a way! I need to get Disciple Jeong Hyeon out of her Heart Demon as fast as possible!’\nMaybe because it was a battlefield where lives hung in the balance, various memories flashed through Instructor Eun Ryeo's mind like a slideshow.\n\"!!!\"\nShe suddenly remembered something Physician Seo Jae-pil had told her before.\n—Come to think of it, among the methods for treating side effects, pushing the mind to its extreme limits can be quite effective too. Young Master Il-mok called it shock therapy.\nTime was running out. Without even hesitating, Eun Ryeo reached out and grabbed Jeong Hyeon's face.\nThen she forcibly turned the flinching Jeong Hyeon's head to look in a certain direction.\n\"If you keep spacing out like this, Disciple Il-mok might die!\"\nAs Eun Ryeo's hands turned her head, the sight of Il-mok locked in bloody combat with the fanatics burned into Jeong Hyeon's pupils.\nWatching Jeong Hyeon's pupils dilate instantly, Eun Ryeo bit her lip.\n‘Please.’\nEun Ryeo didn't like Il-mok. She thought he was playing with Disciple Jeong Hyeon's feelings.\nBut in Eun Ryeo's opinion, Il-mok was the person Jeong Hyeon treasured most within the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nShe gambled that maybe, to save someone like that, Jeong Hyeon would snap out of it.\nAnd at some point, relief and worry mixed in Eun Ryeo's eyes.\nThe dazed Jeong Hyeon was slowly raising her bow.\nIt wasn’t that she had broken free from her Heart Demon. Rather, due to the side effects of the Ghostly Spirit Divine Bow, everything simply felt like a dream to her.\n‘I have to protect him.’\nWhat Jeong Hyeon saw unfolding before her eyes overlapped with what she'd seen in her mental world.\nThe scene of her intercepting the assassin who had been targeting Il-mok, which she had witnessed before in her mental world.\nCreeeeak.\nThe tension in the bowstring she'd pulled back out of habit stimulated her muscles.\nThwip!\nAnd in that moment, that sound she had heard a thousand times—the crisp snap of the taut bowstring finally escaping its suppression—was the very thing that shocked her blocked mind back to awareness.\nThwack!\nJeong Hyeon's arrow embedded itself in the forehead of a fanatic who'd been thrusting his spear at Il-mok.",

    "content": "Chapter 168: God is Great (5)\nThe murky, clouded pupils in Jeong Hyeon's eyes suddenly cleared up.\nHer already heightened senses were flooded with way too much information from the battlefield around her.\nJust when it looked like she was about to have another episode—\n\"Focus!!!\"\nEun Ryeo's voice, the only person she could truly trust and rely on, barely managed to pull Jeong Hyeon's mind back from the brink of falling into that dark abyss again.\nWhen Jeong Hyeon turned her head and looked at her with those clear eyes, Eun Ryeo repeated what she'd said moments before.\n\"Listen carefully! The people around you are not here to hurt you! They are here to protect you! Trust them! You must not be afraid, do you hear me?!”\nEun Ryeo was anxious.\nSure, Jeong Hyeon's eyes had cleared up, but her face was still deathly pale.\n“So isn’t it your duty to protect them in return?!”\nIf Jeong Hyeon spaced out again, Eun Ryeo would have to make a hard choice. She couldn't afford to keep holding her back any longer.\n‘Please! O, Heavenly Demon! Save this poor, fragile soul!’\nMaybe her prayer got through.\nJeong Hyeon started raising her bow again.\nHer face was still pale as a ghost, and blood was trickling down from her lips.\nEun Ryeo worried that Jeong Hyeon had suffered internal injuries, but that wasn't it.\n‘This is no time to be weak.’\nThat blood came from Jeong Hyeon biting her own tongue.\n“Aim for them!!”\nAs soon as Jeong Hyeon raised her bow, Eun Ryeo frantically shouted while pointing somewhere.\nShe was pointing at one of the fanatics who was chanting in some incomprehensible language while waving his staff around.\nJeong Hyeon, who was too overwhelmed to think for herself, just followed Eun Ryeo's instructions for now.\nShe nocked an arrow and aimed at the forehead of the staff-wielding fanatic.\nThen, following the principles of the Ghostly Spirit Divine Bow, she channeled her internal energy. Latest content publıshed on NoveI~Fire.net\nTwang!\nThe bowstring, released from its tension, made a crisp sound.\nThunk!\nThe sorcerer with the arrow through his forehead collapsed with a smile on his face as he'd seen Allah welcoming him through his life flashing before his eyes.\nSeeing Jeong Hyeon looking like she might collapse any second, Eun Ryeo quickly shouted, \"I'll protect Jeong Hyeon! The rest of you go help them!!\"\nAfter giving orders to the nearby disciples, Eun Ryeo immediately gave Jeong Hyeon another target.\n\"Now aim for that one!\"\nEven though she felt like she might pass out any moment, Jeong Hyeon followed on Eun Ryeo's directions like a single candle flame in the darkness, drawing her bowstring and taking aim.\n‘Phew.’\nGwak Sul quietly let out a sigh of relief that nobody else noticed.\nEver since Jeong Hyeon had snapped back to her senses and started targeting the sorcerers and commanders with her bow, their desperate situation had stabilized a bit.\nBut that relief only lasted a moment.\nThey were still in the middle of a battle, and everyone was fighting for their lives every single second.\nThat's why he shouted urgently.\nWith several sorcerers and commanders dead, cracks had appeared in the enemy formation. Now was the perfect chance to break through the escape route he'd been keeping an eye on.\n\"Break through on the right!!\"\nThe direction he pointed to while shouting was completely different from where the Vice Leader and Chu Il-hwan had been leading the charge at the front.\nWhere Gwak Sul was pointing, Dokgo Pae was going wild with his Dokgo Nine Swords.\nThe escape route Gwak Sul had spotted was there from the beginning. To be precise, it was in the opposite direction from where Vice Leader and Chu Il-hwan were breaking through.\nFrom the start, he'd known he needed to use Vice Leader and Chu Il-hwan as bait.\nAnd even without him giving specific orders, Vice Leader and Chu Il-hwan had perfectly played their role as decoys.\nThey'd gone wild with their incredible martial arts, drawing the enemies' attention, and thanks to that, the enemy formation had no choice but to lean toward their side.\nWhile the enemy formation that had been surrounding them on all sides was tilting to one side, Dokgo Pae and the Black Tiger Corps members were slowly punching through where the encirclement had thinned out. And Jeong Hyeon had started picking off the most threatening sorcerers.\nOf course, using their two strongest fighters as bait when they were already outnumbered was basically a reckless gamble.\nIf any other part of their line had broken at any moment, they would have faced total annihilation.\nThe reason they'd managed to hold out so far was thanks to several factors.\nInstructor Cheok Il-so and Xiao Hong were leading the assistant instructors and disciples to hold off the waves of fanatics, and surprisingly, Bang Mi-hwa was playing a huge role too.\nAs a practitioner of fan techniques, she was practically single-handedly blocking the flames the sorcerers created and the arrows shot from the rear, holding out until Jeong Hyeon could recover.\nEven with her clothes turned to rags from the heat of the flames, half her hair burned off, and soot stains all over her face—\n\"Ohohoho!\"\nShe laughed boldly while using her fan techniques to create wind.\nHonestly, Gwak Sul had been looking at her like she was crazy bitch during their time at the Hall of the Demonic Way, but today that smile looked beautiful to him.\nLike this, everyone was doing their part to hold on, but in Gwak Sul's opinion, someone else had played the biggest role.\n‘…If Young Master Il-mok weren’t here, we would have been wiped out by now.’\nWhenever cracks appeared in their formation, Il-mok showed up there.\nHe was there even before Gwak Sul could issue a command.\nUnlike the instructors, assistant instructors, and wounded Black Tiger Corps members who were barely managing to look after the disciples around them, he was moving while reading the flow of the entire battlefield.\nSlash!\nEven as his neck was being cut, the fanatic laughed while seeking his God, his blood splattering across faces.\nIn this battlefield full of blood and screams, Il-mok's mind, pushed to its absolute limit, was reading the flow of the entire battle.\nAn overload of information was stimulating his brain, coming through his hearing, his sight, and above all, through his qi perception.\n— West!!\n—You're too slow! Move faster!\nBefore Il-mok could even fully process all that information, his other self was already telling him which direction to go.\nHe felt like he was going insane.\nEverything on the battlefield was a raw stimulus to his overloaded senses.\nThe sweat pouring down like rain from the endless fighting. The clothes caked with the enemy's blood and the dust of the earth.\nThe shouts and screams of fanatics filling every direction.\n—You need to be more perfect!\n—Are you just going to let everyone die like this?\n—Hehehe. If you're going to fight like this, why not just hand your body over to me?\nAnd on top of that, his other self is constantly trying to steal control of his body.\n‘Please.’\nHoping this horrible fight would end even a little sooner, Il-mok kept swinging his sword.\nAnd as if to grant his wish, his overly sensitive qi perception found a gap that had opened somewhere in the enemy formation.\n\"Break through on the right!!\"\nAt that exact moment, Gwak Sul's order echoed across the battlefield.\n“Break through!”\nThe Demon Cult members, who had seemed like they were barely hanging on, all started charging in that direction at once.\nIl-mok also used his lightness skill to help them.\nSlash!\nAmid the chilling sounds of tearing flesh and screams, the small gap Dokgo Pae had opened quickly widened, and just when Dokgo Pae finally broke through the encirclement—\nThud!\nSomeone landed on the ground with light steps, blocking the only escape route that had opened.\n“Get out of my way!!”\nDokgo Pae, absorbed in his Dokgo Nine Swords, shouted boldly and fully utilized the insights he'd gained from this battle.\nHis internal energy raced through all his meridians, and his greatsword, filled with tremendous force, swung to cut the middle-aged man blocking his path in half.\n\"Ugh...\"\nAnd after just one exchange, Dokgo Pae was sent flying while letting out a faint groan as he coughed up blood.\n\"!!!\"\n\"Junior Dokgo!!\"\nThe Black Tiger Corps members who had been supporting him and clearing the path rushed at the man blocking their way with shocked faces, but they just kept getting pushed back by the scimitar he wielded.\nThe man who single-handedly blocked the escape route they had worked so hard to create moved in a bizarre fashion.\nIt wasn't just the martial arts he was using.\nThe man who had repelled the Black Tiger members right after Dokgo Pae did not just stand his ground and block the path.\nInstead,\nWhoosh!\n\"Do you really think you can escape (هل تعتقد أنه يمكنك الهروب)?!”\nHe suddenly charged at Il-mok, who had somehow made it near the escape route.\n\"Tch.\"\nIl-mok, who miraculously managed to react to that surprise attack, let out a faint groan as he blocked the scimitar the middle-aged man swung at him.\nWith their sword and curved blade locked together, Il-mok could finally get a proper look at the man's face.\n‘So it really was a trap aimed at me.’\nThe leader of the fanatics who had been calmly giving orders from the rear had finally made his move.\nThe bastard who had just leisurely watched as Chu Il-hwan and the Vice Leader slaughtered his men had now jumped into action the moment Il-mok himself tried to break free.\nHe had done it even at the cost of abandoning the very escape route he had just sealed.\nBut the strangest thing that bothered Il-mok was the man's eyes.\n‘They're different.’\nUnlike the other fanatics who welcomed even death with blind faith, flames were burning in this man's eyes.\nFlames of rage and malice.\nAnd that malice was blatantly directed at Il-mok himself.\nInexplicable hatred from someone he was meeting for the first time today.\nBut Il-mok wasn't even curious about the reason.\nClang!\n\"Ugh...\"\nHe had more pressing concerns, like simply keeping himself in one piece.\nMukhtar Khan's scimitar flew at him in a bizarre trajectory that Il-mok had never experienced before.\nClang!\nIl-mok managed to block it by following its path with his natural instincts, but the recoil transmitted through his sword when it clashed with the curved blade rippling with Saber Qi made his wrist and all his muscles feel twisted.\nOn top of that—\n—What are you afraid of?\n—You know it too, don't you? The more perfect sword path.\n—Huhahaha. The body is nothing but a tool. To yearn for one flawless sword, even at the cost of your body... that is the definition of a martial artist!\nIn his mind, the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword kept whispering relentlessly.\n\"Shut the fuck up!!!\"\nDriven to rage, Il-mok roared as he swung his sword back.\nClang!\nAs sword and curved blade clashed and life and death hung in the balance, the noise coming from all sides, the sweat and blood covering his entire body, the disgusting feeling of the dirt and grime... That damn side effect of his Demonic Art and the searing pain that shot through his body with every single clash of their blades.\n‘...Why do I have to go through this?’\nIl-mok wanted to give up on everything.\nHe'd dreamed of a peaceful life where he could just work casually and have fun. What meaning could there possibly be in a life like this, a desperate struggle filled with nothing but pain?\nClang!!\nOnce again, Il-mok's sword and Mukhtar Khan's curved blade clashed, and Il-mok's stance, overwhelmed by the tremendous force, wavered.\n\"There is only one God in the world (لا يوجد سوى إله واحد في العالم )!\" shouted Mukhtar Khan as he raised his scimitar.\nIntense energy waves rippled around his body, and his continuously flowing internal energy formed Saber Qi that layered upon itself.\nWhen Mukhtar Khan swung his scimitar at the defenseless Il-mok, the Saber Qi accumulated on his scimitar had already formed a constellation of stars.\nSaber Qi Manifest Constellation (刀氣成罡).\nIl-mok looked with a half-dazed expression at the brilliant constellation of stars that seemed ready to give him eternal rest.\nSlash!\nBlood splattered with a disgusting cutting sound and his vision shook, but strangely, he felt no pain.\nIt took Il-mok a moment to understand what had happened.\nThat cutting sound and blood weren't his own..\nThe woman who had thrown her entire body in front of him to save him was now lying on top of him as she bled.\nEven with her deathly pale face, she still smiled like an idiot, \"How about it, Young Master? Isn't this enough to pass as your attendant?\"\n\"......\"\nWas it because of the sudden shock of falling to the ground? For a moment, Il-mok could only stare blankly, unable to process what had just happened.\nJu Seo-yeon spoke again.\n\"If we make it back alive, will you take me in as your attendant?\"\nHer determination to become his attendant even at the cost of her life brought expression back to Il-mok's face.\n“Don’t you dare raise a death flag like that.”\nIl-mok, back to his usual expression of finding everything bothersome, quickly moved his hands to press Ju Seo-yeon's pressure points.\nAfter stopping her bleeding, Il-mok carefully stood up to avoid reopening her wounds and said, \"You'll have to graduate from the Hall of the Demonic Way and become Lady Jin's junior, you know?\"\nAt Il-mok's definitive answer, Ju Seo-yeon smiled brightly and passed out.\nIt was a smile that didn't belong on a battlefield.\nAnd Il-mok, now fully standing, muttered in a low voice.\n\"Fine. I'll do as you want, you son of a bitch.\"\nThe veins on the back of the hand that gripped his sword bulged.\nWhether his muscles were torn to shreds or his bones were broken. Whether his meridians were twisted, or the Demonic Art drove him insane —\n“Let’s just see it, then. This ‘perfect sword path,’ or whatever the hell you call it. Let’s see this damned sword of yours.”\nThat was something future Il-mok would have to worry about. It had nothing to do with the him of right now.",

    "content": "Chapter 169: God is Great (6)\nIl-mok gripped his sword tight, the battlefield reflected in his eyes.\n“Keuk.”\nBefore he knew it, a few Black Tiger Corps members nearby had stepped in to block that bastard for him.\nTing!\nAn arrow shot from afar bounced right off the scimitar the guy was swinging.\nBut even with Jeong Hyeon providing support from a distance, the four Black Tiger Corps members were getting pushed back hard.\n\"ابتعد عن الطريق (Out of my way)!”\nWhen the leader roared and swung his scimitar with brutal force, the Black Tiger Corps members couldn't hold their ground and got sent flying.\nWhoosh!\nRight at that moment, Il-mok launched himself forward.\n\"Disciple Il-mok?!\"\nIgnoring the surprised shouts of the Black Tiger Corps members, Il-mok pushed his speed to the extreme and thrust his sword forward.\nClang!\nBut despite having just unleashed a powerful attack of his own, Mukhtar Khan blocked Il-mok’s surprise assault with ease.\n“Heheheheh.”\nThe fanatic leader's eyes glinted with glee as he grinned like he was about to drool with pleasure.\nIl-mok shouted, \"I'll handle this bastard, so get the wounded out of here!\"\nHe wasn't just thinking of Ju Seo-yeon when he said that.\nDokgo Pae, who'd first clashed head-on with that fanatic leader, had taken serious internal injuries, and several other disciples were hurt too.\nBlocking the relentless waves of attacks from these death-fearing fanatics coming from all sides wasn't exactly a walk in the park.\nMaybe Il-mok talking while fighting pissed him off.\nMukhtar Khan suddenly swung his blade with vicious force.\nIl-mok reacted quickly, using the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's twelfth form, Soul Jade Sphere, to create a sword barrier.\nCRASH!!\nBut maybe because his breathing was off from all the shouting, he got pushed back a step and blood trickled from his mouth.\nAs pain twisted through his guts like they were being wrung out, Il-mok's mouth curved in a weird smile.\n\"Fine. Go ahead and go wild, you goddamn son of a bitch.\"\nThat wasn't meant for the enemy leader.\nIt was directed at the other personality in his head that had just told him to use the Soul Jade Sphere.\nIt kept bitching in his head since his execution had been too slow and less refined than what it wanted.\nEven while Il-mok was arguing with the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, Mukhtar Khan kept swinging his scimitar.\nBut this time, the result was different.\nAfter entrusting Ju Seo-yeon to the Black Tiger Corps members, Il-mok gave control of his body to his other ego, just like he'd promised the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\nThe scimitar came flying in a completely different trajectory from other demonic cult swordsmen.\nAnd yet, despite its bizarre and unpredictable movement, the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword deflected the scimitar with ease.\nTing!!\nFor the first time, confusion crossed Mukhtar Khan's face.\nHe was a man in his prime.\nAfter the Heavenly Demon wiped out his tribe, he'd built his people up from nothing to get here. His combat experience was on a level Il-mok couldn't even dream of touching.\nNo matter how Il-mok swung his sword, Mukhtar Khan handled it easily.\nThat’s a true fact proven by his eyes.\nClang!\nBut at some point, things changed.\nThe little lamb, who was meant as a sacrifice in this Holy War, started responding differently.\n‘He is definitely weaker than me, so how…?’\nThe bizarre, unpredictable movements of his uniquely shaped scimitar. On top of that, there was a difference in speed and power that came from the gap in their cultivation realms.\nNo matter how they fought, this should've been his fight to win.\nBut somehow that brat kept blocking and deflecting his scimitar, even landing counterattacks here and there.\nAnd Il-mok, who'd handed control to the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, could see why.\nHe could also see exactly what the hell the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword was pulling.\n'Crazy fucker...'\nUsing eyesight and qi perception that even the Heavenly Demon acknowledged as talent, it read the enemy's movements.\nIt wasn't just looking and reacting.\nIt read the opponent’s next move based on a multitude of factors. Their habits, their techniques observed during the fight, their current posture, and even the flow of their qi.\nBut even reading one move ahead could not erase the undeniable gap in their cultivation realms.\nSo the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword didn't clash head-on.\nSince it was slower, it swung the sword one step ahead based on predicted movements.\nSince it was weaker, it pushed the principle of strength to extremes.\nClang!!\nAt the moment of impact, it switched to using the principle of softness, deflecting a portion of the enemy's power.\nIt was a paradoxical act.\nSwinging with everything you've got, then changing course at the last second.\nThe reason this contradictory move was possible was simple.\nEven though he'd handed over control of his body, Il-mok hadn't lost his sense of self, so he could feel it.\nThe horrific agony coursing through his entire body.\nEvery time the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword swung once, every muscle in his body screamed.\nA single sword strike uses both the Soul-Crushing Sword which focuses on strength while also executing the Soul-Severing Flash that focus on speed at the same time.\nJust that alone pushed his muscles and joints to their limits, and then at the end, the Soul-Guiding Sword's focus on softness got mixed in, creating a whole new sword technique.\nBut the real problem wasn't the first fourteen forms.\nIf the first fourteen forms of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword were about how to swing a sword, the latter eight techniques were about how to handle qi.\nClang!!\nMukhtar Khan, clashing weapons with Il-mok, frowned at the strange rebound he felt.\nThat was the power of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's Second Secret Technique, the Soul-Rebounding Sword.\nAnd then.\n\"!?\"\nA grayish energy suddenly flew at him, forcing Mukhtar Khan to quickly twist his head to dodge.\nThe Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's Third Secret Technique, the Traceless Soul-Slicing Sword.\nOriginally, it was a technique for generating two streams of Sword Qi while executing a swing that utilized the principle of speed, similar to the Soul-Cutting Flash.\nOne stream would be swung along with the blade it was wrapped around, while the other would be secretly fired at the opponent like a hidden weapon.\nAnd now, the ego of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword controlling Il-mok's body was using Soul Rebounding Sword and Traceless Soul-Shaving Sword simultaneously.\nIt imbued the rebound force into the Sword Qi on the blade while secretly shooting that grayish Sword Qi for a surprise attack.\nIn the process of using different techniques' principles at the same time, the internal energy flowing through Il-mok's meridians underwent rapid, repeated changes.\nThe bizarre shifting internal energy twisted his meridians, and the metallic taste of blood rose in his throat.\nEvery muscle, joint, and meridian in his body screamed as internal injuries piled up.\n“Heheheh.”\nBut a strange laugh leaked from Il-mok's mouth.\nAfter that, the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword kept mixing various principles with each swing of the sword, and his body screamed in response.\nFor a moment, Il-mok watched from inside as the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword seemed hell-bent on destroying his own body.\nClang!!\nIn the moment he blocked another powerful swing of the scimitar and allowed the repulsive force to throw his body backward,\n'Now fuck off.'\nIl-mok suddenly seized control again, and his eyes returned to their usual indifferent look.\n— Tsk. Still nowhere near enough.\nIgnoring the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's disappointed grumbling, Il-mok watched the enemy charging at him.\nIt wasn’t the horrific pain radiating through his entire body that had made him take back control.\nHe knew that without fighting this way, he couldn't handle someone way more skilled than him.\nIt’s simple because he'd just gotten an idea while watching the fight.\n'If I could just ignore the pain, I could probably do this too.'\nThanks to calmly observing the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword’s battle, he could finally understand why the damn bastard was always nagging him with its advice.\nHe also understood just how one-dimensionally he had been using the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword all this time.\nAnd since watching his body move on its own like a puppet felt like absolute shit, he decided to try it himself, just as the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword had demonstrated.\nUsing his extremely heightened focus, he stared down the leader.\nHe wasn't just looking at the guy's scimitar or the arm holding it.\nHe was taking in the man's entire posture, the focus of his gaze, and even the aura of power emanating from his body.\n'Lower left.'\nAt the exact same instant he read the enemy’s movement, he twisted his body and thrust his sword.\nHis body was screaming at him.\nMove like this and you'll destroy yourself completely.\nBut.\n‘I’m going to die either way, so it makes no fucking difference. Why the fuck not go for it?’\nHe gritted his teeth and ignored his body's warnings.\nMaybe because he moved one step ahead.\nClang!\nThe sword that clashed with the enemy didn't carry the same heavy pressure as before.\nIt was ridiculous.\nThe pressure coming from the enemy's scimitar had vanished, but only because he was now destroying his own body in its place.\nEven in this damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't situation, Il-mok just kept swinging his sword and throwing his body around.\nWhen he first learned the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, Il-mok thought it was a sword art that aimed for perfection.\nBut he'd misunderstood what 'perfection' meant.\nTraining the Soul-Departing Sword, he learned to draw his sword from any stance.\nTraining the Soul-Crushing Sword, he learned to swing a strong sword from any position.\nTraining the Soul-Severing Flash, he learned to swing a fast sword from any form.\nTraining the Soul-Guiding Sword, he learned to deflect enemy attacks from any direction.\nTraining the Soul Jade Sphere, he learned to block enemy attacks from any other technique.\nAnd so, he'd thought the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword was a martial art that allowed one to endlessly deploy various principles like strength, speed, softness, and illusion regardless of stance.\nNo, that wasn't quite right.\nThrough his various experiences at the Hall of the Demonic Way, he had already been vaguely starting to grasp its true meaning.\nDuring the rampage of Chu Il-hwan's attack, and during Instructor Jeong Gyu-seok's attack, he'd had experience mixing several concepts while swinging his sword.\nBut Il-mok had been consciously ignoring that enlightenment.\nBecause he was scared of going crazy.\nUnlike other demonic cult members obsessed with their martial arts, Il-mok didn't want to become a psycho.\nIt was because of that fear that he had always used the latter eight techniques in such a simplistic manner.\nHe could freely chain each technique together, but he'd never once tried mixing multiple techniques in one movement.\nBut not anymore.\nHe didn’t like people like Ju Seo-yeon and her ilk. Their whole way of thinking defied common sense.\nBut still, he couldn't bring himself to let them die. Thɪs chapter is updatᴇd by novel(ꜰ)ire.net\nSo.\n‘I am going home alive…’\nEven if advancing his Demonic Art made him suffer from a more serious mental illness.\n‘...together with these goddamn cultist nutjobs.’\nEven if overusing demonic energy crushed his bones and muscles and twisted his meridians and organs!\nSHWIIIIING!\nIl-mok's sword aimed for Mukhtar Khan's heart.\nClang!\nMukhtar Khan blocked Il-mok's sword while twisting his head.\nThe grayish Sword Qi formed by the Traceless Soul-Slicing Sword was targeting his head.\nNaturally, Mukhtar Khan wasn't dumb enough to fall for the same technique twice.\nBut.\n\"!?\"\nTo his astonishment, the blurry Sword Qi that looked like it was aiming for his head strangely changed course like a snake.\nThe Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's Fourth Secret Technique, the Heartless Coiling Serpent. A technique that uses the principle of softness to make the Sword Qi itself, rather than the blade, twist and bend through the air was unleashed, then combined with the Traceless Soul-Slicing Sword.\nStartled, Mukhtar Khan quickly threw his body backward, barely dodging the Sword Qi.\nIl-mok swung his sword at the retreating Mukhtar Khan.\nIt was a kaleidoscopic flurry of movements that encompassed every principle and secret art of the fourteen forms and the eight techniques that all blended into one.\nEven Il-mok himself couldn't exactly comprehend how he was swinging his sword.\nNo, he didn't want to comprehend it.\nThe moment he questioned his movements, he instinctively knew all his insights would vanish like a mirage.\nSo instead of questioning, Il-mok focused purely on the fight.\nAnd at some point.\nIl-mok could finally understand why the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword had been so rough with his body.\nMaybe because all his senses were focused on the enemy to predict their movements, completely immersed in combat at the crossroads of life and death.\nThe screaming from his body couldn't be heard anymore.\n— The transition between forms is slow!\n— Your internal energy flow is rough!\nEven the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's bullshit commentary in his head sounded distant.\nClang!\nThe desperate battlefield situation didn't come to mind anymore either.\nIn Il-mok's mind, lost in a trance, only the sword remained.\nIl-mok didn't realize it, but at some point, his other self had also fallen completely silent.\nThe moment Mukhtar Khan swung his scimitar again, Il-mok saw only one path.\nIt was a path his current level absolutely couldn't follow, but Il-mok didn't care.\nThe internal energy remaining in his dantian surged up all at once, rushing through his entire body's meridians.\nThe screams of his body pushed to its limits couldn't stop Il-mok.\nInternal energy that flowed through his meridians according to countless concepts and principles of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword concentrated into one point.\nAnd when his sword tip reached the end of the path he'd seen—\nFor the first time, the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword gave praise.\n— Perfect!!\nA brilliant cluster of stars had formed on his sword.\nIt was Sword Force.",

    "content": "Chapter 170: God is Great (7)\nEven though he'd managed to form that overwhelming Sword Force that seemed capable of cutting through anything, there was no satisfying sound of steel slicing flesh.\nBOOM!!\nInstead, a violent explosion erupted with a burst of energy.\nIl-mok's sword, wrapped in brilliant Sword Force, had been blocked by a curved blade.\nSomehow, Mukhtar Khan had also formed Saber Force and managed to block Il-mok's perfect strike.\nDisbelief flickered across Mukhtar Khan's face as he held back Il-mok's sword. It was an expression that didn't suit a religious fanatic at all.\n‘This fucking monster...’\nBlood was already trickling from the corner of his mouth.\nThanks to countless real battles and his absolute faith in his God, he'd gained some understanding of energy manipulation. But maybe because it was a power granted by his God, he couldn't control it freely.\nForming a Force required extreme concentration and time, so he only used it as a one-hit-kill technique when a sure opportunity presented itself.\nBut this damn kid, not even twenty years old, had suddenly formed Sword Force out of nowhere. And the way he came at him with that bizarre sword path that seemed impossible to dodge... Mukhtar Khan had no choice but to summon his own Force, accepting internal injuries in the process.\n‘So it is true… The disciple of the Evil God is a seed that will one day sprout into an Evil God himself.’\nA monster that grew at a terrifying rate with each clash.\nMukhtar Khan was certain of it.\n‘What a blessing that I have the chance to kill him now! This too must be a sign that Allah is watching over this Mukhtar Khan!’\nRight now, he could kill that brat.\nThe Evil God's spawn that clashed weapons with him was trembling all over with blood leaking nonstop from his seven orifices.\nHe looks like his whole body might explode at any moment.\nUnlike himself, who was blessed by the great God Allah, this brat dared to use divine power without THEIR permission.\nA cruel smile spread across Mukhtar Khan's lips as he became certain of his opponent's death.\nScreeeech.\nBut it was too late as an unpleasant sound pierced his ears.\n\"!!!\"\nHis eyes, which had been focused entirely on the Evil God's spawn, finally caught sight of something small.\nAn arrow flying through the air, piercing space itself.\nThat arrow was aimed precisely at Mukhtar Khan's forehead.\nMukhtar Khan frantically twisted his body and barely managed to dodge the arrow.\nBut his concentration was broken, and the Saber Force coating his scimitar had grown dim.\nSchlick!\nWith that disgusting cutting sound, Mukhtar Khan felt something had gone terribly wrong.\nHis curved blade, which had felt like part of his body, now felt different from usual.\nThe world suddenly tilted, and the ground was rushing up to meet him.\nThud.\nThrough the sound of something hitting the ground, Mukhtar Khan's eyes caught sight of something strange.\nA familiar torso, severed at the chest.\n‘This can't be...’\nHis vision blurred, and eternal darkness began to swallow him.\nBut for some reason...\n‘Allah...’\nEven though he'd met his death in a Holy War, the paradise he'd longed for was nowhere to be seen.\nSCHLICK!!\nIn the chaotic battlefield, a small cutting sound rang out.\nThough it was certainly a small noise, the gaze of every single person was turning toward its source.\nBoth the fanatics and the demon cult members had disbelief written in their eyes.\nThe fanatics couldn't easily accept the sight of their Khan's body cut in half.\nAnd the demon cult members were mesmerized by the brilliant constellation of stars coating Il-mok's sword.\nThe emotions both groups felt started similarly, but ended up in different places.\nWhen humans witness something they can't believe, they tend to seek God.\n\"The Heavenly Demon Descent!!\"\n\"Ten Thousand Demons Obey!!!\"\nThe demon cult members were certain. This was truly a blessing from their god. A new hope for the Divine Cult that the Heavenly Demon had discovered.\nMeanwhile, anxiety crept into the fanatics' eyes.\nThis battle was supposed to be a Holy War, so how could it be that the Khan, the chosen warrior of their God, was lying there like that?\nJust as they began to sense something was going wrong...\nThump.\nThe young monster who'd slaughtered their Khan collapsed to the ground like a broken puppet.\nRight after cutting down Mukhtar Khan, Il-mok had snapped out of his trance and passed out cold.\nOnce again, both sides reacted in completely opposite ways.\n\"Allahu Akbar!!\"\nThe fanatics, desperate to believe that their god was still on their side, charged forward with fire in their eyes.\n\"Protect the Eighth Young Master!!\"\n\"Whatever it takes, we have to save the Young Master!!\"\nThe demon cult members also swung their weapons as if their lives meant nothing.\nOne of the Black Tiger Corps members fighting closest to Il-mok quickly threw himself forward and scooped up the unconscious boy.\nSeveral other Black Tiger Corps members formed a protective formation around him, cutting down enemies as they rapidly carved out an escape route.\nFollowing Il-mok's earlier instructions, they needed to link up with the group that had already broken through the encirclement, the one that included the wounded like Ju Seo-yeon and Dokgo Pae.\nA few instructors and disciples who'd stayed behind to the very end formed a rear guard to hold off the fanatics.\nSchlick!\nAs cutting sounds and screams echoed from all directions...\n\"Ugh...\"\nA pained groan came from directly beside Xiao Hong.\nShe thought it might be a fanatic’s death rattle, but somehow the voice sounded familiar.\nXiao Hong’s head turned reflexively, and her eyes fell upon the sight of a fanatic thrusting his spear toward a student who had a deep gash in their thigh.\nXiao Hong swung her sword without any hesitation.\nCRUNCH!\nHer sword plunged into the heart of the fanatic who'd dared attack a Hall of the Demonic Way’s disciple.\nBut before she could even pull her sword from the fanatic's body...\nA curved blade flying toward her neck filled her vision completely.\nThat curved blade had been aimed at her from the start. This was simply the result of her having chosen to protect the student instead of defending herself against it.\nShe didn't even know why she'd made that choice herself.\nThis was just the Hall of the Demonic Way that she'd been forced to enter because of her Chief's orders.\nShe'd thought that once she dragged Il-mok to the Law Enforcement Hall, she'd have no more business here.\nBut maybe she'd grown attached over the past few months, she found she couldn’t bring herself to ignore the danger threatening a mere student, even one who wasn't Il-mok.\nEven though she couldn't understand her own actions, she felt strangely liberated.\nThe hunger from her binge eating disorder wasn't attacking her, and she even felt an inexplicable sense of accomplishment.\n‘Teaching and protecting students isn't so bad after all.’ ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ novel-fire.net\nJust as she thought this and prepared to bravely accept the approaching death, the curved blade flying toward her stopped moving.\nAt the same time, a golden-brown scent stimulated her nose.\nIt wasn't a scent that triggered her hunger.\nIt was the smell of burning human flesh.\n\"Excellent work, Instructor Xiao!\"\nBeyond the electrocuted corpse standing upright, a familiar voice called out.\nAfter the powerless fanatic's body collapsed, she could see Chu Il-hwan covered head to toe in blood.\n\"Lead the disciples out of here! I'll buy time with the Vice Leader before escaping.\"\nHe'd originally been trying to break through, but ended up playing decoy thanks to Gwak Sul's quick thinking. He had taken on the role of a decoy and ended up surrounded by countless fanatics along with the Vice Leader.\nBut while Dokgo Pae was carving out an escape route and Il-mok was dealing with the enemy leader, Chu Il-hwan and the Vice Leader had finally managed to break through that thick encirclement.\nAnd despite having just fought his way out of the most difficult part of the battlefield, he now willingly stays behind until the very end to help his comrades escape.\n\"Once I get the disciples to safety, I'll definitely come back.\"\nAt Xiao Hong's response, Chu Il-hwan gave his characteristic mischievous smile.\n\"Haha. By then, the Vice Leader and I will have already escaped, so there's no need to come back.\"\nIt was a smile that didn't match his age, but Xiao Hong found it quite charming.\nXiao Hong launched herself forward, scooping up the disciple she'd just saved while deploying her lightness skill.\nShe remembered that disciple had been cut in the thigh.\nAfter Xiao Hong and the disciple escaped, followed by all the remaining disciples, instructors, and assistant instructors...\n\"Phew.\"\n\"Guess we need to push ourselves a bit more.\"\nChu Il-hwan let out a light sigh while the Vice Leader maintained his stoic expression, both scattering black lightning and Saber Qi as they faced the fanatics.\nFor what seemed like an eternity, Xiao Hong ran, ignoring the screams and roars of the fanatics that echoed from behind her.\nXiao Hong's breathing was starting to get labored.\nNever mind that she was running while carrying a cadet in her arms, never mind that she had expended twice her normal energy fighting to protect the others...\n‘Please, Heavenly Demon.’\nIf she, an instructor, was getting this tired, the disciples must have no strength left to run. Realizing this, she could only pray to their god for some kind of miracle.\nIt was then that in the far distance, the undergrowth began to shake, and a new group of people began to emerge.\n\"Battle formation!\"\nXiao Hong shouted this command, but deep in her chest, a snake called despair was slithering upward.\n‘I cannot show any weakness.’\nSetting down the disciple she'd been carrying, Xiao Hong raised her sword and forced a resolute expression onto her face.\nThat solemn expression, which had been prepared for death, quickly began to contort.\nShe'd realized the true identity of what she'd thought was the snake of despair.\nBehind the newly appeared group, a flag with a red turtle design was fluttering.\nIt was the Red Turtle Corps, one of the Demon Cult's sixteen martial units.\n\"What a sorry state you're in.\"\nAfter annihilating the fanatics who'd dared invade the sacred mountain of the Divine Cult...\nThe Red Turtle Corps Leader spoke to Black Tiger Corps Leader Ouyang Hyeok with a languid expression.\nJust as he'd promised, Ouyang Hyeok had bought time for the disciples and wounded Black Tiger Corps members to escape before cutting through the fanatics and breaking out of the encirclement.\nAnd only then could they realize they'd been deceived by the enemy.\nFollowing the trail of their allies who'd escaped first, they'd arrived at a place soaked with blood.\nThere, the Black Tiger Corps Vice Leader and the Head Instructor Chu Il-hwan were fighting fanatics, desperately trying to break out of their encirclement.\nOuyang Hyeok and the Black Tiger Corps members joined the battle to help them, but when the original group that had surrounded them joined up, they found themselves encircled again.\nBut fortunately, thanks to the Red Turtle Corps arriving at just the right time, they were able to annihilate all the fanatics.\nIn response to the teasing from the Red Turtle Corps Leader who had just saved them, Ouyang Hyeok smiled bitterly\n\"It'll just sound like excuses if I say it now, but if it weren't for those Hall of the Demonic Way disciples, our Black Tiger Corps alone could have swept through those bastards.\"\nOuyang Hyeok truly believed this.\nCompared to their total numbers, the proportion of experts wasn't that high.\nHe was confident that if they had fought a guerrilla war on the familiar terrain of the Tianshan Mountain Range as their battlefield, they could have won easily.\nBut those bastards were crazy enough to laugh while using their own allies' deaths to their advantage. Fighting such enemies while protecting the disciples with almost no real combat experience wasn't easy.\n\"You're right, they were pretty weak. But they are insane. Hahaha.\"\nWhen the Red Turtle Corps Leader readily agreed with him, Ouyang Hyeok let out a light sigh.\nThis just made them look incompetent for almost losing to such weak opponents.\n“Hahaha! It was a joke, a joke! Don’t take it so seriously. Like you said, it happened because you were protecting the disciples. There were quite a few of them too, and some decent fighters were mixed in among them.\"\nWhen the Black Tiger Corps Leader sighed, the Red Turtle Corps Leader spoke soothingly before getting to the main point.\n“But tell me, how was the Eighth Young Master?”\n\"He was definitely outstanding for his age, but I sent him ahead first so I didn't get to observe him in much detail myself.”\nOuyang Hyeok answered honestly, then turned his head to look somewhere else.\nToward the Vice Leader, who was covered in blood from the fierce battle.\nThe Red Turtle Corps Leader's gaze also followed Ouyang Hyeok toward the Vice Leader, and the Black Tiger Corps's Vice Leader recalled that scene to answer their question.\nThe sight of a young brat, one who hadn’t even finished his training at the Hall of the Demonic Way, manifesting a brilliant constellation of stars upon his sword.\n\"I believe he's a talent that will become a new god for our Divine Cult in the future.\"\nComing from the notoriously stoic Vice Leader, this high praise left both leaders stunned.",

    "content": "Chapter 171: Extremity (1)\nWhen I opened my eyes, I saw a familiar ceiling staring back at me.\n\"Ugh. What is this, some kind of annual tradition?\"\nEvery year—no, roughly twice a year—I find myself staring up at this damn medical wing ceiling. As I muttered to myself, a familiar voice reached my ears.\n“You are awake.”\n\"!?\"\nStartled, I whipped my head around to see Master looking down at me.\nI tried to quickly sit up and bow properly, but Master spoke first.\n\"That's enough. What matters is the heart, not the outward appearance. Do you intend to make this old man a foolish elder who demands courtesies even from the severely injured? Hahaha.”\nThe way he insisted he wasn't some old-fashioned geezer made him look exactly like an old-fashioned geezer.\nCompletely oblivious to his own old-fashioned ways, Master looked down at me with a complicated expression, one that was a mix of satisfaction and worry.\n\"Now that I think about it, calling it an annual tradition... that seems pretty accurate, seeing how often you're in and out of this infirmary.\"\n\"Haha... I guess I'm just a bit unlucky, Master.\"\n\"Luck...\"\nMaster stroked his beard with a strange expression before continuing.\n\"I'm not sure if it's bad luck or good luck considering how fast you're growing.\"\nI had a pretty good idea what Master was getting at.\nA certain Western philosopher once said that what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.\nAnd in my opinion, the most intuitive embodiment of this maxim was the world-famous manga Dragon Ball.\nSo basically...\n'I'm not a fucking Saiyan or something.'\nSince I keep getting stronger every time I nearly die, Master wondered whether this is a good thing or a bad thing.\nOf course, from my perspective, it was complete bullshit.\nGetting stronger every time I nearly kicked the bucket wasn't exactly what I'd been hoping for.\n'I don't want to die, and I don't want to get stronger either.'\nThe former was a given, but I wanted to avoid the latter because of the damn side effects.\nThough this time, I had no choice but to get stronger to avoid dying.\nMaybe it was because I was remembering what happened right before I passed out, that final sword strike I unleashed in those last moments kept flickering through my mind.\nBut the memory of it wasn't clear, like there was a thick fog covering it.\nTo clear away that fog, I felt like I needed to swing my sword right now.\nMy body was twitching restlessly, but strangely, I didn't feel any pain.\nI definitely remembered getting the shit beaten out of me while fighting that fanatic leader at the end.\n\"Master, how long has it been since they brought me to the infirmary?\"\n\"Nearly a full month has passed.\"\n\"!?\"\nI was unconscious for a whole month? Get full chapters from NoveI★Fire.net\n“Do you have any idea how startled this old man was when you were first carried in? Still, it is a true relief that you are so healthy now.”\nMaster added that every muscle in my body had been twisted, my internal injuries are severe and barely any of my meridians were intact.\n\"The Demonic Physician and I worked together for days to barely save your life. Hahaha.”\nMaster used his profound internal energy to support my qi and blood, while the Demonic Physician came by whenever he could to treat my internal injuries and muscles with acupuncture.\nThanks to Master continuously protecting my qi and blood, I finally entered a stable condition on the fourth day.\nAnd now, more than twenty days later, I had finally woken up.\nMaster, who had been wearing a worried expression while recounting those dangerous moments, was now looking down at me with satisfaction.\n\"Still, it's good that you survived like this.\"\n\"That's true, Master.\"\n\"Hehe. And I heard the story too. It seems you gained quite an achievement from this battle.\"\n\"...My memory's pretty hazy, so I'm not entirely sure.\"\n“Hmm. In that case, try to tell me about the true meaning of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword that you have come to understand.”\nI furrowed my brow and tried to recall that day's memories.\nThe final sword strike was blurry, but I could remember most of the process of fighting that fanatic leader.\nI also remembered the insights I'd gained during that process, at least somewhat.\n\"I believe the predecessor who created the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword was obsessed with swords, or perhaps even mad about them.\"\n\"Oh? What makes you think so?\"\nAs Master's eyes lit up with interest, I spoke calmly.\nThe first fourteen forms of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword all discuss one thing.\nHow to swing a sword quickly. How to swing a sword powerfully. How to swing a sword accurately. How to smoothly deflect an opponent's sword. How to deploy deceptive feints.\nThough there were merely fourteen forms, they contained countless principles of the sword, including strength, speed, softness, flexibility, and more.\nWhile most martial arts typically focus on mastering one or two principles to their limits, this Demonic Art tried to encompass every principle that could be expressed with a sword.\nThe latter eight techniques weren't much different either. The only difference was that these techniques were performed with Sword Qi instead of wielding the sword with the body.\nIn other words, the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword aimed to encompass every technique and principle that could be deployed with sword and qi.\nFurthermore...\n\"It didn't seem to aim for deploying various techniques and principles separately, but rather to harmonize them all as one.\"\nWhile other sword arts dream of 'the most powerful strike' or aim for 'the fastest strike,' or like those orthodox martial arts that try to embody plum blossoms or embrace the principles of Taiji...\nThe Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword was an insane martial art that truly dreamed of perfecting the 'sword' itself.\n“And it even uses the side effect of compulsion to achieve it.”\nIt was such a crazy martial art that it made whoever learned it develop mental illness just to achieve that perfection.\nThat's why the creator of this martial art had to be obsessed with or completely mad about swords.\nAs I rambled on about what I'd realized regarding the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, Master listened quietly without interrupting once. Surprisingly un-hardass-like of him.\nAnd right after I finished explaining all my insights, Master stroked his beard with satisfaction and spoke, \"Hehe. I was worried whether this old man's expectations might have been misplaced, but it's exactly as I anticipated.\"\n\"???\"\nAs confusion filled my eyes, Master suddenly offered me congratulations.\n\"Congratulations, my disciple. You have begun to break free from the Extremity of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\"\n\"!? Wait, I didn't just reach Extremity; I've started to break free from it?\"\nIt was shocking news that made my eyes go wide.\nWhat was the reason I didn't want to get stronger? Why had I always slacked off at the Hall of the Demonic Way?\nBecause I was afraid of those damn side effects getting worse.\nIt was absolutely not because I was an inherently lazy person.\nBut if I'd reached Extremity, that meant the side effects were already at their peak.\nConversely, it meant that from now on, the stronger I got, the weaker the side effects would become.\n'Training's still a pain in the ass though...'\nAs joy at the possibility of saying goodbye to those damn side effects mixed with my laziness, Master's voice snapped me back to attention.\n\"Haha. That's right. Your enlightenment has already begun to break free from Extremity. The only problem is that only your 'understanding of the sword' has broken free.\"\nWondering what the hell he meant now, I looked at Master who was kind enough to add an explanation.\n\"Your mind has awakened to the true meaning of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, but your body lacks the strength to withstand that enlightenment.\"\n\"!?\"\n\"Even though this old man has lived for over a hundred years, this is the first time I've seen a case like yours. It's quite fascinating. So fascinating that I even had some absurd thoughts.\"\n\"What kind of absurd thoughts?\"\n\"I even wondered if this might be what happens when an ancient master inhabits a young body through some ridiculous mystical art like Soul Transference from old legends. Hahaha.”\n\"......\"\nI almost flinched without realizing it.\nWhile I wasn’t a grandmaster from a past era, the part about possessing a body was true.\n\"Ha, haha. That's a ridiculous fantasy, Master.\"\nFeeling like things might get dangerous if the conversation went on, I quickly changed the subject.\n\"So what should I do from now on?\"\nMaster, apparently dismissing soul transference as absurd, answered without suspicion.\n\"Obviously, you need to train. So your body can catch up to your enlightenment.\"\n\"You mean focus on external training?\"\n\"Both external and internal cultivation are lacking. You need to expand your dantian and continuously circulate qi to strengthen your meridians as well.\"\nAfter saying this, Master tilted his head and added, \"Now that I think about it, it's quite strange. Your sword mastery has advanced by leaps and bounds, but your external and internal cultivation levels haven't changed much since the last time you were brought in.\"\nThen, as if he'd figured something out, Master let out a soft exclamation and reached his own conclusion.\n\"You must have been too intoxicated by the side effects and focused only on swordsmanship. Hmm. That might indeed be why you're showing these symptoms.\"\nI quietly sighed in relief.\nThe reason my internal and external cultivation hadn't improved much compared to last time was simple.\nI'd barely trained at all.\nFrom that perspective, my mastery of the sword should have remained stagnant as well.\nIt was only because crazy bastards kept trying to kill me that I'd gained all this unnecessary combat experience.\nOf course, I couldn’t imagine what terrible things might happen if my Master discovered I had neglected my training for the past several months.\n“Th-This incompetent disciple is sorry for repeatedly showing how he is swayed by the side effects of the Demonic Art.”\nI gladly threw the side effects under the bus.\n—You despicable bastard! It's all because you're lazy!\nThe damn side effect that had awakened in my head along with me kept nagging on something, but that wasn't my problem.\nMaybe because I'd brought up the side effects, Master spoke with a serious expression.\n\"Listen carefully, my disciple.\"\n\"I'm listening attentively.\"\n\"Since your body can't keep up with your enlightenment, you're in quite a dangerous state right now. As I said before, until your internal and external cultivation reach levels befitting of Extremity, you must not touch a sword if possible.\"\nHearing Master's advice, the side effect in my head started going berserk.\n—Don't listen to that demon!\n—The sword! I’m telling you to grab your sword! You must perform that perfect strike from before!\nIt wasn't just going berserk.\nLike a drug addict, my body kept trembling involuntarily, and my right hand—the one I usually held my sword with—kept twitching as if I was dying to swing a sword right now.\nObserving my condition, Master frowned and shouted with his internal energy:\n\"HAH!!\"\nThe tremendous demonic energy contained in that shout crushed the side effect, which retreated deep into my mind.\nAs my body calmed down somewhat, I cautiously opened my mouth to speak.\nIt was because an important problem had just occurred to me.\n\"Master, if nearly a month has passed since I collapsed, shouldn't I be heading out for field training again soon?\"\n\"Don't worry about that. I'll inform the Hall Master. For the remainder of your time at the Hall of the Demonic Way, you should focus solely on training your internal and external cultivation.\"\nIt was the moment I got exempted from the Hall of the Demonic Way's educational program.\nAs expected, life is all about connections.",

    "content": "Chapter 172: Extremity (2)\nAfter finishing his advice, Master gave his orders.\n“Bring some food.”\nA hearty meal was prepared for me, who had been unconscious for the better part of a month.\nOf course, since it was meant for a patient who hadn't eaten for a month, it was all porridge and finely chopped dishes.\nAs soon as I finished my simple meal, Master spoke up.\n\"Now that you've come to your senses, return to the Hall of the Demonic Way and focus on your training. Never forget this old man's advice.\"\nHe told me to avoid sword training as much as possible and focus only on external and internal energy cultivation.\nSoon after, warriors came to the medical wing.\nEscorted by the warriors, I wandered through the Tianshan Mountain Range for quite a while.\nBy the time the sunset began painting the sky, I was finally able to enter the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nThe gazes of my peers and juniors, who were training in the training ground, fixed on me.\nBut there was something oddly distant about it.\nThey only watched from afar.\nUnlike before, I didn't see any of them coming over to talk or challenging me to duels.\n‘Why?’\nAs I walked across the training ground and looked around, I made eye contact with some juniors who had been stealing glances at me, and I got a vague idea of why.\nThe way they looked at me was... how should I put it?\nTo use a modern-day analogy, it was like they were looking at some celebrity.\nOf course, it wasn’t as if that feeling was entirely absent before, but it felt much more intense now.\nIf before their eyes showed they wanted to get closer, now they looked like they didn't dare approach me at all. It was the look one gives to a person from an entirely different world.\nOn the other hand, my peers' reactions were subtly different.\nThey would glance at me briefly, then quickly turn away and immerse themselves in training.\nEvery single one of them was giving off this stern atmosphere like they were all battle-hardened veterans.\n‘Must've been quite a shock.’\nI couldn't speak for the juniors, but I understood my peers' feelings to some extent.\nNo matter how brutal the Hall of the Demonic Way's education was, it was definitely child's play compared to this recent battle.\n‘Those crazy fanatic bastards...’\nEven now, I could still hear their screams echoing in my ears like tinnitus.\nThose faces that kept laughing even while arrows and flames from our own allies pierced their backs, even while swords were stabbed into their guts.\nThough the term doesn't exist here, it wouldn't be strange if I'd developed post-traumatic stress disorder from that experience.\n‘I should have a talk with Physician Seo.’\nI was worried about my own condition, and it seemed unlikely that the rest of my peers were all right either.\nAs I was walking through the training ground, observing the faces of the disciples—\n\"Young Master!!\"\nSomeone called out cheerfully and came running over.\nIt was Ju Seo-yeon who had taken a scimitar to her side from the leader instead of me.\n\"How's your body holding up?\"\n\"Thanks to the Demonic Physician's best efforts in treating me, I was able to return to the Hall of the Demonic Way a few days ago.\"\nHearing her answer, a thought occurred to me.\n‘…If I was unconscious for longer than a person whose side was sliced open by Saber Qi, then just how serious was my condition?’\nI thought I was lucky to have been unconscious, but her next words stirred some ominous feelings.\n\"Oh, speaking of which, the Demonic Physician said something. He said that just as I saved you, Young Master, you also saved me.\"\n\"Ahem. I just fought that fanatic because I wanted to live.\"\n“Ah… that’s not what I was referring to. The Demonic Physician said that if you hadn't told him how to use some medicine, my treatment would have been nearly impossible.\"\n\"Medicine? What medicine?\"\n\"What was it... Ah! I think he called it narcotics. He said my condition was so serious that they had to operate while I was on narcotics. And he kept disinfecting the wound area with something called... disinfecting alcohol? He said both of those were treasures that you discovered, Young Master.\"\nIt seemed they could now perform surgeries that were previously almost impossible—the kind where nine out of ten patients would die on the table—with relative safety.\nBut I didn't have time to feel any satisfaction from that.\n‘That’s right. I did say it was okay to use narcotics on patients who might die. So wait, did they use them on me too? Was I unconscious for a month because I was high on drugs?’\nIt was unsettling in many ways, but I decided to let it slide for now.\n‘As long as there are no withdrawal symptoms, I guess it’s fine. They do prescribe narcotic painkillers to critical patients anyway.’\nWhen I organized my thoughts and looked ahead, Ju Seo-yeon was still chattering away while looking at me with an expression like a puppy..\nAnd I could easily figure out what she wanted.\n\"Don't worry. If Disciple Ju makes it into the Hidden Guard Pavilion, I'll definitely take you as my personal attendant.\"\n\"Thank you, Young Master!!\"\nShe wanted confirmation about the promise from back then.\nAnd I couldn't ignore the pure selfishness of someone who had been willing to throw away her life to save mine.\n‘Sorry, Miss Jin.’\nI offered a brief mental apology to clear away the faint guilt that remained.\nWith all her worries blown away, Ju Seo-yeon spoke with a bright face.\n\"Actually, while I was receiving treatment at headquarters, I even got to hear thanks from Miss Jin Hayeon thanks to you, Young Master!\"\n\"Hm? Miss Jin came to visit?\"\nI didn't even get to see her though?\n\"Yes. While the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons was handling business, she took some time away from caring for you to visit me.\"\nHmm. So she was nursing me while I was unconscious.\n‘That's actually a relief. If she went out of her way to express gratitude, they must have gotten pretty close, right...?’\nAs I organized this new information and looked ahead, Ju Seo-yeon's eyes sparkled as she spoke.\n\"Actually, I was so happy that I tried to get up and got my wound reopened, so I had to stay in the medical hall for a few more days. But that pain was nothing compared to the joy of hearing thanks from Miss Hayeon!\"\nHer expression was no less fervent than that of the fanatics we had just faced.\nAn expression not unlike those fanatics of Allah I'd encountered recently.\n‘…Sh-She’ll be fine, right?’\nSome inexplicable sense of dread crept up on me, but I decided to ignore it for now.\n\"Ahem. Even though I made a promise, you can't slack off in your training. Miss Jin might be disappointed.\"\n\"Yes, Young Master! I'll do my absolute best!\"\n\"Well then, I have places to visit, so keep it up.\"\nAfter spouting some well-meaning nonsense, I quickly walked away to escape from her.\nAnd the first place I headed to was the Hall Master's office.\n\"...Did you say the Supreme One summoned me?\"\n\"That's correct, Hall Master.\"\nTo get me exempted from the Hall of the Demonic Way's training schedule.\nI didn't bother stating that reason out loud.\nHall Master Yeom Ga-hwi was quite the old-fashioned hardass himself, so I had to leave it entirely to Master.\nOld-fashioned geezers should be dealt with by even bigger old-fashioned geezers above them. It would be hopeless for a young guy like me to handle one.\nNo matter what logic I presented, he'd inevitably reach the conclusion of \"How dare a young punk!\"\nAfter briefly reporting my return to the Hall of the Demonic Way and conveying Master's summons, I left the Hall Master's office and headed to the infirmary.\n\"Welcome! Young Master Il-mok!\"\nPhysician Seo Jae-pil welcomed me, but something felt off.\n\"Is something troubling you?\"\nHis face looked somewhat depressed.\nAt my question, Seo Jae-pil smiled bitterly and answered.\n\"It's because of this recent attack.\"\n\"Ah...\"\nBeing a psychiatrist, he must have realized that the disciples' mental states weren't good.\n‘Huh. But he's feeling sad about it rather than happy, so he's a more decent physician than I thought.’\nI naturally assumed he'd be celebrating having more patients to treat.\n\"There were so many seriously wounded from this incident that the medical wing performed major surgeries one after another. I heard that the revered Demonic Physician in particular conducted some truly fantastic and unconventional surgeries using the narcotics and disinfecting spirits you taught him about.”\n\"......\"\n“When I heard the story of how, by understanding the concept of ‘disinfection,’ they were able to sterilize a needle, attach it to a thread, stitch up Disciple Ju Seo-yeon’s damaged internal organs, and then reinforce it with qi… I nearly wept tears of blood, Young Master. I could not bear the fact that I was stuck in this Hall of the Demonic Way and could not witness a sight akin to the second coming of Hua Tuo.”\nYep, I was right about this guy.\nThis bastard was a madman obsessed with medicine.\nAfter that, Physician Seo continued babbling about various surgeries he hadn't witnessed firsthand but had only heard about through letters.\nHe did so with a face that looked like a man who had lost the woman he'd loved his whole life.\nIt was making my head spin.\nI felt that if I listened to this bastard’s story any longer, the side effect that my Master had suppressed would run wild, so I quickly opened my mouth.\n\"Stop. Stop right there.\"\n\"But Young Master, you've created new history that unfolded in the medical wing.\"\nI had no memory of creating any new history. Latest content publıshed on novel✶fire.net\nI had only ended up using drugs as painkillers when trying to stop this crazy bastard from using them as psychiatric medication.\nAnd I'd only thought of disinfecting alcohol while trying to solve my damn hygiene obsession.\n\"Sigh. That's all in the past now. More importantly, wasn't Physician Seo assigned to the Pure Mind Hall, not the medical wing? So focus more on what you should be doing. The disciples didn't just suffer physical injuries; their minds were wounded as well.\"\n\"???\"\nAs expected, Physician Seo looked like he hadn't thought of that at all.\n“For nearly all of them, it was their first real battle. And in that first battle, they were surrounded and ambushed by hundreds of enemies, witnessing blood-soaked combat with guts spilling everywhere right before their eyes. Furthermore, there were many casualties on our side, and countless cases where they themselves were injured. After going through something like this, how could they not be in shock?”\nI explained at length, but Seo Jae-pil still looked like he didn't understand.\n\"Isn't that something you naturally experience when learning martial arts? It's common even among the unbelievers in the Central Plains, not just in our Divine Cult, Young Master.\"\n\"......\"\nCome to think of it, this guy was a physician, but he was a Demonic Cult physician.\nThough he was studying mental illness due to the side effects of Demonic Arts, he was still one of those crazy bastards who took killing and being killed for granted.\nAs I pondered how to deal with this lunatic, I sighed softly and spoke calmly.\n\"As Physician Seo says, it is something they'll eventually experience. But the problem is that they experienced it too early and too intensely.\"\n\"???\"\n\"It's a simple principle. Humans are said to be creatures of adaptation, but they only adapt to things they can endure. What would happen if someone who had never trained in external arts in their entire life suddenly tried to lift a hundred-pound iron weight?\"\n\"Well, their muscles would tear and they'd live as a cripple for life, wouldn't they?\"\n\"The mind works the same way.\"\n\"Ah!!\"\nOnly then did Physician Seo grasp my intent.\nThey were no longer the dead-fish eyes from a moment ago.\n\"So you're saying that the minds of disciples who received too strong a stimulus this time might be damaged. Like how muscles can tear and cause permanent disability from excessive training.\"\n\"Exactly.\"\n\"However, this kind of thing is quite common in our Demonic Cult. But everyone lives normally, don't they?\"\n\"......\"\nI wanted to ask if the Demonic Cult bastards really looked normal to him, but I held back.\nHe'd probably think they looked normal anyway.\n\"Some people are naturally strong enough to handle heavy weights from the start, or only suffer minor injuries. The mind is the same. Some exceptionally strong individuals might endure it, but plenty will be broken by this incident. And unlike muscles, mental damage isn't visible, so it's hard to notice.\"\n\"You're saying the same experience can affect people differently. Haha. You truly are remarkable, Young Master. To think of comparing the human mind to muscles.\"\nSeo Jae-pil excitedly scribbled something on paper with interest, then looked up with shining eyes.\n\"Hmm. Come to think of it, since the disciples are already suffering from the side effects of Demonic Arts, the danger would be even greater if their minds are damaged.\"\n“That is precisely the point I was trying to make.”\n\"Hahaha. This definitely seems like a research topic worth pursuing, Young Master! I really made the right choice following you around!\"\n\"......\"\nA shiver instinctively ran down my spine as the madman spouted such stalker-like lines with gleaming eyes.\nBy the time I left the infirmary, the sky had already turned dark.\nI went to the cafeteria to get some patient food, then returned to the Black Dragon Pavilion to rest for a bit. It wasn't until late evening that I slowly got up and left my room.\nBy now, Jeong Hyeon should have returned to her room.\nAfter crossing the corridor of the Black Dragon Pavilion and passing several rooms, I arrived at the door with a familiar disciple's nameplate and carefully spoke up.\n\"Disciple Jeong. Are you there?\"",

    "content": "Chapter 173: Extremity (3)\nIl-mok's voice echoed through the quiet corridor, and after a brief moment...\nCreak.\nThe door opened, and Jeong Hyeon stepped out to greet Il-mok.\nIl-mok looked at her with surprise written all over his face. He hadn't expected her to open the door herself and step forward like that.\nThanks to her bold move, the distance between them was barely a single step.\nThat was not to say Jeong Hyeon had achieved the state of Transcendence.\nEven in the darkness of night, he could see her body trembling like a leaf.\n\"Sorry about that.\"\nWhen Il-mok considerately stepped back to give her space, Jeong Hyeon took deep breaths to slowly calm herself down.\nAfter staring her for a moment, Il-mok explained why he'd come looking for her in the middle of the night.\n\"Actually, I came to thank you. My memory's a bit hazy, but I think I saw an arrow fly toward that bastard at the end.\"\nIf Jeong Hyeon's arrow hadn't targeted that leader at the crucial moment, Il-mok would've been the one who died instead.\nThe reason he'd come at such a late hour was simple.\nDuring the afternoon, Jeong Hyeon would be at the training grounds with her club activities, and in the evening, there'd be plenty of disciples moving around inside the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nConsidering her tendency to avoid attention, he'd deliberately chosen a time when hardly anyone would be around.\nJeong Hyeon took several deep breaths before speaking. \"Young Master, do you remember what you told me about my future last time?\"\nIt was an odd response to his thanks, so Il-mok searched his memory before answering.\n\"I remember.\"\nBack then, Il-mok had suggested she might consider taking on assassination and espionage missions with the Dark Shadow Pavilion, or secretly guarding someone from the shadows.\n\"I'm thinking of joining the Hidden Guard Pavilion after I graduate from the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\n\"The Hidden Guard Pavilion?\"\nAs Il-mok tilted his head at this sudden topic, Jeong Hyeon continued.\n\"That's right. I want to become someone who protects you from the shadows going forward. So you really don't need to thank me.\"\nAbout a month ago, on the evening when the fanatics had attacked.\nA tense atmosphere hung over the main headquarters of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nIt’s because rather than returning to the Hall of the Demonic Way as tradition dictated, the disciples of the Demonic Way were brought to the main headquarters instead.\nIt wasn't simply because Il-mok was in critical condition.\nDespite the Black Tiger Corps, instructors, and teaching assistants fighting tooth and nail to protect the disciples, half of them had suffered serious injuries.\nFurthermore, since the other half were all lightly injured, they had headed to the main headquarters instead of returning to their place.\nRight now, at the medical wing.\n\"Get more disinfectant alcohol prepared right now!!\"\n“Hurry up and wash those clothes!! We managed to save them with surgery, do you intend to let them die of infection?!”\n\"DemonicPhysician! We're running low on medicinal ingredients!\"\n\"Then get some warriors and have them gather more! Comb through the Tianshan Mountain Range like you're hunting for fleas, get me those medicinal herbs right now!”\nThe place was an absolute battlefield.\nThe critically injured weren't just the disciples. There were many among the assistant instructors, instructors, and Black Tiger Corps members who had thrown their bodies on the line to fight and protect them.\nIn one corner of the medical wing, which resembled a warzone in its frantic atmosphere, there was a group giving off a distinctly gloomy vibe.\nThese were the disciples classified as lightly wounded, resting after receiving basic treatment.\nEvery single one of them sat with their mouths shut, either staring into space or hanging their heads low.\nThe experience of hundreds of fanatics trying to kill them with complete disregard for their own lives had left deep psychological scars that couldn't be easily healed.\nOne in particular rested alone among these lightly wounded disciples, separated from the others.\nA female instructor, also classified as lightly wounded, approached that disciple but stopped at a certain distance. Updates are released by N()velFire.net\nThat was as close as this particular disciple would allow anyone to get.\n\"Disciple Jeong.\"\n\"...Instructor Eun Ryeo.\"\nJeong Hyeon, who had been resting with her head down, looked up at Eun Ryeo.\n\"What were you thinking so deeply about?\"\nEun Ryeo asked out of concern that Jeong Hyeon might be consumed by negative thoughts.\n“…I’ve been thinking that I really don't belong in a combat unit after all.\"\nHearing Jeong Hyeon’s reply, Eun Ryeo realized her worry hadn't been misplaced.\n\"What are you talking about? Everyone makes mistakes. Are you planning to give up everything just because you fell to a Heart Demon once?\"\nDespite being faced with Eun Ryeo's loving reprimand, Jeong Hyeon just shook her head.\n\"I simply realized clearly this time that the Ghostly Spirit Divine Bow I've learned doesn't suit group activities like those of combat units.\"\nEun Ryeo, who had been about to scold Jeong Hyeon for her negative words, paused mid-sentence.\nShe realized something belatedly.\nDespite the negative content of her words, Jeong Hyeon's eyes hadn't been consumed by darkness.\nInstead, they held a conviction.\n\"But I did realize what kind of work truly suits me, Instructor.\"\n\"And what would that be?\"\n\"Protecting someone important from the darkness, where no one can see.\"\nJeong Hyeon was remembering that moment.\nThe memories of saving allies who had been on the brink of death with arrows she'd shot.\nAmong all those memories, the moment burned into her mind like a brand was when Il-mok had faced off against the fanatics' leader.\nWhile brilliant stars clashed and intense explosions and energy waves rang out, her single arrow had saved Il-mok's life.\nIn the middle of that ugly, horrific battlefield where people killed and were killed, Jeong Hyeon had ridiculously felt an exhilaration she'd never experienced before.\nIt was the moment when she—who had always thought herself pathetic—had protected someone precious.\n\"...Well done.\"\nAt Jeong Hyeon's determined words, so different from her usual fragile demeanor, Eun Ryeo nodded seriously.\nWhile everyone else was being swept away by psychological trauma, Jeong Hyeon was actually thinking about the future.\nNo, perhaps her subconscious had led her this way to overcome that trauma.\nIf she kept wallowing in depressing thoughts, she might really fall into a serious Heart Demon and fall into Qi Deviation.\nA few days later, Eun Ryeo, Jeong Hyeon, and the other lightly wounded disciples returned to the Hall of the Demonic Way first.\nEven after returning to the Demonic Way, Jeong Hyeon did her best to make that determination a reality.\nShe spent each and every day engrossed in her training.\nThis moment was no different.\n'If I keep running away from the very person I want to protect, how can I ever guard him?'\nWhen Il-mok suddenly showed up in the middle of the night, even though she felt like she might have a panic attack, she forced herself to step forward, open the door, and approach him.\nBecause he was the person she had vowed to protect from now on.\n“In the future, I want to become a person who protects you from behind the shadows, Young Master. Therefore, you really do not need to thank me.”\nJeong Hyeon declared her ambitious goal with an assertiveness unlike her usual self.\nHer heart felt like it might explode and her breathing was getting rapid, but somehow she squeezed out the courage.\nSeeing Jeong Hyeon's uncharacteristically bold demeanor, Il-mok tilted his head and then frowned as he asked, \"Wait, did Disciple Ju Seo-yeon brainwash you or something?\"\nIl-mok figured that when people suddenly changed, it was either because they were about to die or because they'd been influenced by some crazy person around them.\nHaving received the Heavenly Demon’s summons, Yeom Ga-hwi arrived at the Heavenly Demon Palace.\n\"I pay my respects to the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons.\"\nAs Yeom Ga-hwi offered his profound respects, the Heavenly Demon opened his mouth.\n\"Rise. The reason I called the Hall Master today is that I have something to tell you regarding Il-mok.\"\n“Please give your command.”\n“Exclude Il-mok from the third field training that will be held soon.”\n\"!!\"\nAfter showing a surprised expression, Yeom Ga-hwi swallowed once and replied with a solemn face.\nHe was like a loyal subject risking his life to offer a word of earnest advice.\n\"If the Supreme One commands me to risk my life fighting the unbelievers, I will do so. However, this would shake the long-standing rules of our cult.\"\nYeom Ga-hwi now understood Il-mok's ridiculous talent very well.\nBut no matter how outstanding his talent might be, giving special treatment to Il-mok alone would be problematic.\n“I know well what you are trying to say, Hall Master Yeom. However, this decision is not solely for Il-mok’s sake.”\n\"???\"\nTo the puzzled Yeom Ga-hwi, the Heavenly Demon explained Il-mok's condition.\nHis understanding of the sword was already trying to break free from the Extremity stage, but his external and internal cultivation had yet to reach that level of enlightenment.\n\"His side effects from transcending Extremity are already severe. And now, with the balance between his mind and his body thrown off, how unstable do you think Il-mok's condition is?\"\n\"But...\"\n\"Hear me out to the end. If Il-mok goes on field training in that state and has an episode while wielding his sword, do you truly not know what might happen? Il-mok is already at a level similar to the Hall instructors. No. If he has another episode and swings his sword while ignoring his body's condition, even the instructors would find him difficult to stop.\"\nYeom Ga-hwi understood what the Heavenly Demon was getting at.\n\"Are you saying to exclude Disciple Il-mok to protect the other disciples?\"\n\"Exactly. In my view, Il-mok right now is no different from cracked porcelain.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon recalled the scene from their recent conversation when Il-mok had almost had an episode.\nThough he'd pushed back those side effects with the demonic energy of the Heavenly Demon Divine Arts, that effect wouldn't last forever.\n\"Until all those cracks are sealed, he must be handled carefully. Rather than thinking of him as a disciple, watch him with the mindset of monitoring an instructor.\"\nIf the Heavenly Demon had his way, he'd want to keep Il-mok by his side to monitor him and prevent any episodes rather than sending him back to the Hall.\nBut as the leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, which revered martial arts and was founded on Demonic Arts, he couldn't overprotect his own disciple.\nFrom the Heavenly Demon's perspective, just sending Il-mok back to the Hall was already a significant compromise.\nIt was what he had to do as the Heavenly Demon to set an example for the members of the Divine Cult.\nYeom Ga-hwi understood the Heavenly Demon's true feelings and bowed deeply.\n\"I will follow the Supreme One's will.\"\nSeeing the upright loyal retainer bend his principles, the Heavenly Demon smiled gently and added.\n\"And you know this as well, don't you? Second-year disciples go on field training to quickly integrate them into the cult's organizations after graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way. From that perspective, do you truly think Il-mok needs additional field training?\"\nAt that question, Yeom Ga-hwi had no choice but to remain silent.\nNearly a month had passed since Il-mok collapsed. Word of what happened during the attack spread throughout the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nParticularly those who had witnessed Il-mok fighting up close that day were universally praising him.\nIt wasn't just about his outstanding skill level.\nDespite being a disciple with almost no real combat experience, he was competent enough to read the flow of the battlefield.\nAnd beyond that, his bravery in facing the enemy leader alone while suffering serious injuries is unmatched.\n'...He wouldn't have trouble fulfilling his role even if he entered a combat unit or other organization as a newcomer. No, it would probably be better for him to enter at a Squad Leader level upon graduation.'\nRealizing the Heavenly Demon's judgment was correct, Yeom Ga-hwi pressed his head to the floor and cried out, \"Please punish this fool's ignorance!\"\nThe Heavenly Demon looked down at him with an unreadable expression before speaking in a grave tone.\n\"You can pay for that sin slowly from now on. Since Il-mok is in a dangerous state where he might have another episode at any time, your punishment is to monitor him so that he doesn't harm the other disciples and can safely graduate from the Hall.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon had successfully assigned Yeom Ga-hwi as Il-mok's dedicated caretaker.\nMeanwhile, the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master who was always guarding the Heavenly Demon at his side, had to do his best to manage his expression.\n'Young Master Il-mok's talent goes without saying, but I'm worried that the Supreme One seems to favor Young Master Il-mok too much.'\nThe Hidden Guard Pavilion Master knew the truth.\nThat everything had been planned.\nThe reason the Supreme One had taken the time to persuade Yeom Ga-hwi step by step, even though he could have simply forced the order to exempt Il-mok, was to make him take on the role of Il-mok’s caretaker.\nThe Hidden Guard Pavilion Master, who had been wondering why he cherished his youngest disciple so much, suddenly came to his senses.\n'How could this be? To have such a blasphemous thought without even realizing it! The Supreme One must have a profound reason for acting this way.’\nHe had almost fallen into doubt without realizing it.\n‘This too must be because of Young Master Il-mok! Perhaps Young Master Il-mok and the Supreme One have orchestrated this affair to test me.’\nA divine test, it seemed, was all a matter of perspective.\nOr rather, the level of one’s mental gymnastics.",

    "content": "Chapter 174: Extremity (4)\nThe day after I ran all sorts of tests on Jeong Hyeon to see if she had been brainwashed, I was able to confirm that my Master had kept his promise.\n“From now on, you’re on your own schedule, separate from the regular Hall of the Demonic Way curriculum.\"\nThat's what the Head Instructor Chu Il-hwan told me when he called me.\nWhile my fellow disciples followed the set schedule and received instruction from various teachers, I was given complete freedom to train on my own.\nIf this had been the old me, I would've loved this kind of freedom and probably would've found some corner to take a nice long nap.\nBut now?\n\"Inhale... exhale...\"\nInstead of lazing around, I was completely absorbed in my training.\nIt’s obvious, really.\n‘If I can stabilize my external and internal cultivation, I can break free from the Extremity stage.’\nA hope of escaping the side effects of this damn Demonic Art had finally appeared.\nI'm someone who dreams of a peaceful life. I'm not just some lazy bum who does nothing.\nIf I had been a worthless lazy bum, I never would've passed the civil service exam in the first place.\nSo yeah, I was a man who got things done when he had to. More specifically—\n‘Once I break free from the Extremity stage and weaken these side effects, life will be worth living again!’\nI preferred to work hard for a short period to get things over with and then rest comfortably.\nIt couldn't be helped.\nIf I had been born with a golden spoon and never had to worry about making a living even if I loafed around my whole life, I could have been the laziest man alive. But I was in a position where I had to at least figure out a way to survive.\n\"Inhale... exhale...\"\nAnd so, I was engrossed in training for a good while, dreaming of that brilliant future.\n‘Whether it’s work or training, it’s best to be efficient.’\nA good idea struck me, so I headed somewhere else.\nAnd at the place I went to...\n\"One more time!!\"\n“Concentrate more on your muscles!”\nA disgusting scene was unfolding.\nInstructor Cheok Il-so was flexing his muscles enthusiastically, demonstrating moves and shouting at the top of his lungs.\nMeanwhile, Dokgo Pae, Gwak Sul, and several other new disciples whose names and faces I barely knew were busy pumping iron.\nFlex. Flex.\nAll of them in what looked like underwear, showing off their bulging muscles.\nInstructor Cheok Il-so, who was in the middle of leading his Bodybuilding Club activities, was late to notice my presence but greeted me when he did.\n\"Disciple Il-mok! What brings you here?\"\nHe welcomed me cheerfully, and I forced an awkward smile as I replied.\n“Uh, I came to try and learn some methods for external training.\"\nI really didn't want to associate with these sweaty bastards.\nBut after training alone for a while, I'd realized something important.\n‘I've been way too lazy all this time.’\nBecause I'd slacked off for so long, I had no idea what I was doing.\nThe only time I'd seriously worked on external energy was before entering the Hall of the Demonic Way when Jin Hayeon was putting me through hell.\nSure, I could train using the methods Jin Hayeon taught me, but...\n‘Why would I use inefficient methods when there is a real expert here?’\nIf I want to train properly, I should choose the most effective approach.\nOnly by doing so could I quickly achieve a balance between my mind and body to transcend Extremity and suppress that damn side effect.\nThat's why I'd come to this sweat-stinking place that kept triggering my hygiene obsession.\n‘Even if it's disgusting, better to get through it quickly and be done with it.’\nOnce I escape the Extremity stage, happiness awaits.\nI had a similar mindset when I was preparing for the civil service exam. I believed that even if I suffered for two or three years, a peaceful future would await me as long as I passed the test.\nRegular hours, leaving work on time, a comfortable job with no fear of getting fired.\nOf course, it took less than a week to realize I'd been living in a false fantasy.\n‘But this is different!’\nPassing the civil service exam and recovering from a mental disorder are two completely different things.\nProbably.\n\"Hahahaha! You came to exactly the right place! Looks like you've finally realized the importance of external cultivation!\"\n(TL Note: In case you readers aren’t getting it yet, the external cultivation refers to building your body. Internal cultivation or internal alchemy if we are going to be precise, refers to the practise of accumulating internal energy within one’s Elixir Field or Dantian. External cultivation means training your body. If you watched an old school kung fu movie that featured the Shaolin Temple, you’ll encounter the monks practising this by thrusting their hands into sands or punching boulders. In short, going to the gym ala ancient times.)\nInstructor Cheok Il-so burst into cheerful laughter and approached to hug me, but I used subtle footwork to dodge his grasp.\n\"Ahem. I just realized I'm still lacking in external cultivation.\"\nAfter putting a suitable distance between myself and Instructor Cheok Il-so, I followed his demonstration and lifted the iron chunk up and down for a while.\n\"Disciple Il-mok! You won't be able to observe muscle movement properly like that! If you want, I can lend you my outfit!\"\nWhat Instructor Cheok Il-so proudly pointed to was a pair of shorts that looked like underwear.\n“Ahem. That’s all right, Instructor.”\nI graciously declined Instructor Cheok's generous offer.\nAfter following Instructor Cheok Il-so's demonstrations and focusing on external training for a while, I finally noticed something strange.\n‘Why is he being so quiet?’\nDokgo Pae wasn't talking to me. No, he wasn’t even sparing me a glance.\nSure, we had a deal about no more challenges, but this was the guy who used to stare at me like a dog that needed a walk to the park.\nWhile I should have been grateful that the madman had lost interest in me, I felt a strange sense of unease.\nWhen a crazy person stops acting crazy, it usually means they're preparing for something even crazier.\n‘But if I ask him about it, he might just challenge me to another duel.’\nAfter organizing my thoughts, I questioned his partner instead of asking Dokgo Pae directly.\nAnd that someone was Gwak Sul.\n\"You mean Disciple Dokgo Pae?\"\nHe gave me a strange look when I asked, pondered with a \"hmm,\" then answered.\n\"I think it's because of what happened last time.\"\n\"You mean those fanatic bastards?\"\n\"That's right. What you said to him when we were first surrounded seems to have been quite... stimulating for him.\"\nI frowned, not understanding.\nI remembered cursing out Dokgo Pae when he was spouting stupid shit.\nBut given that bastard's usual temperament, it didn't make sense for him to be acting so docile for that reason.\n\"That's weird, isn't it? Given Disciple Dokgo's personality, he should make even more noise looking for sparring matches to improve his skills.\"\n\"Hmm. I think you could understand it as him realizing that quality matters more than quantity.\"\nAfter thinking about what that could mean for a moment, I kind of got it.\n\"You're saying he felt the difference between sparring and real combat?\"\n“That is more or less correct. From what he mentioned in passing, he wants to reflect on that day's battle and improve himself rather than just sparring.\"\nAt Gwak Sul's answer, I glanced toward one corner of the training ground.\nDokgo Pae was there, slowly swinging his sword with an extremely serious expression.\n‘Something something diversity and hardship help people grow. Like that?’\nThough it had only been about a month since I’d last seen his face, he seemed to have matured by several years.\nWhile I was having these strange thoughts, Gwak Sul's voice reached me again.\n\"It's a bit different from Disciple Dokgo's case, but I also learned quite a lot from this incident. Actually, I wanted to thank you, Disciple Il-mok.\"\n\"Thank me? I don't remember doing anything special.\"\n\"Thanks to you, I realized which direction I need to head.\"\n\"???\"\nAs I tilted my head, Gwak Sul spoke with an expression that mirrored Dokgo Pae's.\n\"I'm thinking of dedicating myself more to studying Formations and strategy. Even if I don't fight on the front lines as a warrior of our cult, I gained confidence that I could be of great help as a strategist.\"\nDokgo Pae and Gwak Sul had these heavy expressions that didn't suit their seventeen-year-old faces. Dıscover more novels at novel~fire~net\n‘This is… I think this might be serious.’\nI should probably go see Physician Seo Jae-pil.\nGrowing up too fast isn't always a good thing.\n“How are things going with the matter I mentioned last time?”\nTo Il-mok’s question, Seo Jae-pil answered with an unusually serious expression.\n\"It was exactly as you said, Young Master. All the disciples seem to have been quite affected by this incident. Generally, they all seem to want to use this as an opportunity to grow, as befits the warriors of our great cult... but the reality of their inner state was a little different.”\nSeeming to struggle with how to express it, Seo Jae-pil fidgeted with his brush before continuing calmly.\n\"Rather than overcoming this experience, they showed a strong tendency to try to actively ignore it. It would be a relief if they were only trying to ignore it; it seems there are also students suffering from nightmares or occasionally seeing hallucinations.”\n“I knew it…”\nWhen Il-mok responded bitterly, Seo Jae-pil smiled gently quite unlike his usual mad scientist demeanor.\n\"Still, we discovered this important fact so early thanks to you, Young Master. I'll conduct counseling sessions with sincere dedication and monitor the disciples' conditions.\"\nSeo Jae-pil wasn't just thinking about this incident alone.\nSince the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult was a group that worshipped martial arts, bloody incidents were part of daily life.\nThis attack had simply been more serious than usual.\n\"Furthermore, given the atmosphere of our cult, it seems many cases were overlooked because people couldn't bring themselves to show their weakness. Won't there be others who suffered similar symptoms in the past, and more in the future? For their sake too, we need to properly treat and study this condition.\"\nHe was certain that the cases he experienced while treating the students this time would greatly help the Divine Cult in the future.\nIn fact, Seo Jae-pil had been meticulously documenting his counseling sessions with the disciples over the past few days following Il-mok's advice.\nThe only problem was...\n\"I'm trying to organize the case studies, but what should we call this condition?\"\nHe couldn't come up with a suitable name to simply describe these symptoms.\nSeo Jae-pil looked at Il-mok with anticipation.\nIl-mok had named several mental conditions and treatments before.\nIl-mok pondered the question.\n‘Hmm. PTSD stands for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, right? But \"stress\" is English, so how should I translate it?’\nIl-mok, who had been trying to recall the modern term, felt that it was too long and difficult, and decided to come up with a suitable new name.\n\"How about 'Heart Scars'?\"\n“A scar left on the mind and heart… It does not seem like a bad name, but…”\nSeo Jae-pil thought about the name Il-mok had defined, then seemed to realize something and his eyes lit up.\n\"Are you thinking of a name that covers not just combat or killing, but other cases too?\"\n\"Exactly. Something as minor as heartbreak, or being scammed by a friend could also leave deep psychological scars for some people, don’t they?\"\n“That means there must be that many more diverse cases, and the treatment methods will have to be just as diverse.”\nMore work was inevitable, but somehow Seo Jae-pil's eyes were sparkling.\nIt was exactly the kind of reaction you'd expect from someone obsessed with medicine and work.\nIt was also a look that Il-mok, who valued a balance between work and rest, could never sympathize with.\nAnd the prey that this workaholic had just bitten down on was none other than Il-mok himself.\n\"Come to think of it, weren't you also on that battlefield, Young Master?\"\n\"Well, yes.\"\n\"Then what about you, Young Master? Are you truly unaffected?”\nHe asked about Il-mok's psychology with clinical interest, and Il-mok calmly examined himself before answering.\n\"Honestly, I'm not sure myself. Whether it's because of defense mechanisms or my Demonic Art, I don't feel much about it. But I do feel a strange sense of disconnection from my own lack of reaction.\"\nBeing treated like a research subject by Seo Jae-pil was uncomfortable, but he did feel like he needed treatment himself.",

    "content": "Chapter 175: Extremity (5)\nA few days later.\nIl-mok’s peers, along with the assistant instructors and instructors, departed from the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nAccording to the original schedule, they were heading out for their third field training.\nThis training happened just forty-odd days after that shocking battle from last time.\nThere was a risk that the students' mental state might deteriorate, but thankfully, the place they were heading to this time was the main headquarters.\nSince they'd already completed two training sessions with the armed forces, their practical training this time would be conducted at the headquarters' institutions.\nSpecifically, at the Sacred Order and the Law Enforcement Hall.\nWhen the Hall of the Demonic Way students arrived at the main headquarters, they split into two large groups. One head to the Sacred Order and the other to the Law Enforcement Hall.\nThey would alternate between the two for half a month each, spending a total of one-month training at both the Sacred Order and Law Enforcement Hall.\nSince it was their first day, the students received brief explanations about the work handled by either the Sacred Order or Law Enforcement Hall, were shown to their lodgings for rest, and then began their training.\nAround that time, one of the Law Enforcement warriors secretly approached the instructors and sent a telepathic message to Xiao Hong.\nXiao Hong nodded lightly with an expression that showed she'd heard nothing, then quietly slipped away to head somewhere.\nThe place she arrived at was the Chief’s office of the Law Enforcement Hall.\nEntering the building cautiously, she made a fist-and-palm salute to the old man sitting at a table to pay her respects.\n\"I greet the Chief.\"\n\"It's been a while, Deputy Commander Xiao.\"\nContrary to his welcoming words, the Chief's expression was ice cold even though they were meeting again for the first time since after more than half a year.\n\"Your reports have been quite sparse lately.\"\n\"There was a major incident at the Hall of the Demonic Way, so I didn't have the leisure to send letters.\"\n“And you expect me to accept that as an answer?” A stern aura emanated from the Chief.\nIn the past, Xiao Hong would have felt fear or experienced intense hunger from such an atmosphere.\nBut now, her expression remained completely unmoved.\n“It is precisely in such chaotic times that opportunities arise! You've served this Law Enforcement Hall for over ten years and don't even understand something so basic?!\"\nAt the angry Chief's reproach, Xiao Hong responded without any change in expression.\n\"Disciple Il-mok was bedridden in the medical wing until just a few days ago. Furthermore, after graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way, Disciple Il-mok is scheduled to take on a mission directly assigned by the Heavenly Demon. Even if I had sent separate letters, nothing would have changed.\"\nHer words were polite but completely devoid of emotion.\n\"This chaotic time is exactly the opportunity to change the mission the Heavenly Demon intended to assign! Since his beloved disciple nearly faced great danger, you could have persuaded him to join the Law Enforcement Hall instead of taking on a dangerous mission!\"\nXiao Hong recalled the appearance Il-mok had shown on the battlefield.\n\"The Eighth Young Master is not a weak man who would shy away from a dangerous mission.”\nAs Xiao Hong continued to give negative responses, the angry Chief's mood completely shifted.\n\"This won't work. That won't work. Are you really in a position to be saying such things?\"\nThe Chief's face had turned cold as he spoke. “Keep this up, and you will rot in the Hall of the Demonic Way for the rest of your life.”\nHearing that veiled threat, Xiao Hong recalled the events at the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nShe recalled how she had been sold off to the Hall of the Demonic Way for the strange rumor that the Eighth Young Master was a womanizer.\nAt first, she'd suffered quite a bit.\nShe'd had to attempt things she'd never done in her life in an effort to seduce the Young Master and she'd been tormented daily by the ominous feeling that her Chief might abandon her at any time. This caused her demonic energy to frequently threaten to go berserk.\nHowever, it was not like that anymore.\nBecause right now, even as her Chief threatened to abandon her, the demonic energy within her didn’t act up at all.\n\"How could I describe teaching the talents who will lead the Divine Cult in the future as 'rotting away'?\"\nAfter the recent attack, she had realized something.\nAt some point, she had truly become an 'instructor.'\nHer goal was no longer simply to drag the Eighth Young Master into the Law Enforcement Hall.\nIn the past, she would have followed the Chief like he was the sky itself.\nNow she offered him a final farewell.\n\"The next time we meet, I'd appreciate it if you called me Instructor Xiao rather than Deputy Commander Xiao.\"\nAgain, her words were polite, but her face showed no emotion as she clasped her hands in salute.\n\"…….\"\nIgnoring the murderous glare she felt from behind, she quickly left the building.\n'Phew.'\nA light sigh escaped her lips involuntarily.\nShe'd been thinking about this situation ever since they'd come out for training at the Law Enforcement Hall.\nSo while she'd spoken calmly, she couldn't help feeling an indescribable sense of pressure.\nNo matter what anyone said, the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall was one of the pillars supporting the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\n‘I did the right thing… right?’\nWalking with complicated feelings, she soon arrived at the building where the Hall of the Demonic Way students rested.\n\"Haaah!\"\nThe sight of a young student giving his all as he swung his sword caught her attention.\nIt was the student Xiao Hong had saved during the last attack.\nShe remembered how this student had come to thank her right after they'd escaped to the main headquarters.\n'Thank you, instructor! I'll definitely become an excellent warrior of the Divine Cult and prove that your kindness wasn't wasted!'\nWatching the student absorbed in training as if to fulfill that promise, a beautiful smile graced Xiao Hong's face.\nIl-mok continued his training even as his peers and instructors had departed for the field training,\nFor a good while, he swung the iron chunk according to the external arts training method he had learned from Instructor Cheok Il-so.\n\"Whew.\" Thɪs chapter is updatᴇd by Nove1Fire.net\nWhen his arms and legs started trembling, Il-mok headed straight to the Black Dragon Pavilion's bathhouse.\nAfter thoroughly washing himself, Il-mok returned to his room and immediately sat cross-legged.\nHe planned to focus on internal energy cultivation while his muscles recovered.\nHe'd considered starting breathing exercises right after working out, but his hygiene obsession made that impossible.\nIl-mok closed his eyes and began observing his internal state.\nWith a deep inhalation, he drew in his breath and awakened the energy that slumbered in his dantian.\nAfter wrapping the qi that had entered deep into his lungs with his internal energy, he guided it according to the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's principles. By the time he completed a Lesser Heavenly Circulation, the new qi that had entered his lungs had taken on the same color as his existing internal energy.\n\"Inhale. Exhale.\"\nAs he repeated his breathing and gathered energy a few more times, his now distinctly larger internal energy reserve filled his meridians and coursed through them.\nAfter finishing his qi absorption, Il-mok gradually gathered the internal energy running through his meridians into his dantian.\nThe dantian becomes full of internal energy at some point, with some still remaining in his meridians.\nIl-mok calmly observed the flow, gradually forcing the remaining internal energy circulating through his meridians into his dantian bit by bit.\nHe felt subtle pain from his already full dantian, but along with it, the size of his dantian slowly grew larger.\nThough he was simply sitting still and circulating his internal energy, large beads of sweat had already formed on Il-mok’s forehead.\n(TL Note: If you are confused, the Qi in the air is an unprocessed energy. Il-mok here took that energy into his body and processed it according to the martial principles of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword and refined it into his internal energy. Qi = Raw. Internal Energy (Neili if you are familiar with old-school Wuxia) = Processed energy. Neigong or Internal Art = The recipe for the cook.)\n\"Inhale. Exhale.\"\nOnce he stored all the gathered internal energy into his dantian, he repeated the process again.\nAnd so, he continued to expand the size of his dantian and his internal energy for a good while.\nAt some point, Il-mok's brow furrowed.\n—Swing your sword!\n—Relive the sensation from that day!\n—You must make that perfect strike your own!\nThe other ego that had been hiding after being scared by the Heavenly Demon's lion's roar slyly reared their ugly head right at this moment when he was absorbed in internal energy cultivation.\nIl-mok thought it had probably emerged precisely because this was a dangerous moment.\n'Shut up!'\nAs the side effects kept screaming at him to grab his sword and Il-mok fought against them internally, the demonic energy running through Il-mok's meridians naturally became turbulent.\nIl-mok's meridians twisted in various places, as his blood vessels bulged red and blue. Cold sweat began pouring down his entire body like a waterfall.\n'This fucking bastard, seriously.'\nIl-mok internally cursed at his other self's surprise attack.\nForcibly suppressing the demonic energy had its limit. At this rate, his meridians would burst and he'd either die or become a cripple.\nRealizing he had to swing his sword as the Demonic Arts demanded, he was about to get up when—\n'!?'\nHe felt someone's palm touching his back.\n'Of all times, now?'\nSomeone must be attempting an assassination following the Demonic Art's surprise attack.\nThat had to be it since someone's demonic energy was penetrating Il-mok's body through the palm touching his back.\nIl-mok tried somehow to drive out the enemy's newly appeared demonic energy, but the situation wasn't favorable as he couldn't even control his own rampaging demonic energy.\nHowever, the energy of the being he'd thought was an enemy moved completely differently from Il-mok's expectations.\nThat person's energy began selectively suppressing only the rampaging Demonic Arts' energy.\nThanks to this, Il-mok could operate his internal energy much more comfortably, and before long he succeeded in storing all the rampaging demonic energy in his dantian.\n\"Whew.\"\nIl-mok opened his eyes as he finished his breathing exercises with a deep breath.\nHe immediately got up and bowed toward the person who had saved him.\n\"I'm grateful for the Hall Master's kindness.\"\nThe one who had saved him was Yeom Ga-hwi.\n\"It's what I should do, so don't worry about it.\"\nYeom Ga-hwi, who had been made Il-mok’s babysitter by the Heavenly Demon, replied with a stoic expression.\nHe didn't mention that he'd been hiding and monitoring Il-mok for several days already due to the Heavenly Demon's orders.\nIt was because he thought that if Il-mok were to notice that he was being protected, he might lose his sense of vigilance.\nBut Yeom Ga-hwi's consideration was somewhat meaningless.\nIt wasn't because he'd already heard from the Heavenly Demon that Yeom Ga-hwi had been assigned as his guardian.\nIt was a few days ago, the first time he went berserk.\n\"Inhale. Exhale.\"\nHe had been lifting the iron weights after learning from Instructor Cheok Il-so.\n—The end of all martial arts leads to one path.\n—Why do you think you can't perform the sword techniques you executed with bare hands with this?\n—Come! Let's display that day's sword technique once more!\nSuddenly, the crazy bastard started mistaking the iron weight in his hand for a sword.\nAs Il-mok argued with the mad Demonic Art and began his quarrel to control his body, he suddenly trembled.\nSoon, his blood vessels bulged as if they'd burst through his skin and took on a reddish-blue color. Cold sweat also poured down Il-mok's body.\nThe moment Il-mok finally couldn't bear it and swung the iron weight according to the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's technique —\nThwack!\nYeom Ga-hwi instantly closed the distance with his incredible lightness skill and struck Il-mok’s abdomen with a single fist.\n\"Ugh…\"\nWhile Il-mok let out a weak groan as his breath was momentarily knocked out of him, Yeom Ga-hwi’s hands moved quickly to suppress Il-mok's meridians.\n\"Sit cross-legged and focus on your internal energy!\"\nAs if he had no concern for Il-mok’s details whatsoever, Yeom Ga-hwi once again placed his palm on Il-mok’s back and began to suppress his Demonic Art.\nFrom that day forward, Il-mok went into rampage almost every other day.\nHe'd rampage while circulating his internal energy, swinging iron weights, or even just eating in the dining hall.\nThe last one was because the damn bastard mistook the chopstick as a sword and tried to unleash the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword using it.\nAfter subduing the rampaging Il-mok once again, Yeom Ga-hwi wiped away sweat that had flowed down without him realizing it.\n'The Heavenly Demon did warn me, but I never imagined it would be this severe.'\nHe'd been told that Il-mok was in a precarious state, but Yeom Ga-hwi hadn't expected him to rampage this frequently.\n‘…If I had let him move together with the other students, something truly terrible might have happened.’ Yeom Ga-hwi’s admiration for the Heavenly Demon increased by the day with each of Il-mok’s rampages.\nAnd so continued to immerse himself in his training.\nEven while his other self caused rampages constantly, Il-mok remained unshaken.\nNo, he was actually focusing on training out of spite.\n‘This son of a bitch. You’re scared of my Master, and you think I’m an easy target, is that it?’\nThe guy who had crumpled at one roar from his Master and stayed quiet for over ten days was now having fits almost every other day.\nSince the bastard was so irritating, Il-mok fuelled his training with almost pure spite.\nUsually, when a crazy person keeps coming around, people avoid them out of fear.\nBut for Il-mok, this was somewhat familiar territory.\n'I've dealt with even worse difficult sons of bitches than you, you bastard.'\nHe'd even dealt with people who came not just every other day, but actually showed up with knives to cause trouble, so this wasn't anything special.\nAnd so time flowed on.\nWhile his classmates went out for training and returned, Il-mok simply kept fighting his Demonic Art while upgrading his body.\nAfter several months had passed like this and gradual changes began to appear.\nThe frequency of his fits was noticeably decreasing.\nThe Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword still threw its daily tantrums, but Il-mok was beginning to overcome those fits little by little.\nSeveral more months passed like this, and on a day when the Hall of the Demonic Way graduation ceremony wasn't far off—\n\"Whew.\"\nIl-mok, who had been circulating his internal energy, opened his eyes with a deep sigh.\nAfter pondering for a moment, Il-mok picked up a sword that was sitting alone in one corner of the training ground.\n\"Whew.\"\nAs if trying to shake off his tension, Il-mok lightly controlled his breathing and began to perform a sword dance.\nStarting with the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword's first technique, Soul-Departing Sword, Il-mok then performed all fourteen techniques, followed up by performing all eight secret techniques.\nRight after performing all the forms, Il-mok's eyes changed.\nIt was not a look stained by madness. The tension that had resided in his eyes was replaced with conviction.\nIl-mok moved boldly.\nThe enlightenment gained during these two years at the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nThe teachings he'd learned from Elder Kang at Peach Blossom Ridge, the insights he'd gained from clashing with instructors. And the true meaning of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword he'd grasped while fighting the fanatics' leader last time.\nHe began displaying all of it.\nIn a single swing, countless principles are mixed together in harmonies.\nWhereas before this action would have made his muscles, bones, and meridians scream, now only a slight stiffness remained.\nFar from being painful, he even felt refreshed.\nAnd so, he danced drunk on the sword for quite a while like this.\n\"Whew.\"\nHis internal energy depleted and he lowered his sword with a deep breath.\nA smile had naturally appeared on Il-mok's lips.\nJust one step.\nThat was the distance Il-mok had moved past from Extremity.",

    "novel_title": "So, Did Someone Force You to Become the Heavenly Demon",
    "chapter_number": "Chapter 176",
    "content": "Chapter 176: Career Path (1)\nA few months ago, around the time when Il-mok was engrossed solely in his solitary training.\nIl-mok’s peers were also in the process of overcoming the memory of that day in their own ways.\nBut not all the disciples were handling things well.\nSince the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult was a group that venerated the martial way, fearing battle was an unacceptable notion.\nMost of the disciples desperately tried to ignore the fact that they'd felt fear, which only worsened their symptoms.\nAnd Physician Seo Jae-pil, who'd received special orders from Il-mok, was busting his ass trying to save them.\n\"It's okay not to force yourself to ignore your fear. Being unable to feel fear is just plain ignorance. Knowing you're scared but still standing up to fight is what real courage is.”\nHe gave those desperately trying to push away their fear the courage to face their own emotions.\nObviously, a few words wouldn't magically fix all the disciples and help them overcome that day's trauma.\n“It seems there are several students whose condition is more serious than I thought, Young Master.”\n\"Ugh. I'm in pretty serious condition myself.\"\nIl-mok, who was still in the middle of his episodes at the time, let out a deep sigh and started venting.\n\"This damn bastard keeps acting up in my head.\"\nActually, there were several reasons Il-mok could endure despite having breakdowns day after day.\nThe rage that built up from being tormented by these shitty side effects. The hope that the side effects would weaken once this period passed. The nanny who appeared to save him every time he had a fit. And finally, the regular counseling he had with Seo Jae-pil made him stay sane.\nWhen you're pissed off or depressed, just spilling your grievance to someone tends to ease the burden a bit.\nOf course, there were also cases where misspeaking could spread rumors and cause more tiring troubles, but Seo Jae-pil was basically a psychiatrist, so he was a relatively safe partner for conversation.\n\"This crazy bastard can't even tell the difference between a sword and chopsticks anymore. I was just trying to pick up some meat with chopsticks, but suddenly he tried to unleash the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword’s technique as if trying to slaughter the meat!”\nSince the 'crazy bastard' he was referring to was another personality, it was basically the same as calling himself a crazy bastard.\nBut Seo Jae-pil didn't bother pointing that out.\n\"I'm gonna completely slaughter him with the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\"\nHe also didn’t point out how insane the vow to slaughter himself sounded, or how bizarre it was to say he would kill the ego of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword with the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword itself.\nHe just thought, \"The Young Master must be having a very hard time lately,\" and moved on to jot everything down on paper for the sake of future research purposes.\nOnce Il-mok’s seemingly never-ending rants finally stopped, Seo Jae-pil asked what he really wanted to know.\n\"What should we do about these poor disciples?\"\nHe knew from the start that Il-mok just wanted to vent, not actually find solutions.\nHence, it was better to steer his thoughts in a different direction.\nTo that question, Il-mok responded with a half-hearted attitude.\n\"They're all members of our cult anyway, right? Maybe we could use their faith to help?\"\nIt sounded pretty blasphemous, but Seo Jae-pil decided to hear him out.\n\"Using their faith... In what way do you mean?”\n\"Tell them to confess their sins to Master. From our cult members' perspective, Master is basically no different from a god. If they confess their sins to Master and receive forgiveness, wouldn't that alone make their hearts feel much lighter?\"\nPeople turning to god when pushed to their limits.\nIt was a common story.\nWhether they be athletes or celebrities, exam-takers or businessmen, weren't there countless people who came to believe in a religion after overcoming a difficult time?\nReligion is tremendously valuable because it can provide the driving force to get through hard times.\nThat's what Il-mok used to think.\nUntil he had entered this crazy cult.\nAnd Seo Jae-pil, a cult member obsessed with medicine, opened his mouth with a troubled expression.\n“Th-That… To use the Supreme One for such a personal reason, wouldn’t that be extremely disrespectful?”\nNo matter how obsessed he was with medicine, he was still a member of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nHe would never have dared to even imagine the thought of selling the Heavenly Demon’s name for the sake of his own treatment.\nBut Il-mok was different.\n\"Have you forgotten how benevolent Master is? Since these poor young disciples have been pushed to their mental limits, Master would embrace them with his vast magnanimity. This isn't exploiting Master's name for personal gain at all.\"\n\"Ah...\"\nSeeing that Seo Jae-pil had realized something, Il-mok kept talking.\n\"Plus, if they overcome their fear through Master's grace, their faith will deepen. And if they break free from their Heart Demons, their skills will also progress by leaps and bounds. In other words, they will be reborn as faithful warriors of the Divine Cult. What reason could Master possibly have to be displeased?\"\nSeo Jae-pil scribbled something down on paper with his brush with a face full of emotion.\nAs he organized these medical yet religious insights, he soon lifted his head and spoke. “In that case, are you also confessing to the Supreme One every night, Young Master?”\n“What the f—… Ah, sorry, my Demonic Art went crazy. What's with that random question?\"\n\"Since you said praying to the Supreme Being brings peace of mind, I wondered if you, who've been having daily episodes lately, might also be doing the same.\"\nIl-mok forced his lips up into the most strained smile possible as he answered, \"Of course I am.\"\nFar from confessing to Master, he cursed him out in his head every other day.\nEven now, his daily journal was packed with insults about the Heavenly Demon.\nIt was natural.\n'Motherfucker. Why the hell did you have to teach me this piece of shit Demonic Art?'\n— Snatch that man’s brush!\n— Show me that most perfect sword technique once more!\nEven at this very moment, the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword was having a fit in his head.\nThe next day.\nSeo Jae-pil smiled gently at a disciple he'd been counseling for months and gave his advice.\n\"Tonight, before you sleep, clasp your hands together and confess your sins to the Heavenly Demon. You are a frail mortal being under the Heavenly Demon’s care, and at the same time, you are a warrior who will fight for the Divine Cult in the future. If it's the benevolent Heavenly Demon, he will hear your confession and forgive your sins. And through the Supreme One's grace, you will be reborn as a faithful warrior.\"\nFollowing Il-mok's advice, he gladly sold out the Heavenly Demon.\nAnd not just to one person.\nHe gave the exact same advice to all the students who were showing similar symptoms.\nAnd the effect was beyond imagination.\nA few days later, students began to offer prayers to the Heavenly Demon according to Seo Jae-pil’s advice.\n\"Ah, so that's how it was.\"\n\"Fear is only natural for us mere mortals.\"\n\"But with the Supreme Being by our side.\"\n\"He embraces all our fears and sins.\"\nThe disciples, each having their own revelations, started reciting prayers with \"The Heavenly Demon Descends to Save All Demons!\" whenever even slightly negative thoughts arose.\nWhenever Il-mok caught glimpses of his peers being like that during his training, he’d think, '...Their eyes look similar to those fanatic bastards I saw last time, don't they?'\nExcellent fanatics were being cultivated in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nThanks to his advice.\nAround the time Il-mok's episodes were gradually becoming less frequent, most of his peers were also slowly beginning to escape from that day's nightmare.\nAs the wounds carved into their hearts gradually healed and they found the strength to move forward, the disciples each painted their own futures in their own ways.\nThere were those like Dokgo Pae who refined their own martial arts by reviewing the battle of that day, and there were those like Gwak Sul or Jeong Hyeon who set out to find their own unique paths.\nOf course, there were also those like Ju Seo-yeon who didn't seem particularly moved by anything.\nAnd one disciple was attempting a frontal breakthrough in a completely different way from the others.\nJust when everyone was finally breaking free from that day's wounds, this woman went to each disciple individually to propose 'a certain thing.'\nIt was an absolutely ridiculous proposal, and several disciples reacted negatively to it.\n\"Hohoho. Just trust me and follow along.\"\n\"There's no need to be afraid. My outstanding looks and acting will draw all the attention anyway.\"\nFrom the start, the possibility of her proposal being rejected was unthinkable to this woman.\nShe eventually persuaded—or rather, forcibly recruited—all her classmates except Il-mok and then moved on to her next task.\nAfter dragging in all her classmates except Il-mok, she felt it was a bit lacking to proceed with just nineteen people.\nShe ended up convincing even the assistant instructors and instructors, and even dragged in the junior disciples almost by force.\nThe work progressed smoothly, and time flew by quickly.\nAnd a few days after Il-mok took a step away from Extremity\nOn the day of the Hall of the Demonic Way’s graduation ceremony..\n\"As the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons, I offer my sincere congratulations to you, the talents who will be responsible for our Divine Cult's future, on completing your studies at the Hall of the Demonic Way.”\n“It would be well for you to take pride in the countless hardships and adversities you have experienced over the past two years. In particular, there were an exceptional number of eventful incidents this year, so this Hall Master is also very proud of you for overcoming all of those adversities.”\nThe Heavenly Demon and the Hall Master droned on with congratulatory speeches similar to last time.\nIl-mok felt like his barely overcome Heart Demon might resurface from that tedious speech.\n— Cut off both their heads with your sword right now! You can unleash that perfect sword technique now!\n'You crazy bastard. That wouldn’t even work on those two.’\nPerhaps because his focus on training had paid off, Il-mok could easily resist his other ego's temptation.\n— Ahem. L-let's build up a bit more skill before challenging them.\nMaybe it just got scared of the Heavenly Demon and tucked its tail between its legs.\nAnd after all the congratulatory speeches ended.\nIl-mok came to witness with his own two eyes the plan of a certain crazy woman that had been carried out without his knowledge.\n\"This graduation ceremony performance will be conducted as a joint performance by all clubs!\"\nIl-mok, who had lived focused only on training, was puzzled when he heard Head Instructor Chu Il-hwan's announcement.\n'Joint performance? Was there such a thing?'\nAnd Il-mok's confused expression soon twisted bizarrely.\nIn the center of the training ground were his nineteen classmate surrounded by their juniors.\nIt was when he heard that specific battle cry did he finally realized what kind of joint performance this was.\n\"Allahu Akbar!!!\" ᴛhis chapter is ᴜpdated by novel·fire.net\nThe play that Bang Mi-hwa had prepared was none other than a reenactment of the battle of that day.\nThe juniors, assistant instructors, and instructors played the roles of those fanatics from that day.\n\"Hyaah!\"\nAnd the students who had been ambushed that day were each expressing their own selves from that day.\nExcept for one person.\n\"Disciple Gwak Sul! Keep giving orders!\"\nThe protagonist of the play, Bang Mi-hwa.",

    "content": "Chapter 177: Career Path (2)\nThis entire performance had been planned and orchestrated by her.\nThe reason the instructors at the Hall of the Demonic Way and even Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi had readily accepted the plan was pretty straightforward.\n\"Hyah!\"\nIt served as proof that the disciples had overcome the trauma of that day.\nLiving up to the expectations of the instructors and Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi, the disciples faced those memories with unwavering eyes, even when the fanatics chanted the name of their god as they charged.\nClang!\n\"Hyah!\"\nThey displayed martial arts far more advanced than before, decisively cutting down the fanatics.\nDokgo Pae, whom Il-mok had once criticized as an idiot, had spent the past few months obsessing over his training. Now he was at the forefront, bravely defeating the cultists with his Dokgo Nine Swords that was several levels more refined than before.\n\"Hahaha! I am Dokgo Pae, eldest grandson of the Dokgo Family!\"\nEvery time he swung his massive sword with tremendous force, those playing the cultist roles had to frantically dodge or roll around on the ground.\nIt was only natural.\n'Damn it. I thought this was supposed to be acting.'\n'Why aren't you following the choreography, Senior Dokgo?!'\nDokgo Pae was getting so worked up that he started swinging his sword like it was a real fight.\nBut it wasn't just Dokgo Pae who stood out. The whole battle was playing out very differently from that day.\nThe disciple who'd been injured in the thigh and rescued by Xiao Hong was now fighting valiantly. Same with the disciple who'd barely survived thanks to a Black Tiger Corps member's protection.\nInstead of succumbing to Qi Deviation, Jeong Hyeon had been supporting allies with arrows using her Ghostly Spirit Divine Bow from the start of the battle.\nAnd Gwak Sul was calmly giving out orders.\nJu Seo-yeon, who'd been badly injured protecting Il-mok that day, was now bravely fighting off cultists instead of playing bodyguard.\nIt was completely different from what actually happened, but nobody cared about that.\nThis play was meant to celebrate everyone breaking free from the nightmare. To commemorate their true victory in that war.\n\"Hahaha! How pathetic! You heathen leader!\"\nThe one spouting the most unrealistic dialogue was, obviously, Bang Mi-hwa, playing the role of Il-mok.\nFor her, none of the higher-ups' interpretations mattered.\nSure, the higher-ups may have understood this as some kind of religious or progressive event, but...\n'As the second President of the Theater Club, I have zero intention of following the legacy left by the first!’\nThe truth was, she'd organized this performance for purely personal reasons.\nLast year's play had been Baek Cheon's creation, so repeating that would've made him the star instead of her.\nFollowing the choreographed sequence, she clashed weapons with Chu Il-hwan, who played the enemy’s leader.\nLike a proper protagonist, her sword sliced across Chu Il-hwan's throat.\n\"Urgh...\"\nThe moment the leader groaned and collapsed, she boldly declared.\n\"Hahaha! How dare these heathens covet the Divine Cult's territory! I, Il-mok, the Eighth Disciple of the Supreme One, will exterminate all of you!!\"\nThat must've been the final line since the fanatics suddenly were sprawled on the ground,\nThe only ones left standing were Il-mok's classmates.\nUnlike when they'd barely survived that actual battle, they all wore confident expressions.\nAll except one person.\nIl-mok himself—the real protagonist who'd been relegated to audience member—was blushing furiously.\n'Please, just dig a grave for me.'\nThe Qi Deviation he'd barely escaped felt like it was creeping back.\nAfter the flashy graduation ceremony ended, Il-mok left the Hall of the Demonic Way with his classmates and headed for the main headquarters.\n\"Where are you planning to go?\"\n\"Wouldn't the combat unit be the best choice?”\n\"Hmm. I'm thinking the same thing. How about we try to get into the same unit?\"\nHaving graduated from the Hall of the Demonic Way, they could now proudly call themselves the rising generation of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. They chatted about their future paths as they walked.\nJu Seo-yeon, who'd lived solely with the dream of joining the Hidden Guard Pavilion to become Il-mok's personal attendant, was excited about finally becoming someone's junior.\nJeong Hyeon, who'd also resolved to become Il-mok's personal guard like Ju Seo-yeon followed behind him with a somewhat flushed expression. Others couldn’t see it as she had her head lowered in shyness.\nThough Il-mok wasn't joining the group conversation, he seemed to be in a pretty good mood.\n'Finally. Finally, I'm free!'\nHe hadn't been this happy even when he'd passed the civil service exam and ended his test-prep life.\nThe day of his life in this mental asylum for prospective mental patients had finally over. He could honestly say it had been tougher than studying for government exams.\nOf course, his classmates who'd successfully graduated from the mental asylum were no longer prospective mental patients. They'd magnificently become full-blown mental patients, but that didn't matter to Il-mok.\n'No more getting tangled up with them!'\nNeither with these peers, nor with the lunatics swarming the main headquarters. He would never have to see them again as long as things went according to his plan.\nThat's when Dokgo Pae stepped boldly in front of Il-mok.\n\"Young Master Il-mok. I'm planning to seek out the Black Tiger Corps today. Since two Black Tiger Corps seniors died protecting us six months ago, I'll fill their positions, build my strength, and someday become the head of my Dokgo Family.\"\nIl-mok was puzzled.\nHe couldn't figure out why the guy was telling him what sounded like a personal resolution.\nBut today was a good day, so Il-mok was happy to humor the nonsense.\n“I wish you the best of luck.”\nHe tried to leave after offering encouragement, but as expected of Dokgo Pae, he blocked his path again.\n\"And someday I'll compete with you for the position of Cult Leader! So, as a worthy rival and competitor, can you tell me? Young Master Il-mok, what do you plan to do for our Divine Cult from now on?\"\nSo he'd blocked the way because he was curious about Il-mok's career path.\n\"Hmm. If what you plan to do would truly benefit the Divine Cult, I'll join you instead of joining the Black Tiger Corps.\" Googlᴇ search Nov3lFɪre.ɴet\nThe moment his question ended, all the other disciples' gazes focused on Il-mok.\nThey couldn't help but be curious.\nIl-mok had already told the Black Tiger Corps Leader and White Sparrow Corps Leader that after graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way, he'd be carrying out a solemn mission from the Heavenly Demon.\nFor the young rising generation, it was a story that could not fail to stir their curiosity. They just hadn't dared ask directly.\nAnd Il-mok, now the center of everyone's attention, answered, \"I'll only know the specifics after discussing it with Master.\"\nEven though no such mission from his Master existed, his expression was remarkably confident.\n\"Hmm. Then, after you have spoken with the Supreme One, please let me know discreetly. I'll wait a few days without joining the Black Tiger Corps until you call for me.\"\nAt Dokgo Pae's offer of kindness, Il-mok nodded.\n\"I'll do that.\"\nNaturally, he had absolutely no intention of contacting him.\nAfter passing through the forest path and reaching the main headquarters entrance, the rising generation who'd graduated from the Hall of the Demonic Way scattered in different directions.\n\"How far are you planning to follow me?\"\nAt Il-mok's question, Ju Seo-yeon and Jeong Hyeon, who'd been happily following him, hesitated.\n\"Well, since I'm your attendant now, shouldn't I follow you?\"\nAt Ju Seo-yeon's innocent answer, Il-mok let out a small sigh.\n“Wouldn't the proper procedure be to first apply for admission to the Hidden Guard Pavilion, and then come find me after you passed their test?\"\n\"Ah...\"\n\"......\"\nSeeing the two women with foolish expressions on their faces, Il-mok let out another faint sigh.\n'Did Jeong Hyeon get infected by that airhead too...?'\nHer sudden oath to become his guard and various other things felt ominous.\nHe even wondered if she had been brainwashed by Ju Seo-yeon.\n\"Even if Master gives me a command, I'll stay at Windrock Palace for a while, so both of you should go to the Hidden Guard Pavilion first.”\n\"You absolutely cannot abandon me, Young Master!\"\n\"I-I understand.\"\nAfter bowing, they headed toward the Hidden Guard Pavilion.\nAfter shaking off those two tails, Il-mok headed straight for the Heavenly Demon Palace.\nAt the end of the graduation ceremony, there had been a telepathic message that snapped Il-mok out of his near-Qi Deviation.\n—Come find this old man first when you return to the headquarters.\nIt was a telepathic message from the Heavenly Demon.\nHis other self, which had been on the verge of throwing a tantrum, had retreated deep into his subconscious at that single transmission.\nUpon reaching the Heavenly Demon Palace, Il-mok immediately prostrated himself before his master.\n\"I greet the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons!\"\n“Hahaha. Rise.”\nIn the eyes of the gently laughing Heavenly Demon, an unconcealed emotion was contained.\nIt was pride.\n“Hahaha. I knew your talent was outstanding, but even this old man never predicted that you would start transcending Extremity so soon after completing your training at the Hall of the Demonic Way.”\nIt was unprecedented growth speed in the history of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. Even compared to himself, the current Heavenly Demon.\nAt the Heavenly Demon's lavish praise, Il-mok bowed his head modestly.\n\"It's all thanks to your teachings, Master.\"\n\"Hahahaha. You are painting gold on this old man's face.\"\nSeeing the Heavenly Demon so genuinely delighted, the Pavilion Master of the Hidden Guard Pavilion also felt a sense of novelty.\nHe had been at the Heavenly Demon’s side as the Pavilion Master for over ten years, yet this was the first time he had ever seen him look so delighted.\n\"I heard the story.\"\n\"...?\"\nAs Il-mok made a bewildered face at the out-of-the-blue remark, the Heavenly Demon elaborated.\n\"You told the Black Tiger Corps Leader and the White Sparrow Corps Leader that this old man had given you separate instructions?\"\nIl-mok almost flinched involuntarily.\n'Why are these guys so loose-lipped despite how they look?'\nHe never thought they'd go tattling to Master about that.\n“I-I apologize, Master.”\nHe had dared to use the Heavenly Demon's name for his own ends; he had no idea what kind of horrific punishment might befall him.\nIl-mok trembled with fear, but the Heavenly Demon still wore a pleased expression.\n\"Hehehe. Don't worry. This old man understands your intentions perfectly.\"\n\"???\"\n\"Instead of joining the combat unit, you made that excuse because you have something you absolutely want to do, right?\"\nApparently, the Heavenly Demon had some serious rose-colored glasses on.\n“So now, speak. This old man is also quite curious. What task do you wish to do for the good of the Divine Cult, so much so that you would go as far as invoking this old man's name?”\n\"......\"\nIl-mok gulped nervously.\n'This could be dangerous if I package it wrong.'\nIl-mok's goal had always been the same.\nEscape to the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult’s branch in the Central Plains.\nAs a regional branch, he'd be free from the Heavenly Demon and his senior brothers' interference, and there wouldn't be anyone with a higher rank than him.\nIf he could just get there, he could end this slave-like existence and enjoy freedom.\nOf course, Il-mok was already in the process of transcending Extremity. There was no longer a reason to avoid training or turn away from enlightenment using his mental illness as an excuse.\nFrom now on, the higher his realm, the more his mental condition would improve.\nBut even from that perspective, Il-mok concluded that a Central Plains branch would be better than headquarters.\n'If I stay here, I might get summoned by Master or my senior brother every day to play as their Wikipedia.'\nHe planned to enjoy peaceful training and relaxation at some quiet Central Plains branch.\nThe problem was that if he honestly revealed his true intentions, who knew what terrible punishment he'd face for using the Heavenly Demon's name for personal reasons.\nRealizing his life depended on his silver tongue, Il-mok's mind began spinning furiously.\nFortunately, he'd been thinking up justifications ever since deciding to go to the Central Plains.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 178",
    "content": "Chapter 178: Career Path (3)\nAbout a year ago.\nYueyang in the Central Plains.\nA massive estate stood at the heart of this beautiful scenic spot overlooking Dongting Lake—a place that countless poets had praised since ancient times.\n[Murim Alliance]\nWritten in bold, dragon-like calligraphy, the plaque hung above the estate.\nIn one section of this compound, a man dressed entirely in black entered the Flying Dragon Pavilion.\nThe black-clad figure quickly made his way to the deepest part of the Flying Dragon Pavilion. As soon as he opened the door and stepped inside, he clasped his hands and bowed respectfully.\n\"I greet the Pavilion Lord.\"\nThe man addressed as Pavilion Lord nodded coldly and asked, \"Any special intelligence on those zealots?\"\nThe Murim Alliance was founded by the various sects of the Central Plains joining hands.\nThey had gathered under the noble cause of protecting the peace of the Central Plains, and naturally, there were various forces that harbored hostility toward them.\nBut since the powers that held considerable influence throughout the Central Plains had united their strength, there weren't many forces that could actually threaten them.\nThe Flying Dragon Pavilion's main mission was to monitor such threatening forces and prevent the emergence of new enemies in advance.\nAnd the man who had just come to see the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord was a highly capable subordinate who oversaw surveillance of the most dangerous among those few remaining forces.\nIn truth, while the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord maintained his usual cold expression, his mind was far from at ease.\n'What the hell are those fanatics plotting? I can't figure it out.'\nAll this chaos had started because of the intelligence that very capable subordinate brought. More precisely, it was because of information that had come in about a year ago.\nWord had come that the Demonic Cult's branch offices in various villages throughout Xinjiang had suddenly started teaching children the Thousand Character Classic.\nThat was enough news to bring the Murim Alliance into complete uproar.\n—Those lunatics must be trying to teach Demonic Arts to the children of Xinjiang!\n—We need to strike first right now! They've extended their evil influence even to young children; how can we turn a blind eye to such a horrific act!\n—Exactly! We need to wipe out those vile bastards immediately!\nA meeting was held with the heads of major Murim Alliance institutions and elders from renowned sects and noble families of the Central Plains as the attendants.\nThe majority of elders concluded that the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult was extending its evil influence to children to train warriors.\nIt was an accurate assessment.\nHowever.\n—So then, which sect will take the lead in this Demon-Exterminating Campaign?\nWhen the Alliance Leader posed this question, all those who had been making such a racket suddenly shut their mouths at the same time.\nThose zealots were all crazy bastards who didn't give a damn about their own lives.\nIt was obvious that fighting them would result in casualties, and among them, the being they worshipped as their god was on a completely different level.\nThe sheer weight of the Heavenly Demon’s name was on a level comparable to that of an entire great sect.\nOf course, they were confident that if the entire Central Plains united, they could easily wipe away those bastards at any time.\nThe problem was just one thing.\nThe sects taking the vanguard would suffer damage close to complete annihilation.\nEven if they were to wipe out the Demonic Cult, there would be nothing left to gain.\nThe Tianshan Mountain Range where the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult was located was incredibly far from the Central Plains.\nYou had to pass through Qinghai and then traverse the wastelands of Xinjiang to go much further west.\nUnlike this prosperous Central Plains where there were plenty of poor souls to extort money under the pretext of \"protection fees,\" taking over that place would gain them nothing.\n—Ahem. Our Hwangbo Family is located in the far east. It’s better for those near Xinjiang to clear the path first. We’ll join as quickly as possible once that’s done.\n—Heh. Speaking of distance, wouldn’t the Yunnan Diancan Sect. Sichuan Emei Sect, Qingcheng, and Sichuan Tang Family be more suitable to take the lead?\n—Are you out of your mind?\nAnd so began the routine of pushing and pulling each other to the front lines. The justice of the Murim Alliance couldn't be sustained by honor alone.\nTo them, justice wasn't an ideal but a reality.\nThey needed money to raise their sect's disciples. They had to expand their sect's territory and business to show off their prestige; how else could they face the founding masters who had passed on if they couldn’t even do that?\nOf course, they did practice justice.\nIn the areas near where their own sects were located, that is.\nThe common folk living and working hard there were their precious meal ticket—no, since they were such pitiful people, was it not true that only by protecting them could their sects enjoy glory for a long time to come?\nAh. There were occasional cases where they would get involved in the misfortunes of other regions.\nWhen other forces weakened, they could obtain justification to \"save\" the people there and expand their territory.\nThis was one of the biggest reasons why the Murim Alliance hadn't launched a preemptive strike against the Demonic Cult.\nThe Murim Alliance was a massive force formed by countless sects from the Central Plains joining together, but conversely, it wasn't a single unified power.\nSince there was no absolute leader, they moved according to the interests of their respective sects and noble families.\nThe Murim Alliance mostly just acted as a mediator when conflicts arose between member sects and families.\nThey only united in one case: when a common, massive enemy emerged, like an invasion from the Demonic Cult.\nThey'd join forces to block invaders trying to steal what was theirs, but when those enemies were holed up far away in the useless wastelands of Xinjiang, they didn't bother attacking.\nTrue to form as expired elders, they ended up repeating what they'd always done.\nThey hurled criticisms at each other wrapped in polite language, and time passed without any progress.\n—That's enough. Since the Demonic Cult hasn't made any overt moves yet, how about we settle on increasing surveillance of them for now?\nThe Alliance Leader could only step in to mediate with a weary expression on his face and offered his standard solution such as “let’s wait and see.”\nFollowing this decision, the Flying Dragon Pavilion had no choice but to stay busy for a while.\nThey had to dispatch new spies to Xinjiang and Qinghai.\nThanks to the news over the past year or so, the Murim Alliance held meetings about once a month.\nThey had thought the cult was planning to teach Demonic Arts to the children, but when news arrived that they were not teaching Demonic Arts and instead genuinely taught them the Thousand Character Classic, their doctrine, and some strange games, another fierce debate erupted.\n—These crazy bastards must be preparing some kind of weird sorcery! We need to attack immediately!\n—They're just lunatics doing crazy shit.\nWhen the fanatics suddenly started building new estates in several villages and later news came that they were gathering children from nearby villages to educate them there, arguments broke out again.\n—Those crazy bastards are definitely trying to lock up children and teach them demonic arts!\n—See! I told you! Didn't I say we should attack immediately!\n—If you're so eager to attack, why don't your sect go first!\nEven when news came that they were sending children back to their villages at regular intervals then bringing them back again, and that those vicious Heavenly Demon Divine Cult martial artists were personally pulling the carriages like livestock, they still quarreled like dogs.\n—They're definitely crazy bastards.\n—They seem to have collectively fallen into Qi Deviation, so how about we just keep watching for now?\n—Is that thing on your shoulders just for decoration? How can you allow yourselves to be so easily played by the schemes of those vicious bastards?\nThe Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord, who attended every one of those meetings, even had this thought, 'Those vicious Demonic Cult bastards must be trying to cause internal strife within our Murim Alliance!'\nOf course, being someone who had risen to the position of Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord, he didn't make the mistake of actually believing thoughts that came from anger.\nThat's why the intelligence his subordinate brought today was important.\nTo understand why those lunatics in the Xinjiang wastelands were suddenly doing such bizarre things. Most importantly, to prevent internal strife within the Murim Alliance.\nHiding these desperate inner thoughts, the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord looked at his subordinate.\n\"After consolidating information from our spies, the Demonic Cult fanatics are currently trying to educate children.\"\nA scowl creased the Pavilion Lord's face.\n\"Do you think we're making all this fuss because we don't know that?\"\nThe subordinate swallowed a dry gulp at his ever-composed superior's frigid voice. Though the tone itself was no different than usual, he knew from experience that this was a crisis.\n“There was no sorcery being used, nor was there some kind of hidden objective. It is undoubtedly for the simple purpose of teaching the children to raise them as future zealots of the Demonic Cult.”\n\"Then why aren't they teaching them Demonic Arts and instead doing exactly what we orthodox sects do? Those fanatics who are obsessed with Demonic Arts.\"\n\"That... that's because of the Eighth Disciple.\"\n\"...The Eighth Disciple?\"\nIt wasn't just because it was an unfamiliar title. He knew that a \"disciple\" in the Demonic Cult meant a student of the Heavenly Demon.\nIt's just that...\n\"Wasn't the Seventh Disciple the last one? And didn't that Seventh Disciple die?\"\n\"The Heavenly Demon has taken on a new disciple. And all of the Demonic Cult's current movements are said to be proposed by this Eighth Disciple.\"\n\"Why the hell would he do that?\"\n“A-As I stated before, they say it is for the purpose of educating the children to raise them as zealots of the Demonic Cult.”\n“And so I ask you, why isn't he teaching those damn Demonic Arts and instead starting with weird stuff?!\"\nThe Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord finally couldn't contain his anger at the conversation that kept going in circles.\nOf course, the subordinate who had come to report was also having a hellish time.\n'It's not like we can make contact with the Eighth Disciple. How the hell are we supposed to figure out his intentions?!'\nIt was a scream he couldn't voice aloud.\nThis was the Murim Alliance, not the Demonic Cult. It was a peaceful place where you wouldn't get your head chopped off for yelling at your superior a bit.\nYou'd just get kicked out of the Murim Alliance peacefully.\nOn the surface, at least.\nWell, there was the risk that while wandering the streets after being kicked out, or climbing mountains, or resting at home, some black-clad figure might suddenly appear and sever your limbs and meridians, destroy your dantian, or \"accidentally\" pierce your neck or heart, but those were just minor incidents.\n\"This subordinate is inadequate and has not yet been able to grasp the Eighth Disciple's intentions.\"\nThe subordinate swallowed his grievances and immediately dropped to his knees to beg forgiveness.\nSuch was the sorrow of middle management.\nThe Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord glared coldly at his kneeling subordinate, let out a deep sigh, then spoke.\n\"I'll give you one last chance. Investigate everything you can about this Eighth Disciple and report back.\"\n\"This disciple wishes to go to the Central Plains to see the wider world.\"\n“See the wider world, you say…”\nAt the somewhat lukewarm response from the Heavenly Demon, Il-mok's tongue began to dance.\n\"Thanks to the various reform measures Master is implementing, Xinjiang is currently facing a period of great transformation. However, strengthening internal affairs while neglecting surveillance of the outside world could potentially invite a crisis.\"\n\"So you're saying you'll become the spearhead to observe the flow of the Central Plains?\"\n\"That is correct.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon stroked his beard with a thoughtful expression.\nWhen the Heavenly Demon's reaction was more lukewarm than expected, Il-mok realized he needed to implement his second plan.\nThud.\n\"!?\"\nWhen Il-mok suddenly prostrated himself again, the Heavenly Demon looked bewildered.\nRegardless of the Heavenly Demon's reaction, Il-mok shouted at the top of his lungs. New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on N()velFire.net\n\"Please punish this disciple's sins!\"\n\"!?\"\n\"This disciple dared to dream of going to the Central Plains for selfish purposes!\"\nAs the old saying goes, it’s better to say sorry than beg for forgiveness.\nIl-mok's prepared second strategy was voluntary confession followed by self-flagellation.\nBang! Bang!\nIl-mok boldly struck his forehead against the floor and cried out.\n\"While it's true I want to monitor the Central Plains' movements, it wasn't purely for the safety of our Divine Cult!\"\nAnd just before Il-mok's forehead hit the floor for the third time...\nA powerful aura grabbed hold of Il-mok's body.\n\"When you say selfish purposes, you mean the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord, don't you?\"\nAt his Master's question, Il-mok naturally felt his lips curve upward.\nHowever, by the time he raised his head, he had already returned to a sorrowful expression.\n\"That is correct. As a man, and as a warrior of the Divine Cult, how could I live forgetting the enemy of someone who was like a parent to me?\"\nTo avenge the one who was like a parent.\nWhat more splendid justification could there possibly be?\nOf course, Il-mok wasn't just planning to use this as a mere justification.\nThat bastard really was Uncle Tae-hyeon's enemy, so he fully intended to personally cut off his head someday.\nIt's just that...\n'Well, just because I'm going to the Central Plains doesn't mean I have to meet that bastard right away.'\nHe was simply considering revenge to be a matter for the distant future.",

    "novel_title": "So, Did Someone Force You to Become the Heavenly Demon",
    "chapter_number": "Chapter 179",
    "content": "Chapter 179: Career Path (4)\nAbout a month before the Hall of the Demonic Way graduation ceremony, a special event unfolded in the Hyeokryeon Family—one of the Five Great Families of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult and the prestigious house that had produced the current Heavenly Demon.\nHyeokryeon Hwan, the eldest son of Family Head Hyeokryeon Cheongang and heir to the position, finally emerged from over three years of secluded training.\n\"We greet the Young Lord!\"\nYou have changed so much we almost didn’t recognize you, Young Lord!”\nDespite all the praise from the household members, Hyeokryeon Hwan just nodded gravely and headed somewhere with a heavy expression.\nHe was on his way to the Family Head’s chamber to inform his father that he'd completed his secluded training.\nAs he approached the hall, Hyeokryeon Cheongang's voice called out from inside.\n\"Come in.\"\nHyeokryeon Hwan nodded with an \"as expected\" look on his face. Even though he'd broken through to a new level during his training, his father had still instantly sensed his presence.\nEntering the hall, Hyeokryeon Hwan bowed formally to the Family Head.\n\"I greet the Family Head.\"\n\"Good. Sit down.\"\nAccepting the greeting brusquely, Hyeokryeon Cheongang spoke as soon as his son sat down.\n\"You've broken through another wall.\"\n\"It's all thanks to you, Family Head.\"\n\"Right. If you break through just two more walls, I might be able to hand over this position to you.\"\n\"How could someone who's barely touched the Transcendence dare to push out the Family Head?\"\nThe Demonic Cult operates by the law of the strong. The most obvious example is the tradition of the struggle for cult leadership, in which the strongest becomes the cult leader and learns the Heavenly Demon Divine Arts.\nNaturally, a tradition similar to that of the Cult was also passed down in the prestigious houses known as the Five Great Families.\nAnd thanks to over three years of secluded training, Hyeokryeon Hwan had reached a level just short of the Transcendence. As his father said, if he broke through just two more walls, he'd reach the level where he could achieve Transcendence with the Blood Shadow Eighteen Swords.\nBut the current Family Head had achieved Transcendence for nearly twenty years. He wasn't someone you could beat just because you'd freshly achieved Transcendence.\nIn other words, the conversation between the two was similar to what occurred in a royal or imperial court.\nIt was a situation where the emperor or king suggests abdicating the throne to their accomplished child, and the crown prince or heir reacts with feigned shock, declaring how someone as unworthy as himself could possibly dare to oust His Majesty and ascend the throne.\nAt least, that's how it looked on the surface.\nSeeing his son continue to address him as \"Family Head\" and respond so curtly, Hyeokryeon Cheongang let out a light sigh.\n\"Are you still holding a grudge about the secluded training?\"\n\"Not at all, Family Head. I'm simply trying to act appropriately for my position as th Young Lord, as you instructed.\"\nAt his son's blunt response, Hyeokryeon Cheongang swallowed another sigh.\nHyeokryeon Hwan's seclusion hadn't been voluntary.\nHyeokryeon Cheongang had forcibly locked him in a cave with orders not to come out until he broke through to the next level.\nHis attitude was now completely different from before he entered seclusion. No matter how one looked at it, it seemed less like an attempt to act befitting of the Young Lord and more like a clear display of sulking. But Hyeokryeon Cheongang decided to let it slide for now.\n“In any case, it is fortunate that you have broken through a threshold. Continue to strive and devote yourself to your training so that you may enter Transcendence.\"\n\"I will do so, Family Head.\"\nHyeokryeon Hwan bowed formally again and left the Family Head's hall.\n\"We greet the Young Lord!\"\n\"Congratulations on completing your seclusion!\"\nHe would give a solemn nod each time he encountered household members on his path who bowed to him.\nAfter passing the servants, the second place he arrived at was his own quarters.\nAnd there, waiting for him, was the woman who had handled his duties as Young Lord while he was away.\n\"Husband!\"\n\"My dear!\"\nThe couple, reunited after more than three years, exchanged passionate looks.\nIt was a sight that would have shocked Il-mok.\nA lovely smile was drawn upon the face of the notoriously spiteful Lady Cheonghwa.\n\"You've worked so hard while I was away, my dear.\"\n\"As someone who will become the madam of the great Hyeokryeon Family, it was simply my duty.”\nTheir conversation was ordinary, but the looks they exchanged carried something heated. A burning hint that something would happen tonight.\nAfter catching up with his wife for a while, Lady Cheonghwa, who knew her husband very well, gently broached a subject.\n\"Are you looking for Seon-ah?\"\nThough it was but a subtle flicker of his eyes, she had not missed her husband’s gaze periodically scanning the interior of the hall.\n\"Ahem. Well, yes.\"\nHyeokryeon Hwan answered with an awkward tone.\n\"I'll lead the way. Let's go together.\"\n\"Are you sure it's alright? Isn't Seon-ah in the middle of training the Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art right now?\"\n“Shouldn’t a daughter naturally greet her father after meeting him for the first time in so long? Besides, it is fine for her to meet and talk with you.”\n\"It seems Seon-ah is overcoming the side effects of the Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art!\"\nAs Hyeokryeon Hwan exclaimed with a bright smile, Lady Cheonghwa replied with a reluctant expression.\n\"Y-yes, that's right.\"\nShe wasn't entirely sure whether you could call it \"overcoming\" the side effects.\nBut with his head already full of thoughts about Seon-ah, Hyeokryeon Hwan didn't notice his wife's subtle change in expression.\n\"Let's go.\"\nEventually, Hyeokryeon Hwan followed Lady Cheonghwa's lead to meet the daughter who now lived separately.\nThis was because of the side effects of the Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art.\nTo think he had to live apart from his daughter, who was barely over ten years old!\n'She should stay in her father's embrace until at least thirty!'\nHyeokryeon Hwan swallowed his anguished cry.\nThe reason Hyeokryeon Hwan had been forcibly put into seclusion by his father was simple.\nHe was seriously overprotective of his daughter.\nIt wasn't just that he interfered with his daughter's training. It had reached a level where it interfered with his own training.\nDuring the hours he should have been training the Blood Shadow Eighteen Swords, he'd spend all day and night clinging to his daughter.\nUnable to bear this pathetic sight any longer, Hyeokryeon Cheongang had finally exploded and thrown him into a cave.\nThanks to that, he'd broken through a wall but felt no gratitude toward his father for it.\n'For my daughter's sake, I'd gladly give my life!'\nHe'd broken through purely because of his daughter Seon-ah. With the single-minded determination to see his daughter's adorable face again, he'd devoted himself to swordplay like a madman until he broke through.\nHyeokryeon Cheongang was mistaken. He'd hoped the secluded training would help Hyeokryeon Hwan overcome his obsession with his daughter, but the symptoms had worsened.\nIt was an understandable mistake. Hyeokryeon Cheongang saw his son's condition as being influenced by the side effects of his Demonic Art..\nBut Hyeokryeon Hwan's overprotectiveness wasn't influenced by Demonic Art. It was pure paternal love for his daughter.\nIt wasn't the kind of thing that would disappear just because he couldn't see her face for a while or his martial arts level improved slightly. If anything, it only got worse.\n'Ah, I need to manage my expression.'\nIt took all his willpower to keep the goofy smile from his lips as he walked toward his daughter.\n'Just act normal. That damn father of mine might lock me in the cave again if he sees this.'\nThe reason Hyeokryeon Hwan had been acting stern and grave since completing his seclusion was purely to avoid being locked up again.\nTo prevent any interference with reuniting with his daughter, he desperately managed his expression as he headed somewhere.\nFollowing Lady Cheonghwa's guidance, they arrived at a training ground set up in one corner of the Hyeokryeon estate.\nAnd there she was.\nHis daughter, whose hair had turned red due to the influence of the Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art.\n\"Hah!\"\nWith a spirited cry, she swung her similarly reddened claws.\nChildren grow up so fast. Although only three and a half years have passed, that tiny child has grown so much.\nTears were already forming in Hyeokryeon Hwan's eyes, but he didn't rush to his daughter. He even stopped his wife from calling out to Seon-ah. He just watched his daughter's training with a proud expression.\nThen, when Hyeokryeon Seon-ah finished repeating her training until her internal energy was depleted and took a deep breath—\n\"Whew.\"\nClap clap clap.\nHe applauded thunderously, celebrating his daughter's achievement.\nHyeokryeon Seon-ah's eyes widened as she turned at the sudden applause.\n\"Father?\"\nEven though his daughter, who used to call him \"daddy\" when she was little, now used the more distant \"father,\" Hyeokryeon Hwan smiled contentedly.\n“Hahaha. Our daughter has grown so much in three years!\"\n\"Father also seems to have achieved great things. I truly congratulate you.\"\nEven at his daughter's polite but distant response, Hyeokryeon Hwan smiled happily.\n\"Hahaha. Truly praiseworthy.\"\nHe saw her polite behavior as a sign she was overcoming the side effects of the Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art.\nHis daughter, who had somehow become a fifteen-year-old young lady, smiled gracefully at her father's praise and replied.\n\"I've been doing my best in training to stay by big brother's side.\"\n\"...Big brother?\"\nHearing this expression from his daughter for the first time, Hyeokryeon Hwan's thoughts stopped as he turned to look at his wife.\n“We have a son?”\nA long, weary sigh escaped Lady Cheonghwa's lips.\nLady Cheonghwa led the stunned Hyeokryeon Hwan back to the young master's hall.\nA little later, after barely pulling Hyeokryeon Hwan out of his mental breakdown, she explained what had happened.\n\"The big brother Seon-ah speaks of is the youngest disciple that the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons recently took in.\"\n\"Three years ago, when Seon-ah was learning the Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art, she became close to that youngest disciple.\"\n\"Thankfully, even after that youngest disciple entered the Hall of the Demonic Way, Seon-ah didn't go berserk or fall into Qi Deviation. She's just... waiting eagerly...\"\nLady Cheonghwa's explanation came in brief, scattered pieces.\nShe had no choice. Every time she explained something, her husband would fall into another mental breakdown.\nHaving barely managed to hear the full explanation before spitting blood, Hyeokryeon Hwan shouted without having recovered his composure.\n\"How could you let such a lecher get close to Seon-ah!\"\nAnd just like that, Il-mok had instantly been branded a lecher.\nHer expression soured at the accusation. After three and a half years, this was what he had to say to her?\n“Are you really scolding me right now, you who have been absent for over three years?”\nHyeokryeon Hwan instinctively felt it. The hot night of rekindling their relationship after three and a half years was in danger of becoming as cold as ice from the eternal snow mountains.\n\"I-I wasn't trying to scold you. S-sorry. That's right! I meant father!

    "content": "Chapter 180: Career Path (5)\nAs Hyeokryeon Hwan kept radiating murderous intent, his daughter Hyeokryeon Seon-ah, who was walking beside him, frowned.\n\"Father.\"\nThat single short call made Hyeokryeon Hwan flinch and quickly rein in his killing aura.\n“Ahem. It seems this father of yours is a little n-nervous at the thought of meeting the famous youngest disciple.\"\nLike the doting father he was, Hyeokryeon Hwan was completely powerless against his daughter.\nThe reason he was bringing his daughter along on this trip to meet the very bastard who was lusting after her was pretty much the same story.\nToday was the day that damned lecher would be returning from completing his training at the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nHyeokryeon Hwan had planned to go alone, but Seon-ah had been ready to commit suicide if he tried to stop her from coming, so they ended up with this bizarre arrangement.\nStill, he tried to think positively; at least he got to walk with his daughter like this, right?\nAfter enjoying this happy time with his daughter for a while, Hyeokryeon Hwan's expression turned puzzled when they reached the vicinity of Windrock Palace.\nThere were already several men waiting there.\nOnce he recognized who they were, Hyeokryeon Hwan had to quickly bow in formal greeting.\n\"I pay my respects to the Family Head of the Baek Family, the First Disciple, and the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall.\"\nEach and every one of them ranked higher than him, a mere Young Lord of the Hyeokryeon Family.\n‘I already heard from my wife that the First Disciple cares for the youngest disciple, but why the hell are the Baek Family’s head and the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall here too?’\nAs the Young Lord of one of the Five Great Families, he held a position that commanded respect even within the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nOn top of that, his Demonic Art was approaching Transcendence, so there weren't many stronger than him in the cult. The only ones at a similar level would be the heads of various combat units.\nAnd yet, to think that three masters superior to himself were gathered here...\n\"Haha! I heard you finished your closed-door training. Young Lord Hyeokryeon. I've been so busy with Demon-Teaching Pavilion affairs that I haven't been able to properly greet you. It's good to see you like this. You seem to have achieved great things while I wasn't looking.\"\nFirst Disciple Wi Jin-hak, who was only two years older and thus somewhat familiar with him, welcomed him warmly.\n\"Not nearly as much as the First Disciple has achieved. Haha.\"\nHyeokryeon Hwan responded to his greeting with an awkward laugh, still wondering why three such big shots were gathered here.\nAnd he wasn't the only one with questions.\n‘Why is Young Lord Hyeokryeon here too? Don't tell me the Hyeokryeon Family is also eyeing the next Cult Leader position? Is this the Young Lord acting on his own, or did Hyeokryeon Cheongang order this?’\nThe Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall was thinking the same thing.\n‘So many people coming to see our youngest. It's gratifying that others recognize his worth, but all of them might become my enemies in the future.’\nThe First Disciple, who was planning for life after their Master's departure, felt conflicted emotions.\nAll four men wore smiles on their faces while internally trying to gauge each other's purposes through meaningless pleasantries.\nOnly one person had no interest in the four men's conversation.\nHyeokryeon Seon-ah.\nShe kept turning her head this way and that, wondering when the person she was waiting for would arrive, until her eyes widened.\n\"Big brother!\"\nEven before she called out, the four men had already sensed someone approaching and turned to see Il-mok and Jin Hayeon coming their way.\nSeon-ah ran toward Il-mok as if her father didn't even exist, while Wi Jin-hak laughed heartily and greeted Il-mok.\n\"Youngest! Come here quickly. Hahaha!\"\n\"I pay my respects to Eldest Brother.\"\nIl-mok bowed formally to his senior brother, then hesitated when he was about to pat the head of Seon-ah, who had run up to him.\nThe little kid had grown up quite a bit in two years. It felt a bit inappropriate to treat her like a child as he used to.\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"I was waiting for you, big brother.\"\nWhen Il-mok's hand moved toward her head but then dropped back down, Seon-ah's eyes followed it with a hint of disappointment.\nBut Il-mok's gaze had already moved past Seon-ah toward Windrock Palace.\n‘Who the hell are those guys?’\nExcept for his senior brother, the other three were complete strangers.\nThe vibe was weird.\nOne looked at him like he was prey, another seemed excited, and...\n‘What's up with him? Is he having a stroke?’\nThe last one looked completely spaced out.\nThat was Hyeokryeon Hwan, who had turned into a statue after his daughter abandoned him and ran to the youngest disciple.\nIl-mok returned to Windrock Palace with Jin Hayeon, who had been waiting at the Heavenly Demon Hall, and entered with the guests who were waiting at the entrance.\nJin Hayeon, who had always been a capable maid, quickly prepared to receive guests, and Il-mok sat facing the four visitors around the refreshment table she had set up.\nSince it was time for the adults to have their conversation, Seon-ah was waiting outside with Jin Hayeon.\nIl-mok smiled and greeted them first.\n\"Thank you for coming to visit. I apologize for not having much to offer since I was away for so long. But what brings you all here today?\"\nIl-mok obviously hid his inner thoughts of wanting them to leave quickly. ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ noⅴelfire.net\nFor a moment, the four with different goals fought a strange war of nerves to measure each other's purposes.\nFirst Disciple Wi Jin-hak was the first to break into hearty laughter and speak up.\n\"Hahaha! What special reason could there be? This elder brother's precious youngest completed his training at the Hall of the Demonic Way, so I came to congratulate him. Hahaha!\"\n\"Thank you, Eldest Brother.\"\nIl-mok bowed formally again.\nHe swallowed the unspoken words: Now that you've congratulated me enough, how about you leave?\nThe Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall, who saw Wi Jin-hak as a competitor, spoke a bit more directly than Wi Jin-hak.\n\"Hahaha! This Chief also came to congratulate the Eighth Disciple on completing his training. But completing the Hall of the Demonic Way is not an end but a beginning. So shouldn't the Eighth Disciple start thinking about which organization to join?\"\nIl-mok immediately understood his intention.\n‘Phew. Good thing I got permission from Master in advance.’\nThanks to presenting the justification of wanting revenge on the Flying Dragon Pavilion Master and understanding Central Plains politics, the Heavenly Demon had responded positively to considering Il-mok's journey to the Central Plains.\n\"I was actually just coming back from discussing that matter with Master, but since Master has given me a specific mission, I can't really discuss it freely.\"\nWhen Il-mok completely shut him down by invoking the Heavenly Demon's name, the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall couldn't say much more.\n\"Hmm. So Master has already assigned you work. I had hoped to lead the Demon-Teaching Pavilion together with our excellent junior brother to nurture the cult's talents. What a shame.\"\nUnlike the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall, the First Disciple openly showed his disappointment but didn't push further.\n‘Since I used Master as an excuse, they should all leave soon.’\nIl-mok assumed the remaining two had the same purpose as the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall and Eldest Brother, but he was mistaken.\nBaek Un-hak, who had been quietly listening to the three's conversation, suddenly spoke up.\n\"I came here because I absolutely wanted to thank the Eighth Disciple personally.\"\nSince Il-mok had never met Baek Un-hak before, he couldn't help but look puzzled.\nOver a year ago.\nThe day after Baek Cheon turned Baek Un-hak's world upside down and left for the Central Plains.\nBaek Un-hak had been summoned to the Heavenly Demon Palace by the Heavenly Demon.\n\"I pay my respects to the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons.\"\nWhile bowing to the Heavenly Demon, Baek Un-hak had to do his best to control his expression due to his fury toward the Eighth Disciple who had filled his precious second son’s head with nonsense\n“Hahaha. You may rise.”\nAnd right after he stood up following the Heavenly Demon's instruction, Baek Un-hak almost lost control of his expression.\n\"Lord Baek. You've raised your second son magnificently.\"\n‘What kind of bullshit is this?’\nHis son had abandoned an important position to head to the Central Plains branch, and now the Heavenly Demon was mocking him?\nBaek Un-hak managed his expression so desperately that his lips twitched before finally managing to ask the Heavenly Demon.\n\"I am too foolish to dare understand the Supreme One’s meaning.\"\n\"Hahaha! There's no need for such modesty. There is no need to deny of your second son’s great ambition.”\n\"...Great ambitions?\"\nBaek Un-hak asked back with a confused expression, and only then did the Heavenly Demon stroke his beard and ask with a curious face.\n“Has Lord Baek not heard? The reason your second son headed to the Central Plains.\"\nBaek Un-hak recalled yesterday's events.\nHis son said the Baek Family was too small and that he would head to the Central Plains. Come to think of it, he did seem to harbor some great ambition.\nIt's just that, as the Family Head, he had only seen it as the immature act of a still-young son.\nBut judging by the Heavenly Demon's reaction, that great ambition seemed to be something even the master of the cult would acknowledge.\n\"Hmm. Since my son said he had great ambitions, I let him go but didn't look into the details.\"\n“Hahaha. Now that I see it, it seems the second son has inherited his father’s heroic heart.\"\n“I am honored by your words.”\nBaek Un-hak bowed formally at the Heavenly Demon's praise and carefully asked to satisfy his rising curiosity.\n“Forgive my impertinence, but may I dare to ask what Cheon’s great ambition is?\"\n\"Hehehe. Let me tell you.”\nThe Heavenly Demon readily showed his agreement and spoke of past events with the expression of someone recalling a fond memory.\nOf what had happened at the Hall of the Demonic Way graduation ceremony.\n“It was surprising enough that a play was created based on this old man and my youngest disciple, but the real show was what came after.”\nHearing that the second son of one of the Five Great Families had gotten obsessed with something as trivial as theater made Baek Un-hak's expression management even more difficult, but the following words completely reversed his feelings.\n\"He said he would create plays about the stories of the previous Heavenly Demons to spread their greatness to the masses.\"\nOnly then did Baek Un-hak fully understand his son's purpose, and he felt like he'd been hit with a massive club.\nIt wasn't just because of that great ambition.\n‘Come to think of it, if what the Supreme One says is true, then Cheon also played the Heavenly Demon in the graduation ceremony play.’\nIf the play was meant to preach the greatness of the Heavenly Demon, then the protagonist was obviously the Heavenly Demon.\nOnly then did Baek Un-hak realize.\n‘Our Cheon wasn't going down the wrong path after all.’\nThe side effect of the Baek Family's secret art, the Hundred Flower Demonic Art, was an obsessive need for attention.\nHe had been worried that his son, who was starved for attention, might have gone down the wrong path by rejecting even the attention of family elders.\n‘Cheon, this kid was trying to get attention from the entire world by leaving the family! And by spreading the great achievements of our Divine Cult far and wide, no less!’\nHis second son really had found the family too small. And it was all thanks to the youngest disciple's advice.\n\"Thanks to the Eighth Disciple, our Cheon has headed to the Central Plains with great ambitions. How could I not personally thank the Eighth Disciple for giving such wonderful advice?”\nStill not understanding Baek Un-hak's words, Il-mok finally asked back.\n“If you are referring to my advice, what advice are you speaking of?”\n“Hahaha. My, my, it seems the Eighth Disciple is also a humble one. Is it not thanks to you that our Cheon took an interest in plays and decided to preach the greatness of the Divine Cult through them?”\nOnly then did Il-mok recall a certain memory.\nThe memory of giving some advice to Baek Cheon while he was being punished and of Baek Cheon becoming a genuine madman ever since.\n\"I'm truly grateful for that. Eighth Disciple.\"\nBaek Un-hak bowed formally once again to express his thanks.\nWhether by age, status, or martial arts level, this was a man who was clearly Il-mok's superior in every way. Yet, here he was formally expressing his thank you.\nHowever, the expression on Il-mok’s face as he received the greeting was peculiar.\nIt wasn't because of the crazy father thanking him for making his son even more insane.\nAfter three years in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, he was used to crazy behavior.\nRight now, a more important problem was surfacing in Il-mok's mind.\n‘Please don't tell me I'm going to run into that lunatic again in the Central Plains.’\nAfter hearing that Baek Cheon had headed to the Central Plains, an inexplicable sense of dread crept up his spine.",

    "content": "Chapter 181: Career Path (6)\nWi Jin-hak burst into boisterous laughter as he watched the conversation between Baek Un-hak and Il-mok unfold.\n\"Hahaha! Looks like our youngest has pulled off something big again without me even knowing about it. Haha!\"\nHe looked as pleased as if he'd accomplished the feat himself.\n\"I'll be honest with you. I've heard countless rumors about the Eighth Young Master, but I always considered them somewhat exaggerated. However, thanks to this recent matter with my Cheon, I have truly come to realize that the Eighth Young Master is a genius.”\n\"Haha! Our youngest really is an outstanding fellow. How could we not be tempted to have him on our side?\"\nSuddenly, both Baek Un-hak and Wi Jin-hak started singing Il-mok's praises. Meanwhile, the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall kept staring at Il-mok with greedy eyes that practically dripped with desire; it’s clear that he has not given up yet.\nIn the middle of this warm atmosphere, the previously silent Hyeokryeon Hwan finally spoke up.\n\"Eighth Young Master, I'd like to ask you something.\"\n\"Please, go ahead, Young Lord Hyeokryeon.\"\n\"What do you think of our Seon-ah?\"\n\"...\"\nIl-mok looked at Hyeokryeon Hwan like he was completely insane.\nHyeokryeon Hwan had been in a daze ever since he witnessed his daughter abandon him completely and run straight to Il-mok.\nBy the time he finally snapped back to his senses, various conversations had already taken place around him.\nAnd so, Hyeokryeon Hwan had decided to quietly observe the conversation to determine just what kind of scumbag this lecher who dared to covet his daughter truly was.\nAnd then it hit him.\n'This lecher... he's actually this capable?'\nOf course, he'd heard about Il-mok's exploits through his wife. On top of that, he vaguely remembered his daughter occasionally singing Il-mok's praises.\nYet, consumed by a bitter jealousy, the more his daughter praised him, the more negative preconceptions about this Il-mok character had piled up in his mind.\nUntil he came here today to meet Il-mok, the image Hyeokryeon Hwan had painted in his head was of some incompetent delinquent street thug with bleached yellow hair and sun-darkened skin.\nYet, the reality could not have been more different.\nTwo of the most notable figures within the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult were lavishing all sorts of praise upon the Eighth Young Master in an attempt to win him over.\nThe Family Head of the Baek Family was actually showing a young man far beneath him in station with proper courtesy.\nAt this point, there is no need to doubt the Eighth Young Master's abilities.\nBut that wasn't enough to satisfy this overprotective father.\n'Fine. I'll acknowledge the Eighth Young Master's capabilities. But I can't just hand over my daughter to some lecher, no matter how capable he is!'\nA man's abilities matter when it comes to ensuring a daughter's peaceful married life, but so does his character.\n\"What do you think of our Seon-ah?\"\nHe asked Il-mok with the most serious expression in the world, like a father-in-law testing his prospective son-in-law on their first meeting.\nOf course, from Il-mok's perspective, this was absolutely ridiculous.\nNo matter how much Seon-ah had grown over the past two years, she was still fifteen by local standards. In the modern world Il-mok was familiar with, she'd be at most a middle school sophomore or high school freshman.\n‘Is he trying to get me arrested?’ Follow current novels on novᴇlfire.net\nHe could practically hear the sound of handcuffs clicking. How was he supposed to think about someone like that?\n\"I think of her as a cute little sister.\"\n\"Little sister? So you don't think of her as a woman?\"\nWhen Hyeokryeon Hwan pressed him, Il-mok decided to nail this down once and for all.\n\"I don't consider any woman who hasn't reached her prime years as a woman, Young Lord Hyeokryeon.\"\nPrime years.\nJust as a man's twentieth year is called his coming-of-age, this term referred to a woman's twentieth year, which was supposedly her most beautiful age.\nThe word alone was enough to make fire dance in Hyeokryeon Hwan’s gaze.\n'This damn thief! I won’t give away my daughter until she's thirty, and he's already thinking about taking her at barely twenty!'\nFor the doting father, the age of twenty was way too young.\nAnd Hyeokryeon Hwan wasn't the only one whose eyes lit up with fire.\n‘How foolish of me! He likes women in their prime, so setting him up with Xiao Hong was bound to fail!'\nThe Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall quickly started racking his brain, trying to remember if any of his subordinates' or acquaintances' children were around that age.\n“Hahaha! It seems our youngest has quite firm preferences!”\nThe First Disciple laughed heartily and mentally ran through a list of women in that age group.\nThat night, news of what happened at Windrock Palace reached the Heavenly Demon's ears.\n\"Hahaha. So Jin-hak, the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall, the Family Head of the Baek Family, and Young Lord Hyeokryeon all went to see our youngest?\"\n\"That is correct, Lord of Ten Thousand Demons.\"\nWhen the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master replied with a bow, the Heavenly Demon stroked his beard thoughtfully.\n“Hmm. What do you think of this, then? Shall we expand the scale of the Hall of the Demonic Way’s graduation ceremony?”\n“Forgive me. This foolish servant is too dull to dare presume your meaning.”\n“Haha, currently, the students at the Demonic Way are required to present a performance at the graduation ceremony, do they not? How about expanding the influence and increasing the number of spectators at the graduation ceremony? That way, the various institutes within our Divine Cult can pick up prospective talents more efficiently.”\nOnly then did the Hidden Guard Pavilion Master grasp the Heavenly Demon's intent and speak with a face full of admiration.\n“The Supreme One intends to have the heads of various institutions and martial organizations attend the ceremony directly and recruit students right there?\"\n\"Exactly. Going further, our educational infrastructure is set to expand significantly in the coming years. We could also have kids who are about to enter the Hall of the Demonic Way attend these ceremonies to boost their motivation.\"\nIt's hard to come up with completely new ideas, but incrementally improving upon what already exists is not so hard.\nThanks to Il-mok creating a new educational system and foundation, the Heavenly Demon was driving various additional changes every day.\nOf course, this meant groans of pain echoed throughout the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's main headquarters and various parts of Xinjiang, but that wasn't the Heavenly Demon's concern.\nAfter all, he was a man who believed that pain was a necessary companion to progress.\nWhile contemplating various other inspirations, the Heavenly Demon suddenly put on a pleased expression.\n“On that subject, you mentioned our youngest talked about his preference for women?\"\n“Yes. It is said he revealed that he is only interested in women who have reached their prime years. Because of that comment, the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall and First Disciple seem to be moving about busily.\"\n“Hehehe, I'm truly curious what kind of woman would suit our youngest.\"\nThe Heavenly Demon had the expression of a grandfather thinking about his grandson who'd reached marriageable age.\nHe wasn't worried that his youngest disciple would become obsessed with women and neglect his training.\nThis was a world where it was natural for heroes to have multiple wives and concubines. And when you are an eighteen-year-old genius who’d started breaking free from Extremity, such concerns were pretty much pointless.\nEven when he was supposedly womanizing at the Hall of Demonic Way, hadn't he still managed to reach the Extremity?\n\"Hmm?\"\nWhen his thoughts reached this point, the Heavenly Demon frowned and spoke.\n\"But if he likes women who've reached their prime years, how did the story about him womanizing at the Demonic Way even come about?\"\nThe Heavenly Demon was starting to have doubts about Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi's handling of affairs.\nThe next morning.\nUnaware that gossip about his personal preferences was spreading throughout the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, Il-mok awoke from his sleep.\nAt the same time, Jin Hayeon's voice came from beyond his door.\n“I have prepared water for you to wash with, Young Master.”\nAfter washing his face with the water she'd prepared and finishing the breakfast she'd brought, Il-mok was enjoying some leisure time when new visitors arrived at Windrock Palace.\nThe first to greet him was someone Il-mok had never seen before.\n\"Hidden Guard Pavilion First Squad Leader Dam Bin pays her respects to the Eighth Young Master.\"\nShe appeared to be in her late thirties and was neatly dressed in servant's clothing similar to Jin Hayeon's.\nFollowing her, a number of rather familiar faces offered their greetings.\n\"We pay our respects to the Eighth Young Master.\"\n\"We pay our respects to the Eighth Young Master.\"\nThough they saluted Il-mok, the men's and women's eyes were fixed on someone else.\nIt was Ouyang Mun and Ju Seo-yeon.\n\"E-Eighth Young Master, I-I pay my respects.\"\nAnd there was Jeong Hyeon, stuttering and shrinking back.\nIt was quite a bizarre combination.\n\"Good to see you, Squad Leader Dam Bin. Young Warrior Ouyang. Miss Ju, Miss Jeong, welcome. But what brings you here so early in the morning?\"\nIl-mok knew that Ju Seo-yeon and Jeong Hyeon had joined the Hidden Guard Pavilion. Ju Seo-yeon went without saying, and Jeong Hyeon had mentioned several times near the end of their Demonic Way days that she'd be joining the Hidden Guard Pavilion.\nIl-mok just couldn't figure out why these four had come together.\nIn response to Il-mok's question, Dam Bin spoke on behalf of the group.\n\"The three of us have come to serve you alongside Hayeon starting today.\"\n\"Then how did Young Warrior Ouyang end up coming with you?\"\n\"We just happened to meet at the entrance.\"\n\"...\"\nIl-mok looked at Ouyang Mun with his mouth agape.\n'This guy's really something else.'\nWhile Il-mok was letting out a hollow laugh, Dam Bin spoke again.\n\"Both Jeong Hyeon and Ju Seo-yeon are new recruits to the Hidden Guard Pavilion and need training, but they have connections with you from the Demonic Way, so they've been assigned here together. Hayeon and I will do our utmost to teach them so they won't interfere with serving you.\"\nDam Bin's extremely respectful manner left Il-mok feeling somewhat awkward.\n'Did I get too used to life at the Hall of the Demonic Way?'\nAll students were equal there, and instructors around Dam Bin's age had been his superiors.\nAnd right after graduating from the Demonic Way, he'd been meeting with people like his master, the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall, his senior disciple brother, and the head of the Baek Family in succession, so this kind of extreme courtesy felt strange in many ways.\n“Ahem. I will be in your care.”\nOnce Il-mok gave his permission, Dam Bin turned to address Jeong Hyeon and Ju Seo-yeon, who were standing behind her.\n\"This senior will teach you from now on, so greet her properly.\"\nThe person Dam Bin pointed to was Jin Hayeon.\nObviously, Ju Seo-yeon cupped her fists with an absolutely delighted expression, while Jeong Hyeon stammered through her greeting.\n\"We pay our respects to Senior Jin Hayeon!\"\n\"W-we pay our r-respects to S-Senior Jin Hayeon.\"\nTo the surprise of some, Jin Hayeon replied to their greetings in a tone that was a little gentler than usual.\n\"Last time, I was too busy nursing the Young Master to properly greet you both. I look forward to working together.\"\nThis was the reason why Jin Hayeon, a practitioner of the White Hand Demonic Art, harbored a faint sense of goodwill toward the two of them, and it was also the reason they had been assigned as Il-mok’s attendants and guards the moment they joined the Hidden Guard Pavilion.\nIt was because these two had contributed the most to Il-mok's survival during the fanatic attack.\n“I am in your debt, so if you ever need instruction, do not hesitate to ask.”\nAt Jin Ha-yeon's words, Ju Seo-yeon's clear eyes practically sparkled.\nJu Seo-yeon had no intention of letting Jin Hayeon’s offer of goodwill end with mere words.\n“I have a request, Senior Hayeon!”\n\"Speak.\"\n\"As a token of appreciation for our hard work that day, could you give me just one hug?\"\n\"...?\"\nThough puzzled by this unexpected request, Jin Hayeon approached Ju Seo-yeon and spread her arms without much thought.\n'Oh shit.'\nIl-mok tried to stop Jin Ha-yeon, but he was a step too late.\n\"You worked hard.\"\nJin Hayeon was already hugging Ju Seo-yeon with her characteristically expressionless face.\n\"...\"\nAnd Ju Seo-yeon had turned into a statue of bliss, completely lost in ecstasy.\nIt was a face that made you wonder if she had practiced Daoist Art instead of Demonic Art and achieved immortal enlightenment.\n'Sorry, Miss Jin.'\nWhile Il-mok was silently apologizing to Jin Hayeon, a dark shadow approached him.\n\"Young Master Il-mok, I will definitely risk my life to protect you as well. If you ever need to go somewhere dangerous, please just say the word.\"\nBut a dark and insidious desire squirmed in the eyes of the spirited Ouyang Mun.",

    "content": "Chapter 182: Career Path (7)\nRight after that chaotic first meeting ended, Dam Bin gave Jeong Hyeon and Ju Seo-yeon a stern warning with a serious expression.\n“Though you may be serving the Eighth Young Master now, you must be aware that you could one day be serving the future Lord of Ten Thousand Demons. There must be absolutely no mistake when serving the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons. You need to start practicing for that from now on.\"\nWith those words, the Hidden Guard Pavilion's four-person team began their full-scale servant training program.\n\"You must put your heart and soul into everything. Laundry is no different. Imagine if the Supreme One were to wear clothes you had washed improperly. How dreadful an incident would that be?”\nAfter Dam Bin finished speaking, she turned to look at Jin Hayeon who immediately took the lead by demonstrating proper laundry techniques.\nAs she washed the clothes with an expressionless face, Jin Hayeon spat out a warning of her own.\n\"Young Master Il-mok is particularly sensitive about hygiene due to the side effects of his Demonic Art, so you must make everything extra clean.\"\nFollowing that, Jeong Hyeon and Ju Seo-yeon spent time learning about simple cleaning, organizing the house, sewing, and were given time to try the tasks themselves.\nWatching this scene from a distance, an odd feeling struck him.\n‘It’s like some kind of bride-training class.’\nFrom that perspective, Ju Seo-yeon and Jeong Hyeon didn't exactly seem like ideal bride material.\nFirst, there was Ju Seo-yeon's case.\nShe'd start following Jin Hayeon's demonstration, but her attention would then wander almost immediately.\nShe'd be washing Il-mok's clothes when suddenly she'd turn to look at Jin Hayeon with a dopey grin on her face.\nRiiip.\nThanks to that, she'd lose control of her strength and tear Il-mok's clothes.\nOr while sewing, she'd turn to stare at Jin Hayeon and—\nPrick.\nShe'd stab her own finger, drawing blood.\nIf it weren't for her having saved Il-mok's life, he probably would've kicked Ju Seo-yeon out that very day.\n\"Sigh.\"\nEventually, Jin Hayeon let out a light sigh and pulled out some healing ointment to apply to Ju Seo-yeon's finger.\nNaturally, Ju Seo-yeon's lips curved into another dopey smile.\nShe'd come for bridal training, but she seemed more interested in the instructor than her future husband.\nIt was like watching a student who only went to school because of a handsome teacher.\nThen there was Jeong Hyeon's case.\n\"Eep!\"\nShe would recoil in shock if Dam Bin or Jin Hayeon so much as drew a little close to explain the details of a chore.\nIl-mok watched this scene for a moment before losing interest and drawing his sword with a light sigh.\n\"Whew.\"\nIt was a sigh meant to shake off his tension.\nHe might have started overcoming Extremity, but that literally just meant he'd barely begun to escape it.\nAnother self was still coiled up deep in his mind, constantly looking for a chance to take over his body.\nEven so, the reason Il-mok willingly drew his sword was simple.\nThings were different now compared to the past.\nInstead of side effects getting worse as his skills improved, now he could be freed from his mental illness as he gained more insights.\nThe only risk was that he could still get totally taken over by that crazy son of a bitch while he was practicing to get better.\n—Show me!\n—That single sword strike from that day!\n'Shut the fuck up.'\nIl-mok cursed at the other ego in his mind and began his sword practice.\nHe was just a greenhorn who'd barely graduated from the Hall of the Demonic Way. At eighteen, he was too young to even be called a rising star of the new generation.\nAnd yet, his sword dance held the seasoned skill of a veteran of a hundred battles with countless insights melted into his every move.\nWhile Il-mok could afford to disregard the attendants' training, Dam Bin, as their supervisor, had no such luxury.\nRealizing that the two new recruits they'd accepted based on their merit of saving Il-mok were in absolutely terrible condition, Dam Bin let out a light sigh and turned her head to the side.\nThere, a guest who'd arrived at some unknown time was sitting there.\nA young lady boasting red nails, red hair, and red eyes was somehow doing needlework alongside Jeong Hyeon.\nAnd doing it perfectly, at that.\nThe sight of a young lady who was not only a direct descendant of the Hyeokryeon Family but also the current Family Head's only granddaughter doing needlework was strange in many ways.\n\"It seems Lady Hyeokryeon has experience with needlework.\"\nSeon-ah, who'd been absorbed in her sewing, looked up with a serene smile.\n\"I've been preparing in advance.\"\nAs she answered, Seon-ah's gaze had already turned toward Il-mok who was swinging his sword.\nShe'd come to Windrock Palace, but since Il-mok was focused on training, she was spending time with the others for now.\nHyeokryeon Seon-ah's stare made Dam Bin recall some information.\n'If I’m not wrong, the Eighth Young Master was supposedly close with that young lady before entering the Hall of the Demonic Way.' ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ nοvelfire.net\nShe wondered if the young lady might join the Hidden Guard Pavilion after she graduated from the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nHer goal would be serving the Eighth Young Master rather than the Heavenly Demon, so it would be for rather disloyal reasons, but Dam Bin decided to ignore it for now.\nEither way, having a talented subordinate join was a good thing.\n\"Needlework helps calm the mind.\"\n\"Eep!\"\nThe sight of Hyeokryeon Seon-ah teaching the three-year-old Jeong Hyeon needlework brought a strange expression to Dam Bin’s face.\nShe turned her gaze elsewhere, toward where Ju Seo-yeon and Jin Hayeon had been doing needlework.\nThere, for some reason she could not fathom, another man had somehow mixed into their group.\nOuyang Mun was doing needlework with a perfection that made Ju Seo-yeon look incompetent by comparison.\nThough he was from the Ouyang Family, his time as a combat unit member had naturally made him skilled at sewing.\nEspecially since he was naturally gifted with his hands, he had quite the talent for needlework and other household tasks.\nAfter doing such excellent needlework for a while...\nOuyang Mun began looking around before suddenly pricking his own finger with the needle.\n\"Ugh.\"\nThen, in a manner very unbefitting of a Demonic Cult warrior, he let out a groan that was way too dramatic for such a small wound and looked at Jin Hayeon with puppy eyes.\nIt was as if he were asking her to apply the wound salve for him, just as she had for Ju Seo-yeon.\n\"Tsk.\"\nJin Hayeon clicked her tongue while looking at Ouyang Mun like he was some kind of bug, then threw the entire bottle of healing ointment at him.\nCaptivated by Jin Hayeon’s mannerisms, Ju Seo-yeon dropped the clothes she'd been sewing onto the floor and dirtied them in the process.\nAfter confirming all of this, a deep sigh escaped Dam Bin's lips.\n'I'm really not sure if bringing those two into the Hidden Guard Pavilion was the right decision.'\nThe fact that they were being outshone by Hyeokryeon Seon-ah and Ouyang Mun of all people was giving her a throbbing headache.\nIl-mok was too busy training and fighting his other ego to notice all the dramas at Windrock Palace.\nHe moved his sword in a state of trance for quite a while until his reserves of internal energy were exhausted. With a deep exhale, he sat cross-legged and started meditation.\nHis time in the Meditation Club had evidently served him well; he sank into a profound state of inner awareness almost immediately and operated his cultivation art to replenish his depleted dantian.\nWhat greeted him when he opened his eyes was six figures who had somehow taken protective stances around him.\n'When did Seon-ah get here?'\nWhile Il-mok was wondering about discovering Hyeokryeon Seon-ah so late...\n\"Big brother!\"\nHyeokryeon Seon-ah called out with a radiant smile.\n\"Will you spare with me?\"\nHer way of speaking was completely different from before he entered the Hall of the Demonic Way. She seemed to want to emphasize that she was no longer a child, but to Il-mok, she just looked like a kid trying to act grown-up, which he found nothing but cute.\nSeeing his cute little sister like this, Il-mok smiled lightly and answered.\n\"I am curious to see how much you've improved in these two years.\"\nSince he needed to move toward Transcendence anyway, Il-mok had no reason to avoid the spar.\nAs soon as Il-mok gave his permission, Seon-ah took her combat stance, and those who'd been standing guard stepped far back.\nIl-mok just stood there looking relaxed, his sword down, and spoke leisurely. \"Come at me.\"\nHyeokryeon Seon-ah felt a strange sensation.\nHis posture looked full of openings, but for some reason, her instincts were warning her of danger.\nAfter hesitating for a moment, Seon-ah finally charged in boldly with a battle cry.\n\"Hyaa!\"\nShe knew that nothing would change by simply remaining in a standoff.\nUsing her lightness skill to close the distance instantly, Hyeokryeon Seon-ah thrust her qi-coated left hand like a dagger.\n'Hmm. She's grown quite a bit compared to two years ago.'\nIl-mok thought casually as he dodged the attack as if he were evaluating her performance.\nIt wasn't just her martial arts. Having gone through puberty over the past two years, her height and limbs had grown longer and expanded her reach.\nIt was like watching a kid who used to toddle around now taking long strides as she ran.\nAfter dodging Hyeokryeon Seon-ah's Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art with footwork or lightly deflecting it with his sword several times...\nClang.\nHe trapped her in his rhythm and his sword stopped right in front of her throat.\n“You’ve changed so much I almost can’t recognize you. You're at a level where you could take the top seat if you entered the Hall of the Demonic Way right now.\"\nIt wasn't an exaggeration. Seon-ah's current level was similar to that of Dokgo Pae or Cheon Su-ryong when they first entered the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nHyeokryeon Seol-ah smiled brightly at Il-mok’s praise. She didn't seem to care at all that she had been defeated so effortlessly.\n\"Will you spar with me just once more? I feel like I might grasp something. Big brother.\"\nSeon-ah, who wanted to play with Il-mok more, used the excuse of gaining insights, but Il-mok wasn't fooled.\n“There is wisdom in the saying, ‘too much is no better than too little.’ Do not let impatience guide you, especially not with Demonic Arts. That impatience tends to bring disaster.\"\nComing from one who had intimately known the torment of such side effects, it was profoundly valuable counsel.\n—More! Swing it more!\nBecause right at that moment, a psycho was having a meltdown in his head.\nThe next day, the Hidden Guard Pavilion's four-person team and Hyeokryeon Seon-ah came to Windrock Palace as usual.\nTo be precise, the Hidden Guard Pavilion's four-person team had started living at Windrock Palace while Hyeokryeon Seon-ah was visiting as a guest.\nAnd in the afternoon, that pitiful fellow Ouyang Mun came with his sworn brother, who was basically a paranoid patient.\n\"Youngest, congratulations on graduating from the Hall of the Demonic Way.\"\n\"I greet the Eighth Young Master!\"\nHiding his inner thoughts of Ouyang Mun, Il-mok bowed to Seo Wan-pyeong while Ouyang Mun did the same.\n\"I greet Third Brother.\"\n\"I wanted to visit from the day of my little brother's graduation ceremony, but I had a mission and could only come now.\"\n\"Just coming to visit is more than enough. Third Brother.\"\n\"Haha. Of course, I had to come now that my little brother has graduated from the Hall. Besides, I am also here because our Master has given an order.”\n\"What did Master say?\"\nSeo Wan-pyeong replied to Il-mok’s question.\n“He said that five days from now, you are to head for Gulang County in Gansu Province.”\nAt his Third Brother's message, Il-mok struggled to manage his expression.\n'Finally!!'\nIl-mok tried really hard not to smile lest they get the wrong idea.\nSeeing Il-mok's serious expression, Seo Wan-pyeong spoke with a proud look.\n\"That's my little brother, alright. To think you would take on a solo mission the moment you graduate from the Hall of the Demonic Way. And to the Central Plains, no less.”\n“Hahaha! One could talk about Young Master Il-mok’s excellence until one’s mouth hurt, and it still wouldn’t be enough, brother!”\nPrompted by Ouyang Mun’s cheer, Seo Wan-pyeong suddenly said something out of the blue.\n\"Oh, that reminded me, I heard the rumors, little brother. Hahaha. Never thought you were already thinking about getting married.”\nA storm raged in the eyes of all the women in Windrock Palace.",

    "content": "Chapter 183: The Way (1)\nHowever, the change in the women’s expressions was nothing compared to Il-mok’s.\n\"Wh-what are you talking about?\"\nIl-mok had never even uttered the word \"marriage\" in his entire life, let alone thought about it seriously.\n\"Hmm? Didn't you say you considered a woman around twenty as a marriage partner? I heard this from our Eldest Brother on the way back from a mission.\"\n\"...I did say something like that, but I didn't mean I was planning to get married right away, Third Brother.\"\nIl-mok never imagined that a casual conversation would get twisted into this mess.\nHearing Il-mok's explanation, Seo Wan-pyeong just smiled with that \"I knew it\" expression.\n\"Hahaha. That's our youngest for you. So cautious even when it comes to marriage.\"\nSeo Wan-pyeong interpreted Il-mok's words to mean he'd want to consider age first, then carefully weigh all the other conditions.\n\"You know, our youngest might end up being the first among us brothers to tie the knot. I'm still way too lacking, and while our Eldest Brother has already achieved Transcendence, he said he wants to focus on the Demon-Teaching Pavilion's affairs and prepare for the future first.\"\nWhile Seo Wan-pyeong rambled on with his unnecessary commentary, everyone caught in the blast of his bombshell was lost in their own thoughts.\nJu Seo-yeon didn't care about Il-mok's love life, so she wasn't thinking about anything.\n'Interesting. I'll need to keep this in mind when serving the Eighth Young Master in the future.'\nAs the First Squad Leader of the Hidden Guard Pavilion, Dam Bin treated Seo Wan-pyeong's words as 'intelligence' and filed them away in her mind.\n'Tw-twenty years old... since I'm eighteen now, that means in two years... What am I thinking right now?!’\nJeong Hyeon found herself imagining weird scenarios and hung her head, blushing furiously from embarrassment.\n'So the Young Master likes women around twenty. Come to think of it, I was nineteen two years ago.'\nJin Hayeon pretended not to care much, but she couldn't help recalling her own age.\n'Five years.'\nFor some reason, Hyeokryeon Seon-ah was holding up her left hand and folding down her fingers one by one.\n'If I can just keep everyone away for five more years...'\nWith each finger she folded, the murderous aura radiating from her grew thicker.\nFive days flew by quickly once the trip to the Central Plains was confirmed.\nJin Hayeon and Dam Bin continued to train Ju Seo-yeon and Jeong Hyeon while attending to Il-mok, and Il-mok spent his time either immersed in his training or receiving guests who came to Windrock Palace.\nThe Hyeokryeon Family was doing much the same.\nActually, they seemed to be in an even more harmonious mood.\nThis was all thanks to the atmosphere that Young Lord Hyeokryeon Hwan subtly gave off.\n‘Huhuhu. That lecher is finally leaving.’\nWord had quietly spread that the Eighth Young Master would soon be leaving the main headquarters for a secret mission.\nThose who had been trying to recruit him were either sick with disappointment or desperately searching for some way around it, but for Hyeokryeon Hwan, this was nothing but delightful news.\nAnd on the day Il-mok was supposed to leave, around lunchtime...\n\"Hmm...?\"\nAfter the morning greetings, Seon-ah always came by at this time to have lunch with her parents, but she was nowhere to be seen.\nSensing something ominous, Hyeokryeon Hwan shot up from his seat, and his wife, Lady Cheonghwa, felt the same way.\nThey rushed over and soon arrived at the building where Hyeokryeon Seon-ah lived, and Hyeokryeon Hwan's anxiety peaked.\nFor some reason, the lock that was always there had been unlocked.\nHyeokryeon Hwan and Lady Cheonghwa looked at each other, nodded, and entered the room. In the center of the room lay a letter.\nHyeokryeon Hwan strode over, picked up the letter, and began reading.\nWhen Hyeokryeon Hwan stood there holding the letter, Lady Cheonghwa felt uneasy and cautiously approached.\nOnly then did she realize what had happened.\nHer husband had frozen solid while standing.\nLady Cheonghwa deliberately looked away from her husband and turned her gaze toward the letter their daughter had left behind.\nThe letter's contents weren't very long.\nIt was basically a runaway declaration.\n\"Sigh.\"\nLady Cheonghwa, who had somehow sensed this might happen, sighed softly and shook her husband out of his stupor.\n\"Husband. Pull yourself together.\"\nSnapping out of his daze at his wife's call, Hyeokryeon Hwan frantically shouted.\n\"You're right, my dear! This isn't the time to be spacing out. I need to go find that damn womanizer right now and bring our daughter back!\"\n\"Sigh... It's already too late. The Eighth Young Master left the main headquarters at least two hours ago. Moreover, she clearly stated in the letter that she’ll return for her time in the Hall of the Demonic Way.”\nLady Cheonghwa pointed to the letter Seon-ah had left behind.\nThis was the main reason she was accepting Seon-ah's running away.\nIt wasn't about the part where she said she would return before entering the Hall of the Demonic Way. Rather, it was because of her daughter’s side effects.\n'After entering the Hall of the Demonic Way, she won't be able to see the Eighth Young Master again for another two years. She already seemed to have reached her limit after being apart for the past two years, so it might be better to let them be together for just a few months.'\nHowever, the answer that came from Hyeokryeon Hwan’s mouth was something that even Lady Cheonghwa had not anticipated.\n\"What are you talking about, dear? Seon-ah won't be entering the Hall of the Demonic Way!\"\n\"What do you mean? Don't tell me you're planning to send her to the Hall of the Demonic Way when she turns eighteen in three years?\"\nLady Cheonghwa was thinking of the newly reorganized education system of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nThe system that would delay the start of Demonic Arts training to sixteen and naturally push back the Hall of the Demonic Way entrance to eighteen was scheduled to be implemented in a few years.\nBut that system was only for young children who hadn't started learning Demonic Arts yet.\nHer daughter, who had begun learning Demonic Art around age ten, wasn't part of that group.\nAnd Hyeokryeon Hwan wasn't referring to that system either.\n\"Thanks to the Family Head, I already couldn't see my daughter for three and a half years! And now you want us to be separated for another two years? What kind of horrible thing is that to say! No way! She’s not going anywhere until she’s thirty!”\n\"......\"\nAt the doting father’s declaration, Lady Cheonghwa felt doubt for the first time.\nDoubt about whether she had made a mistake marrying this man.\nMaybe it was because of her existential crisis.\n\"Urgh.\"\nShe suddenly felt a strange wave of nausea.\n\"My dear!!\"\nSeeing his wife's condition, Hyeokryeon Hwan's face went pale.\nLady Cheonghwa was also a woman who had learned Demonic Arts as a member of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, only stopping her training after conceiving their first child, Seon-ah.\nHyeokryeon Hwan was convinced that his daughter's running away had triggered Qi Deviation in his wife.\n'That damn Eighth Young Master!!'\nThinking this was also Il-mok's fault, Hyeokryeon Hwan quickly carried his wife and rushed toward the medical quarters.\nSeeing Hyeokryeon Hwan's pale complexion and Lady Cheonghwa in his arms, the physicians quickly brought Lady Cheonghwa inside.\nAfter waiting tensely in one corner of the medical quarters for a while...\nThe door opened and one of the physicians came out to approach Hyeokryeon Hwan.\n\"Is my wife alright?!\"\nThe physician smiled and answered.\n\"Congratulations, Young Lord Hyeokryeon. Your wife is expecting your second child.\"\nIt had been about a month since Hyeokryeon Hwan finished his closed-door training.\nAnd since they hadn't seen each other in three and a half years, they'd been... busy.\nNews of Lady Cheonghwa's pregnancy spread quickly, and the Hyeokryeon Family was in an uproar. The child is the direct line of the current Family Head, and more importantly, this was a blessing that came fifteen years after their first child, Seon-ah.\nEveryone in the Hyeokryeon family was on high alert regarding Lady Cheonghwa's wellbeing.\nSince it was her first pregnancy in fifteen years, her safety was more important than anything else so much so that the matter of Seon-ah's running away was completely overshadowed.\nMeanwhile...\nIl-mok, who had no idea what was happening at the main headquarters, looked at Seon-ah traveling beside him.\nShe was smiling with a look of pure happiness on her face.\n'That Young Lord gave permission for her to come along...'\nThat is what Hyeokryeon Seon-ah said when she came to find Il-mok early in the morning as he was preparing to leave the main headquarters.\nOf course, Il-mok hadn’t believed her. It was just that…\n‘She did say it was only until she had to enter the Hall of the Demonic Way…’\nThe kid's eyes had looked so desperate. Now their roles were reversed; soon she would be the one confined within the academy, unable to communicate with the outside world for two long years. Dıscover more novels at novel(ꜰ)ire.net\nBut this was only Il-mok's perspective.\nIl-mok turned his head to look at Dam Bin.\nWhile he technically held the highest position, in many ways, she could be considered the person in charge of this journey.\nAs a Squad Leader of the Hidden Guard Pavilion, she was responsible for assisting and protecting him.\nIl-mok couldn't understand why she had accepted Hyeokryeon Seon-ah's lie.\nAnd why had she also accepted that fellow as well.\n\"Hahaha! Just trust me, Hayeon! Thanks to my time in the combat unit, I now know Xinjiang like the back of my hand!\"\nOuyang Mun was shouting confidently, but somehow, his words didn't inspire any confidence at all.\nWhat’s more absurd is that Ouyang Mun joined this group as a member of the Hidden Guard Pavilion.\nThis crazy bastard had defected from the White Tortoise Corps and transferred to the Hidden Guard Pavilion.\nHe could guess why Dam Bin had accepted Ouyang Mun and Hyeokryeon Seon-ah into the group.\nLike other organizations in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, the Hidden Guard Pavilion was desperate for talent, and both Hyeokryeon Seon-ah and Ouyang Mun definitely had the skills.\nEspecially since both of them were better than her actual trainees.\nSo even though they both had some personality issues, Dam Bin didn't care.\nAfter all, finding someone with a normal personality among those living in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's main headquarters was like trying to find a needle dropped in the Xinjiang wasteland.\nOuyang Mun pestered Jin Hayeon enthusiastically.\n\"If we go just half an hour more from here, there's a small oasis where we can rest!\"\nAnd sneakily glanced over at Il-mok.\nThe biggest reason he had gone so far as to move from the White Tortoise Corps to the Hidden Guard Pavilion was because of Il-mok.\nHe was deeply impressed by Il-mok's talent and wanted to serve him.\nThis was, of course, complete bullshit.\nOuyang Mun may have acknowledged Il-mok’s talent, but he had no intention of living his life serving someone else.\nThe first reason he transferred to the Hidden Guard Pavilion was Ju Seo-yeon's case.\nHe had witnessed with his own eyes that getting seriously injured while trying to save Il-mok could lead to being embraced by Jin Hayeon, so he strived to take the chance.\nThe second reason was due to a sense of crisis.\n'At this rate, Master might steal Hayeon away from me!'\nThe \"Master\" Ouyang Mun referred to was Il-mok.\nWhen his sworn brother mentioned the topic of marriage, Ouyang Mun’s obsessive gaze was fixed upon Jin Hayeon. He had not failed to notice the subtle change in her expression when Il-mok mentioned his age preference.\nMaster claimed to have no romantic interest in her, but the human heart is a fickle thing! Who knows what might happen between those two while I'm not around!'\nHe was completely oblivious to the fact that he still had zero chance with her even if he stayed by her side constantly.\nOr maybe he just doesn’t want to acknowledge that.\nIl-mok briefly observed the pitiful girl and the pathetic young man who had suddenly joined their group, then sighed softly.\nAnd so, a modest group of seven was formed.\nIl-mok and Dam Bin. Jin Hayeon and Ju Seo-yeon, Ouyang Mun. Jeong Hyeon and Hyeokryeon Seon-ah.\nOriginally, a different configuration could have been created, but Il-mok’s influence had played a large part.\n'One supervisor like Dam Bin is enough.'\nWhat was his reason for heading to the Central Plains again? For Il-mok who was dreaming of a carefree life, having another eye from the Hidden Guard Pavilion accompany him would be inconvenient in many ways.\n'I'll need to train to reach Transcendence, but I hate people breathing down my neck.’\nSo, he rode off with his new crew.\nBut as he dreamed of his comfy future, an ominous premonition settled in his heart.\n'It can't be, right?'\nThey left the main base, went through the awful Xinjiang desert, passed the border gate, and then traveled the roads in Gansu for a few days. After more than ten days of riding horses and using their lightness skill, they finally reached Gulang County in Gansu Province.\nJust one more step and he’ll welcome his long-awaited carefree life.\nThat’s when the Branch Leader of Gulang County welcomed him.\n\"Please, you have to stop Young Master Baek Cheon!\"\nHearing that, Il-mok squeezed his eyes shut.",

    "content": "Chapter 184: The Way (2)\nSeeing Il-mok’s negative reaction, the listening Jin Hayeon beside him voiced her question.\n\"Is there some problem with Young Master Baek Cheon?\"\n\"There's a serious problem.\"\nIl-mok added with a deep sigh.\n\"The guy's completely insane.\"\n\"......\"\nThe scathing words coming out of Il-mok made Dam Bin and Jin Hayeon look at him with strange expressions.\n'Even the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons admired Young Master Baek Cheon's ambition, so what's this about...'\n'I heard that the head of the Baek Family was delighted because of the advice our young master gave to Young Master Baek Cheon.'\nThe rumors they'd heard and Il-mok's reaction didn't match up at all.\nBut somehow, Dam Bin and Jin Hayeon felt like Il-mok's words rang true.\nAnd with good reason. The Branch Leader of Gulang County was enthusiastically nodding his head at Il-mok’s scathing criticism.\nAs if that wasn’t enough, Jeong Hyeon also smiled awkwardly and gave a look of affirmation.\nIl-mok turned to the Branch Leader and asked, \"So what kind of trouble has that lunatic caused now?\"\n\"He's been nothing but trouble from start to finish. It's been about a month since Young Master Baek Cheon arrived here, but I haven't seen him act normal even once, Eighth Young Master.\"\nThe Branch Leader's answer gave Il-mok a strange sense of unease, and he frowned, \"A month? What do you mean by that? It's been about a year since Senior Baek Cheon left for the Central Plains.\"\n“It’s because he was kicked out of the other branches.”\n\"......\"\nEven as Il-mok was momentarily at a loss for words, the Branch Leader’s complaints continued. \"He kept pulling the same attention-grabbing stunts at every county he visited, so he got kicked out of all of them before lasting even three months. Especially in Chengdu, I heard the entire branch nearly got wiped out because of Young Master Baek Cheon.\"\n\"What the hell did he do to cause such a disaster?\"\n\"Apparently, he was running around saying he had to put on a play. And in Chengdu, he was making a fuss about learning face-changing opera, which caught the Sichuan Tang Family's attention. As if that wasn’t enough, he then supposedly picked a fight with them, calling the Tang Family’s hidden weapon techniques fake…”\nIl-mok squeezed his eyes shut again.\n'I did tell him to study theater in the Central Plains, but this madman actually went and…’\nThe Central Plains is basically an enemy territory for everyone from the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nThe cult members in Central Plains branches were essentially spies, and naturally had to keep their identities hidden.\nBut Baek Cheon, being the attention-whore he was, hadn't done that.\nTrue to his Demonic Art’s nature, he'd completely abandoned his duties as a spy.\nNow, even Dam Bin seemed to understand what kind of person Baek Cheon was and wore an expression of disbelief.\nJin Hayeon, on the other hand, still maintained her flat face thanks to her White Hand Demonic Art. She just frowned for a bit and asked, \"Why didn't you try to stop him?\"\n“He doesn’t listen to a single word I say. It was the same at the other branches. That's how he ended up getting kicked out all the way here.\"\nWhile Gansu Province wasn't as remote as Xinjiang, it was still pretty much the backwater of the Central Plains.\nThanks to his family background, Baek Cheon was initially assigned to a more central location in the Central Plains.\nBut after causing trouble each time, he'd eventually been pushed out to this backwater among backwaters. While Il-mok was thinking this, Jin Hayeon asked another question:\n\"Then why don't you kick him out somewhere else like the other branches did?\"\n“As it happens, I have already sent a message to the main headquarters just like the other Branch Leaders did.\"\nAt that answer, Il-mok felt an ominous premonition.\n\"When exactly did you send that message?\"\n\"It was about the third day after Young Master Baek Cheon arrived.\"\n\"Then that message would have reached headquarters roughly two weeks ago.\"\n\"That's correct.\"\nOnly then did Il-mok realize.\nWhy had he been specifically sent to this backwater place called Gulang County.\nAnd why his master had suddenly arranged his schedule to send him out quickly.\n'It was because of this crazy attention-seeker!!'\nHis master must have sent him here to deal with Baek Cheon.\nAnd Baek Cheon's ridiculous attempts at making plays were one way or another because of him.\nRealizing that all of this was his karma, Il-mok let out a deep sigh.\n\"So where is that lunatic right now?\"\nIl-mok and his group followed the Branch Leader out onto the streets of Gulang County.\nAfter walking along the main road for a while, they soon reached Gulang County's marketplace.\nEven without the Branch Leader saying anything, Il-mok and his companions had no trouble finding Baek Cheon.\nGansu Province was close to the backwater of the Central Plains, and Gulang County wasn't the capital or a major county within Gansu.\nSince it wasn't a big county, there weren't that many people coming and going in the marketplace, so finding Baek Cheon wasn't difficult.\nActually, even if the place had been crawling with people, it would have been easy to find him.\nIt was to the point that even Dam Bin and Jin Hayeon, who'd never met Baek Cheon before, and Hyeokryeon Seon-ah and Ouyang Mun, spotted him easily.\n\"Today I shall show you all a play about a truly great person!\"\nThere was the lunatic, yelling at the top of his lungs while channeling his internal energy.\nn just one month since being assigned to the Gulang County branch, he'd apparently become something of a local attraction, with quite a crowd gathered around him.\nWatching Baek Cheon wave his fan around dramatically while speaking exaggeratedly, Il-mok let out a deep sigh, \"Miss Jeong.\"\n\"Y-yes, Young Master.\"\nThe moment Jeong Hyeon’s stutter reached his ears, Il-mok pointed at Baek Cheon and said, \"Please shoot that bastard with your bow.\"\n“D-do you mean I should hit his acupoints to subdue him?”\nIl-mok shook his head at Jeong Hyeon’s reply.\n\"Just stick it right in his forehead.\"\n“B-but he’ll die if I do that, Y-Young Master.”\n“And wouldn’t that be more helpful for the Branch Leader here, our Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, and my own peace and well-being?”\n\"......\"\nJeong Hyeon couldn't bring herself to say anything in reply, all the more so because his argument is valid.\nSensing the gazes of everyone except Jeong Hyeon and the Branch Leader were getting strange, Il-mok cleared his throat once.\n\"Ahem. That was a joke.\"\nWhile Il-mok was regretting missing the chance to assassinate Baek Cheon:\n\"Young Master Il-mok!!\"\nBaek Cheon finally spotted Il-mok through the crowd and shouted.\n\"That crazy bastard really...\"\nFinding himself now also attracting the eyes of the crowd, Il-mok muttered a curse to himself and stepped forward.\n\"Hahaha. Long time no see!\"\nAs Il-mok approached the lunatic with a smile, the crowd that had been watching Gulang County's local attraction spread out wide to make way.\nWhile an attention-seeker makes for a fine spectacle, it seemed they had no desire to associate with one, nor with his acquaintances.\nThanks to that, Il-mok easily approached Baek Cheon's side and sent a telepathic message along with his greeting:\n“So this is where you were.”\n—I have an important matter we must discuss in private. Please come with me for a moment to a place where there are no people.\nBut Baek Cheon was as clueless as ever.\n\"Hahaha! I was just about to start my play. Since this is also thanks to Young Master Il-mok's advice, how about we have our conversation after you see the results of this past year!\"\nIl-mok kept his fake smile plastered on his face while gritting his teeth and sending another telepathic message.\n—It’s an important story related to that play. How about you do the play after hearing what I have to say?\nThe mention of it being about the play seemed to work as Baek Cheon nodded with a smile.\n\"Then let's go together! Hahaha!\"\nBaek Cheon strode off with a hearty laugh, and the people who didn't want to catch his attention-seeking disease made way widely.\nThanks to that, they easily reached a deserted alley.\nBaek Cheon looked at Il-mok with a face full of anticipation. \"What's this about the play, Young Master Il-mok! If it's advice from you, I'll listen with all my attention anytime!\"\nThe response to that thrust was Il-mok’s sweet smile.\n\"First, let's start with you getting your ass kicked.\"\n\"???\"\nIl-mok instantly lunged toward Baek Cheon.\nFollowing the principles of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword that had now become completely ingrained in his body, Il-mok's sword flashed toward Baek Cheon.\nOf course, Baek Cheon was also a talent who had completed the Hall of the Demonic Way and was a direct lineage from one of the Five Great Families, so even while flustered, he reacted to the surprise attack by stepping back with footwork while swinging his sleeve to shoot hidden weapons.\nHowever.\nClang!\nIl-mok casually deflected the hidden weapons Baek Cheon had shot like he was swatting away flies.\nHis speed in charging toward Baek Cheon didn't decrease at all, and his sword had closed the distance in an instant, piercing Baek Cheon's pressure points.\n\"Ugh.\"\nIl-mok's demonic energy flowed through the Sword Qi that had reached the pressure points and suppressed Baek Cheon's blood flow.\nWith his body completely stiffened, Baek Cheon could only watch as Il-mok smiled refreshingly and swung his left fist.\nThwack!!\nOn a bright day, in a quiet alley in Gulang County, the sound of something getting pounded echoed repeatedly.\nAfter refreshingly venting his anger, Il-mok returned to the branch carrying Baek Cheon over his shoulder.\nLooking at Baek Cheon, whose face had turned all sorts of colors, Il-mok asked.\n\"Have you forgotten what you're supposed to do at a Central Plains branch?\"\n\"I know what it is. Collect information from the Central Plains, right?\"\nBaek Cheon's confident answer was met with an incredulous look from Il-mok.\n\"Then why the hell did you act so conspicuously?\"\n“Gathering intelligence on the Central Plains is important, but recruiting new cult members in the Central Plains is also important! To do that, we spread the greatness of our cult far and wide!\"\nBaek Cheon felt wronged and argued.\n\"And wasn't this what Young Master Il-mok taught me! You told me to create plays about the greatness of past Heavenly Demons and spread our cult's grand intentions!\"\nThe content of Baek Cheon's argument shifted everyone's attention to Il-mok.\nThe Branch Leader's eyes were full of resentment. His expression seemed to say, \"So you were the root cause of all this?\"\nBut not everyone reacted that way.\n“So there was such a profound meaning behind it!! As expected of Young Master Il-mok!”\nFor some reason, Ouyang Mun had a moved expression on his face.\n\"While Young Master Baek Cheon's actions were excessive, his intentions seem truly admirable.\"\nDam Bin and Jin Hayeon also showed a somewhat peculiar reaction.\nAt those bizarre responses, Il-mok sighed and said:\n\"I agree that spreading the faith is important. But since this is the Central Plains, shouldn't we at least hide the cult's name while proselytizing?\"\n\"How would we do that?\"\nWhen Baek Cheon asked that, most people looked at Il-mok with eyes full of trust and interest.\nIt was because of the things they had either heard through rumors or experienced for themselves.\nTheir gazes seemed to expect that if anyone could find a solution to any difficult problem, it would be the Eighth Young Master. ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ NoveI★Fire.net\nOf course, Il-mok had just said whatever came to mind.\n‘Did these nutjobs really just entrust the solution to me?’\nIl-mok was about to let out a hollow laugh at the absurdity when something suddenly occurred to him.\n'Wait a minute. The Heavenly Demon Divine Cult is a cult anyway, right?'\nThat evening.\nUnder a sky being painted with the light of the setting sun, a few outsiders approached the residents of Gulang County, who were busily moving about to wrap up their day.\nA man who was relatively normal except for when he was in front of Jin Hayeon smiled cheerfully and struck up a conversation.\n\"Miss, you have such a benevolent aura flowing from your face. You seem to have been born with good fortune.\"\n\"M-me?\"\nAs the woman hesitated and asked back at the sudden praise from a stranger, Ju Seo-yeon who was beside Ouyang Mun made her clear eyes sparkle as she said, \"That's right. By any chance, have you heard about the Way (道)?\"",

    "content": "Chapter 185: Maitreya Luminous Cult (1)\nOuyang Mun and Ju Seo-yeon weren't the only ones out there doing missionary work. Jin Hayeon was paired up with Hyeokryeon Seon-ah.\nIt was Il-mok's way of being considerate by keeping Ju Seo-yeon and Ouyang Mun away from Jin Hayeon.\nJin Hayeon wandered around the marketplace and struck up a conversation with a young man.\n\"Excuse me, but I'm new to this area. Could you give me directions?\"\nThe moment she spoke, the passing young man stopped dead in his tracks and stared at her with a dazed expression.\nDespite her cold personality, Jin Hayeon was a beauty who could effortlessly catch the attention of anyone walking by.\n\"O-of course! I'd be happy to help!\"\nThe guy was practically bursting with enthusiasm as Jin Hayeon asked him.\n\"Could you tell me how to get to the Windstream Inn?\"\nThe Windstream Inn was the biggest inn in Gulang County, the kind of place anyone who'd lived here for even a few days would know about.\nBut even though she was asking about such a famous landmark, the guy didn't find it suspicious at all.\nAfter all, this gorgeous young lady had said she was new to Gulang County, and more importantly...\n‘A face like that could never tell a lie!’\nHis eyes were already glued to Jin Hayeon's face.\nThe guy happily led Jin Hayeon and Hyeokryeon Seon-ah to the Windstream Inn.\n\"Thank you so much, young hero.\"\n\"Hahaha. Y-young hero? That is far too grand a title for me.”\nAs the man laughed awkwardly and blushed, that's when Hyeokryeon Seon-ah stepped in.\n\"Since fate brought us together like this, how about we share some tea inside?\"\n\"My sister speaks the truth. You've been so kind to us, shouldn't we return the favor? The tea will be on us, so please, join us.”\nWhen they invited him for tea, the guy's mind was already painting rosy pictures of the future.\nThey went inside the inn and started with simple introductions before moving on to casual small talk.\n\"Hahaha!\"\nEven though they were just making pointless conversation, the guy's smile stretched from ear to ear.\nIt was almost dinner time, yet he seemed to have completely forgotten that his parents were waiting for him to eat with them at home.\n‘Mom! Dad! Just wait a little longer! Looks like I might be getting a wife soon! Maybe even two!’\nHe probably thought he was being a good son right now.\nWhile the guy was lost in his delusions, Jin Hayeon's smooth voice slipped into his ears.\n“By the way, Young Hero Park, do you happen to follow any particular religion?\" Follow current novels on novᴇlfire.net\nWhile the two pairs were doing their missionary work, Dam Bin was also operating independently.\nJust then, Jeong Hyeon sent a sound transmission to Il-mok/\n—Y-Young Master, are you s-sure it's okay to do missionary work like this?\nBecause Jeong Hyeon was prone to panic attacks if anyone came within ten paces of her, she'd been excluded from the missionary activities and was acting as Il-mok's bodyguard instead.\nAs Jeong Hyeon’s question implies, this entire method of recruitment was conceived by Il-mok.\nIt was a playbook he knew by heart, having been on the receiving end of it countless times in his past life.\nEverything from the classic old-school \"Do you know the Way?\" approach to asking for directions to famous landmarks as an excuse to start conversations.\n‘Too bad there aren't any universities here. I can't pull the whole \"I'm doing a college project and need to interview people\" bullshit.’\nThere were countless ways to approach random strangers.\nThanks to being burned by all those countless methods during his life as Seo Ji-hun, it had become second nature to simply ignore any stranger who tried to speak to him on the street.\nIt was to the point where he wondered if the reason the sense of communal warmth between people had vanished from the cities of South Korea might've been because of all those damn cults.\nAnd to put it another way…\n‘If these tactics worked in suspicious modern cities, there's no way they won't work in this medieval era.’\nJeong Hyeon's worries were completely pointless. If anything, he should be worried about things going too well.\nAfter the sun had completely set, Il-mok greeted the returning missionary team with a bright smile.\n\"Good work, everyone. Did you make sure to clearly state the time and place at the end?”\nThe five who'd been doing missionary work all gave positive responses to Il-mok's question.\n\"Then just bear with it for a few more days.\"\nIl-mok had no intention of keeping up this missionary approach.\nBecause of guilt?\nNot even close.\n‘If I keep pulling these stunts in such a small place, we'll stand out. I'm not Baek Cheon. I can't afford to do that.’\nGulang County wasn't a city; it was a small community with a finite number of faces and would quickly attract notice.\nWhat they'd done today was just laying groundwork.\nBuilding at least a minimal foundation for the real missionary work to come.\n\"Here's a simple form I prepared. Use this format to organize information about the potential converts you talked to today.\"\nThe form was nothing special; it was just their names, ages, hobbies, relationships, and personality traits they'd picked up during conversation.\nHowever, the information from this simple form would become a massive asset for future missionary activities.\nJin Hayeon looked down at the paper Il-mok handed her, then raised her head.\n\"I followed your instructions for now, Young Master, but I'm not sure if this approach is right.\"\n\"Even though this form looks simple, it'll be a huge asset later.\"\n\"I wasn't referring to the form. I was questioning whether it's right to pull people in through simple friendship rather than actually teaching them our doctrine.\"\nA few other thoughtful members seemed to share similar doubts as they too looked at Il-mok with skeptical eyes.\nThey seemed to feel that people who became believers just because of friendship rather than truly believing in the doctrine couldn't be trusted.\nWell, everyone besides Seon-ah and Baek Cheon.\nMeanwhile, Ouyang Mun and Ju Seo-yeon were staring at Jin Hayeon, who'd asked the question.\n\"Hmm.\"\nAfter scanning the crazy bunch, Il-mok looked at the ones he could actually have a logical conversation with. Which are Dam Bin, Jin Hayeon, and Jeong Hyeon.\n\"You need to think about this backwards. We’ve been exposed to our Divine Cult's great doctrine since childhood, but to the people of the Central Plains, our doctrine is unfamiliar. Hmm. Think of it like food, for example.\"\n\"Food?\"\n\"Right. Imagine someone served you a new dish from a foreign land instead of something you're used to eating. Something weird-looking that you've never seen before.\"\n\"Young Master, your analogy is problematic.\"\n“Are you suggesting that the doctrines of the Divine Cult are weird?\"\nWhen Dam Bin and Jin Hayeon pointed this out, Il-mok shook his head.\n\"At least to the people here, it might seem weird.\"\nTo be honest, it wasn’t just the locals; even Il-mok thought it was pretty weird.\n\"Anyway, how would you feel if a complete stranger from a foreign land tried to force you to eat that weird-looking food?\"\n“Like I was being poisoned.”\n\"Exactly right. On the flip side, what if people you knew or were close to were all eating that food together and enjoying it?\"\n“...You might be wary, but you’d also be curious, wouldn’t you?” Jin Hayeon answered, and the others started to understand Il-mok's intention.\nFor their benefit, Il-mok added.\n\"Also, this approach has another strength. One of the things humans find hardest to sever is precisely our human emotions. Unlike approaching people by revealing our religion from the start, if they've already become close to us and their friends and family belong to us... the potential converts won't be able to leave easily.\"\nIl-mok knew this from knowledge he'd picked up in the modern world.\nOne reason people who got tricked into joining cults couldn't leave even after realizing the truth was exactly this.\n\"Finally, we'll need to soften our doctrine when we first teach it. Like I said, to them, our doctrine is weird foreign food. Rather than forcing them to eat foreign food as-is, shouldn't we make it a bit more familiar to the local people?\"\n“In what way should we soften it?\"\nFor some reason, Il-mok’s gaze fell upon Jin Hayeon.\n\"I think we should borrow the method Miss Jin used to teach me in the past. We'll omit the title 'Heavenly Demon' and use the name Maitreya, teaching that Maitreya will come in the future to punish the wicked.\"\n“…Are you saying we should only reveal our true identity to those who later come to truly believe in our Divine Cult?”\nIl-mok nodded at Jin Hayeon’s question and spoke.\n\"Exactly. Until we reveal our identity, we won't be called the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. We'll operate under the name Maitreya Luminous Cult, in the sense that Maitreya will one day judge evil and reveal the light.”\nThe missionary work continued for two more days after that.\nThe five carried out missionary activities in different parts of Gulang County on different days, making contact and conversing with various people.\nFollowing Il-mok's orders not to be too conspicuous, they stopped the missionary activities after that, and two more days passed.\nOne evening, several people gathered toward the middle slope of a low mountain near Gulang County.\n\"Welcome.\"\n\"Thank you so much for keeping your promise.\"\nThe five who'd done missionary work for three days total came forward to greet each person they'd invited as they showed up.\nAgainst all odds, Jin Hayeon had brought in the largest number of potential converts despite being the most skeptical of this approach and the one who lacked social skills.\nBut Il-mok wasn't surprised by this.\n‘The laws of logic don't apply when you're that beautiful. A pretty face is its own plot armor.’\nEvery single guy who'd had even a brief conversation with her boasted perfect attendance.\n‘This is why men need to be most careful of honey traps.’\nHe conveniently ignored the fact that he had been the one to weaponize her beauty in the first place.\n\"Huh? What brings you here?\"\n\"Brother Jang, I should be asking you the same thing.”\nMaybe because Gulang County was small, there were many among the invited guests who knew one another.\nAnd mixed in among them was another arrangement Il-mok had prepared.\nThe martial artists from the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's Gulang County branch.\nThey'd been living here for at least several years, some for over a decade, so they were practically locals.\nThey could naturally melt into the crowd, pretending to know nothing, and help shape the atmosphere.\nThe people gathered in the small clearing had casual conversations under the moonlight.\nAt first, they exchanged brief greetings and small talk, but throughout the conversation, several people with assigned roles naturally brought up religious topics.\n\"We believe that in the future, Maitreya will come to punish all the wicked and open the way to a peaceful world.”\n\"Heaven's net may seem loose, but no evildoer will escape it.\"\nBut not everyone was fooled by this artificial atmosphere.\n\"What naive thinking. This is a world where trying to live righteously only gets you hurt.”\nAs the young man spoke in a sullen tone, a woman chimed in.\n\"That's right. If the wicked really get punished, why are those bastards still living just fine?\"\nJust as an unsettled mood began to spread because of their words...\nIl-mok, who had been watching from beyond the bushes while using his concealment arts, stepped forward.\nIl-mok had somewhat expected this.\nHe knew that sooner or later, their message of hope would crash against the rocks of reality.\nIn a world where evildoers ran rampant, saying that the wicked would be punished in the future was nothing but empty words.\nAnd here in Gulang County, there was a gang of criminals who'd made themselves at home.\nThe kind of bastards who extorted money by threatening people, engaged in loan-sharking as a daily business, and even coerced those who couldn’t repay their debts into selling their women as prostitutes.\n“Are the bastards you speak of the Red Serpent Gang?\"\nWhen Il-mok suddenly appeared from the bushes wearing a mask, everyone in the clearing turned their attention to him.\nThe reason Il-mok felt no guilt about using those damn missionary tactics he'd experienced in the modern world...\n...Was because of the Red Serpent Gang he'd learned about while getting explanations about Gulang County from the Branch Leader.\nIl-mok still thought of the Demonic Cult as a den of lunatics, but...\n‘The Demonic Cult might be full of crazy bastards, but they're not scumbags.’\nThey didn't pull the kind of evil shit you'd expect from cults, like sexual offerings.\nTheir only problem was the fact that they relied purely on force to achieve what they believed was right.\nThat’s why...\n“I am the Incarnation of Maitreya, sent forth into the mortal world before he cleanses it. Maitreya has decreed that there is a gathering of evil in Gulang County and commanded me to root them out to save the people.\"\nTonight, Il-mok planned to deliver justice for the people of Gulang County as payment for his missionary activities.\nThe Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's brand of salvation.",

    "content": "Chapter 186: Maitreya Luminous Cult (2)\nOn the outskirts of Gulang County, where only the faint moonlight settled.\nIn this pitch-black night, only one estate stood illuminated by torches—a compound bearing the nameplate \"Red Serpent Gang.\"\n\"Haaaaah.\"\nOne of the Red Serpent Gang’s men on watch yawned, prompting his companion to offer him the gourd hanging at his side.\n\"Here, drink some of this.\"\nThe guard brought the gourd to his nose, and the sharp smell of cheap rice wine hit his nostrils. But he didn't seem bothered by it; he gulped it down without hesitation.\n\"Ugh, damn it. Who the hell's gonna attack us in this backwater village? We're gonna freeze our asses off standing watch.\"\nHearing the complaint from the one who'd been drinking, his companion extended his hand as if asking for the gourd back.\n\"That's exactly why I brought this along. Without it, how could we stand living in such a miserable situation?\"\nThe guard who'd been drinking handed back the gourd, then glanced toward the inner courtyard of the estate. It wasn't because he was afraid of getting caught drinking and gossiping while on duty.\n\"That girl's got quite the pretty face, doesn't she?\"\nHis eyes gleamed with lustful desire.\n\"Heheh. That’s why the boss set up her moron of a father. She’ll fetch a fine price on the market.”\n\"Before we sell her for a good price, we should have some fun with her ourselves.\"\n“Get in line. We’ll get our turn once the boss has had his fill. He’ll toss her to us when he's done.”\nThe two continued their crude conversation while passing the cheap rice wine back and forth.\nJust then, the guard who'd brought the wine tilted his head with a puzzled expression, then narrowed his eyes and pressed his face to the window.\nPeering through the tiny opening cut into one side of the gate, he muttered, \"Someone's coming.\"\nThrough the darkness, a figure dressed in black robes was approaching.\n\"Isn't that the girl's father?\"\nHis companion asked, recalling similar incidents from before, but the guard staring intently through the window shook his head.\nAs the distance closed, the face of the approaching figure became visible in the moonlight.\n'A mask?'\nThe person was wearing a mask that looked vaguely familiar from his childhood visits to temples. It had an angry expression etched into it.\nThud. Thud.\nWith steady footsteps, the masked intruder approached the gate. The guard watching through the window called out, “Who the hell are you!”\n\"I am the incarnation that Maitreya has sent ahead to this world to cleanse you bastards.\"\nAt the masked man's response, both guards burst into mocking laughter.\n\"This guy's completely insane.\"\n“Looks like he came here looking to die.”\nThe two guards exchanged glances and jokes, but soon felt something was wrong.\n'Hey, why are you falling sideways?'\n'What about you?'\nThe colleague in front of him was tilting over.\nNo, the entire world was tilting.\nSlice!\nA delayed cutting sound echoed through the air, and their upper bodies began falling as it separated from their lower halves.\nCreeeeak.\nCRASH!\nAnd so did the gate as it crashed in two.\nInside one of the Red Serpent Gang's halls.\n\"Fuck.\"\nA young man spat out curses as he glared toward where the boss's quarters were located.\n“I’m the one who did all the goddamn work.”\nHe was the one who had brought a woman to the Red Serpent Gang today.\nShe was someone he'd known before. A woman he'd approached with romantic interest, only to be coldly rejected.\n\"I prefer men who live honestly, like my father.\"\nIt had been a humiliating answer. It felt like she looked down on him for being involved with the Unorthodox Path.\nHow dare a mere commoner disrespect him, a martial artist? He wanted revenge.\nSo he'd tricked her father into borrowing money and kept quiet for six months, waiting for the debt to multiply tenfold.\nIn just a few months, the debt had indeed grown ten times larger to an impossible amount for that \"honest\" man to repay. Eventually, she was forcibly sold off.\nHe thought his revenge had succeeded. He'd get to have his fun with that bitch who'd looked down on him before she was sold off as a prostitute.\nBut as soon as it was revealed that she was inexperienced with men, that damn boss's eyes lit up with greed.\nWhether it was because of his half-baked revenge or his anger toward the boss, the young man couldn't fall asleep at all.\nCreeeeak.\nCRASH!\nJust then, a dull and heavy boom echoed in the man's ears.\n\"Who goes there!!\"\nThe Red Serpent Gang's thugs, awakened by the commotion, began rushing out one by one with weapons in hand.\n\"Fuck.\"\nThe young man also stepped out, his face brimming with killing intent as he drew his saber.\nHe wanted to vent his frustration on the boss.\nOnce outside, his eyes fell upon the sight of a man surrounded by his Red Serpent Gang comrades.\nThe stranger wore a bizarre get-up of black robes and a wrathful deity mask.\nBut his curiosity about the strange outfit was brief. More than anything, he felt disappointed.\n\"Heheh. I've been bored these past few days without tasting blood.\"\n\"I'll turn you into a damn pincushion.\"\nBefore he could even get involved, his colleagues surrounding that man would tear him to shreds.\n'Am I too late again?'\nJust as the young man clicked his tongue in disappointment at missing another chance to vent his anger—\n\"Tsk.\"\nSuddenly, light flashed across the cloudless night sky like lightning.\nThe young man wondered if he was seeing things.\nBut he wasn't mistaken.\nLike lightning followed by thunder, a delayed sound came after the flash of light.\nSlice!\nImmediately after, the bodies of his colleagues surrounding the intruder collapsed like puppets with cut strings.\n\"...\"\nStill wondering if he was hallucinating, the young man unconsciously rubbed his eyes.\nWhen he opened them again, the courtyard floor was soaked with blood, and the heads of those who'd fallen like puppets were all separated from their bodies.\n\"Holy shit...\"\nFinally grasping reality, the young man's entire body broke out in goosebumps.\n'I need to run...'\nHis face paled with terror.\nThe young man quickly tried to turn and flee, but his feet wouldn't move.\nIt wasn't because his body had frozen with fear. It was simply because...\nSlice!\nHis head was already falling toward the ground.\nThe Red Serpent Gang boss's quarters.\n\"Heheheh.\"\nA middle-aged man gazed with a sinister smile at a woman dressed in clothes that revealed glimpses of her skin.\nDespite the heavy makeup and outfit making her appear older, she looked too young to be called a woman.\n\"To come forward to pay your father's debt, what a filial daughter you are.\"\nThe Red Serpent Gang boss spoke to the trembling girl.\n\"No need to fear. I'm not going to do anything that would damage your market value. Heheh. Think of tonight as a lesson from a seasoned veteran. Pay attention, and you’ll learn what you need to know to pay off your father's debt.\"\nUpon hearing that the woman had no experience with men, the Red Serpent Gang’s boss was more than willing to personally \"educate\" her.\nIt was the boss's way of showing consideration for a woman about to be sold as a prostitute.\nHe'd done this often enough before to know exactly what to prepare, even having outfits like the one she wore right now.\n“First, come here and try pouring me a drink.”\nWhen the young woman only trembled harder, his expression turned menacing.\n\"Do you want to see your father die?\"\nStartled by the boss's threat, the woman approached him with tears welling in her eyes.\nJust as she was about to pick up the wine bottle—\nCRASH!\nA dull noise echoed from beyond the quarters.\n\"Who goes there!!\"\nThe Red Serpent Gang's thugs began shouting one after another.\nThe boss frowned as the woman flinched at the commotion and began to tremble.\n\"Now, now. Hurry up and pour the wine.\"\nConfident that his subordinates would handle whatever was happening outside, the boss reached out his hand toward the woman.\nWhen the boss's hand touched the woman's hand holding the wine bottle, she shuddered as if a snake were crawling up her arm.\nEven as the sounds of commotion, screams, and clashing metal continued from beyond the quarters, she endured.\n'Please...'\nShe fought back the tears, forcing herself to be strong for her father’s sake.\nThe boss's blatant stare at her exposed skin made her feel as if snakes were slithering all over her body.\nJust as she poured wine into the boss's cup, overwhelmed by shame—\nSlice!\nWith a clean cutting sound, as if the neck of a snake were being lopped off, the door to the chamber was sheared away.\n“Well, you’re certainly having the time of your life.”\nIl-mok scoffs at the sight of the boss enjoying himself with the woman in his quarters and completely oblivious to his subordinates dying outside.\n“Who the hell are you!!”\nThe boss finally bellowed, fumbling for the massive blade at his side.\n\"Is that the Red Serpent Gang’s official greeting? Why does every bastard who pops up say the exact same thing? I can't figure it out.\"\nDespite Il-mok's provocative words, the Red Serpent Gang boss didn't dare attack recklessly.\n‘He defeated all of them in that short span of time?’\nSeveral seconds had passed since the strange, masked intruder arrived at his hall, yet there was still no sign of any subordinates chasing him from behind.\nOnly the bodies of a few subordinates could be seen lying on the ground in the darkness.\nWhile the masked intruder and the Red Serpent Gang boss faced each other—\n\"Please help me!!\"\nThe girl hurriedly threw herself toward Il-mok as she cried out.\n\"You bitch, how dare you!!\"\nThe enraged Red Serpent Gang boss quickly swung his saber at the girl, but—\nClang!\nThe Sword Qi that Il-mok had fired instantly sent the Red Serpent Master’s saber flying.\nWith the girl safe, Il-mok looked at her as she rushed toward him.\nFacing Il-mok in his wrathful deity mask, the girl cried out with a tear-streaked face:\n“P-Please, s-save my father and me. P-please.”\nIt was an explanation that omitted all context, but Il-mok could grasp the general situation.\n\"Step back, close your eyes, and cover your ears.\"\nAfter telling the girl this, Il-mok approached the Red Serpent Gang boss.\nWatching the angry-masked intruder approach him, the Red Serpent Gang boss swallowed hard.\nHe already knew the truth.\nThe man approaching him was a master on a completely different level.\nIt wasn't just because he'd killed all his subordinates in such a short time.\nWhen his sword had been blocked by this man's Sword Qi earlier, the Red Serpent Gang boss hadn't even been able to properly see the motion of the intruder drawing his sword.\nSo the Red Serpent Gang boss shouted, \"S-stop! Don't you know that the Heavenly Orchid Society backs our Red Serpent Gang?\"\n\"Heavenly Orchid Society?\"\nWhen Il-mok halted his steps and repeated the name, the Red Serpent Master hurriedly shouted.\n\"Y-yes! Our Red Serpent Gang pays tribute to the Heavenly Orchid Society!\"\nSeeing the angry-masked intruder stop, the Red Serpent Gang boss's tongue worked frantically.\n\"You must not know, great hero, but nothing will change even if you kill this boss! We don't do this because we enjoy it! To meet the tribute demands from the Heavenly Orchid Society, we have no choice but to...\"\nThe Red Serpent Gang boss's excuse trailed off. Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs novｅlfire.net\nHe'd finally seen the cynical smile plastered on the lips visible through the intruder’s wrathful deity mask.\nTo Il-mok's ears, the Red Serpent Gang boss's excuse was absolutely ridiculous.\nIt wasn't just because of the absurd pretext spat out by a man who had been luring a young woman into his room to make her serve him in strange ways.\n\"The Heavenly Orchid Society is your backing, huh? Then who do you think backs me?\"\nThe sight of this fool invoking the Heavenly Orchid Society as his backing in the presence of the mighty Heavenly Demon Divine Cult was simply too amusing.",

    "content": "Chapter 187: Maitreya Luminous Cult (3)\nThe Red Serpent Gang's boss's eyes widened like saucers at the intruder's cocky response.\n\"B-backing? What kind of backing are you—\"\nHe couldn't even finish his sentence.\nClang!\nThe wrathful-masked man had already lunged forward with his sword, and the Red Serpent Gang boss was scrambling just to block the first strike.\nHe barely managed to swing his saber and deflect the initial attack, but his stance crumbled completely.\nThrough his wavering vision, he saw the intruder's sword coming at him slowly.\nBut somehow, even though the enemy's sword looked sluggish, he couldn't block it.\nIt wasn't that Il-mok's sword had slowed down. Time itself seemed to crawl when death was staring you in the face.\n\"Gkk...\"\nHis heart pierced clean through, the Red Serpent Gang’s boss collapsed to the ground with a choked gasp.\nShortly after Il-mok stormed into the Red Serpent Gang estate, people began gathering around the estate.\nSome of them had been at that meeting on the mountainside near Gulang County earlier.\n\"Are you out of your damn mind? Do you have any idea what place that is?”\n\"Well, since he made such a big claim, we should at least see it with our own eyes.\"\n\"You seriously believe what that guy said?\"\nThey weren't exactly rushing in with complete confidence.\nA few driven by curiosity or faint hope had taken the lead in following Il-mok, while others—trying to stop them or seeking comfort in numbers—tagged along with nervous uncertainty.\nThey crept closer to the Red Serpent Gang estate under the moonlight, while carefully keeping their distance out of fear. That's when they noticed something bizarre.\n“Th-that over there. Isn’t that the gate to the manor?”\n\"The gate's been split in half?\"\nOnly then did they realize the Red Serpent Gang's gate had been cleaved apart and lay scattered on the ground with two corpses sprawled in front of the broken gate.\nRight at that moment—\n\"AAAAHHHHH!\"\n\"P-please, spare me...\"\nScreams and desperate pleas for mercy echoed from inside the compound.\n\"Eek!\"\nWatching nervously from a distance, the people of Gulang County turned pale and staggered backward.\nBut the commotion died down as quickly as it had started.\n\"......\"\nThe ashen-faced residents looked at each other.\n“D-don’t tell me… he killed all of them?”\n\"Should we go inside and check?\"\n\"Hey, you idiot! What if that masked guy got taken down instead?\"\nThe funny thing was that not a single one of them was worried about the Red Serpent Gang thugs.\nThat's how deep the townspeople's hatred for the Red Serpent Gang ran.\nAs they stood there, unsure what to do and glancing nervously at each other—\nStep. Step.\nFaint footsteps reached their ears.\nThe residents stared at the Red Serpent Gang's entrance with tense faces.\nSoon, two figures emerged through the wide-open gate.\nOne was a man wearing a wrathful mask, and the other was a girl too young to be really called a young woman.\nThe girl Il-mok had rescued felt uneasy seeing people gathered at the Red Serpent Gang entrance.\nMost were faces she recognized. After all, she was also a resident of Gulang County.\nMaybe it was seeing familiar faces that finally loosened her tongue. The girl who had been frozen stiff finally spoke up.\n“G-Great Hero. M-may I a-ask you just one thing?”\n\"Go ahead.\"\nHearing the masked man's response, the girl asked hesitantly.\n\"W-who are you?\"\nWhat she saw next was absolutely bizarre.\nBehind that angry mask, the man's lips were curved upward in a pleasant smile.\n\"I am the incarnation of Maitreya.\"\n\"The incarnation of... Maitreya?\"\nAs the girl blinked in confusion at this unimaginable answer, the masked man had already vanished without a trace.\nInstead, others rushed forward to fill the empty space.\n\"Cheong-ah! Are you okay?\"\n\"What happened in there?\"\nThe residents who'd come to the Red Serpent Gang bombarded the girl with questions.\nThe girl who'd been dragged to the Red Serpent Gang for unfortunate reasons had just become an unwitting witness to a religious event.\nUsing stealth techniques to hide himself, Il-mok made his way to the Gulang County branch of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\n\"Whew.\"\nSighing lightly, Il-mok stripped off his sweat and blood-stained clothes and submerged himself in a pre-prepared bath.\nAs he washed himself in the still-warm water, he muttered to himself with relief.\n\"That was close.\" ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ n͟o͟v͟e͟l͟f͟i͟r͟e͟.net\nHe wasn't talking about the fight at the Red Serpent Gang.\nTrying to move in stealth while covered in blood and sweat had nearly triggered his hygiene obsession. Just because he was starting to break free from the Extremity didn't mean the side effects had disappeared completely.\nAfter thoroughly cleaning himself and putting on fresh clothes, Il-mok sensed people entering the branch.\n\"Did you bring everything?\" Il-mok asked the group of people dressed in black.\nThey were his lunatic group.\nThey had used stealth techniques to sneak into the Red Serpent Gang compound while Il-mok raised hell inside.\nIn response to Il-mok's question, they each held out what they'd gathered.\nGold and silver coins, jewelry, ledgers, and other valuables filled their hands.\nTheir mission had been to steal the account books the Red Serpent Gang bastards had kept and whatever money they'd greedily hoarded.\nJu Seo-yeon and Baek Cheon were left to monitor the crowd's mood.\nThe Red Serpent Gang wasn't that big, so five people were plenty. Plus, those two weren't exactly suited for this kind of work.\n‘At least I hope they don't cause any trouble.’\nAn airhead and an attention-whore weren't exactly great for covert operations.\nThe odd one out was Hyeokryeon Seon-ah.\nIl-mok's original plan was to leave her at the gathering since he had assumed he wasn’t familiar with stealth techniques due to her limited training and education.\nBut who would have known that Hyeokryeon Seon-ah could use stealth skills and insisted on coming along.\n‘Must've learned it from her family.’\nIl-mok figured it was nothing special, considering that Jeong Hyeon had also been well-versed in concealment arts before his admission to the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nIl-mok addressed those holding out books and treasure.\n“Hand these over to the Gulang County Branch Leader. Instruct him to send one-tenth to the main headquarters, leave one-tenth here as operational funds, and for the rest, check the ledgers and return appropriate portions to people who were robbed.\"\n“As you command!”\n\"Oh, and tell the Branch Leader to look into something called the Heavenly Orchid Society.\"\n\"The Heavenly Orchid Society?\"\n\"That's right. The Red Serpent Gang boss mentioned them before he died. Said the Heavenly Orchid Society was their backing.\"\n\"We'll have the Branch Leader investigate, and we'll gather information separately as well.\"\nResponding to Il-mok's orders, Dam Bin directed the group to organize the money and documents in one place.\nAfter the Red Serpent Gang fell overnight...\n\"Did you hear that story?\"\n\"About the Maitreya Luminous Cult?\"\nWord of the Maitreya Luminous Cult began spreading through Gulang County.\n\"Come on, you don't actually believe that nonsense, do you?\"\n\"Hey, you stubborn fool. I saw it with my own eyes that night. That Incarnation of Maitreya swept away those Red Serpent Gang scumbags.\"\nPeople talk about the Divine Cult’s doctrines even without being goaded by the cult’s warrior. And of course, the cult’s warrior didn’t waste this opportunity.\n\"Maitreya is definitely protecting our Gulang County!\"\n“Believe! Blessings will come to those who believe!”\nThe most enthusiastic among them was Baek Cheon. That being said, he wasn't causing a commotion by gathering people like he usually did.\nInstead, whenever one of the martial artists from the Gulang County branch subtly spread a rumor about the Maitreya Luminous Cult to the villagers—\n\"Is that really true?!\"\n\"Wow. If that story's real, then calling him the Incarnation of Maitreya isn't strange at all!\"\n—Baek Cheon would act like he was hearing it for the first time, using exaggerated acting to sway people.\nHe'd fallen for Il-mok's smooth talk.\n\"Performing on stage isn't the only kind of acting. Only when you can weave acting into daily life can you truly be called a master of the craft.\"\nDeeply moved by Il-mok's advice, Baek Cheon threw himself into missionary work with this new approach.\nAnd the mastermind behind this cult fever sweeping Gulang County was leisurely focusing on his training at the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult branch.\nAfter Il-mok finished his internal energy cultivation and lowered his sword, Jin Hayeon who had been waiting alone to guard him threw a question.\n\"Young Master, I have something I'd like to ask.\"\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\"Was there a particular reason you personally took action against the Red Serpent Gang?\"\nWhile it might have seemed like concern for her charge taking on dangerous work on the surface, Jin Hayeon's question carried a deeper meaning.\n'I do not doubt that the Young Master is a genius, but he's not usually one to take initiative.’\nAs someone who had been with Il-mok since his early days in the cult, she knew very well that Il-mok was quite lazy, contrary to his reputation.\n\"There are several reasons, but first... aren't they pitiful?\"\n\"???\"\nJin Hayeon looked confused by Il-mok's words.\n\"The people of Gulang County. Based on what I heard from the Branch Leader, they've been suffering a lot under the Red Serpent Gang.\"\nEven with Il-mok's explanation, Jin Hayeon still looked puzzled.\nIt wasn't because she'd lost empathy from practicing the White Hand Demonic Art. Separate from empathy, she'd been indoctrinated through doctrine to save people.\nIt was just that...\n“I was not aware that you were someone who'd go out of his way to handle troublesome matters just because others were suffering, Young Master.\"\nIt seemed strange for Il-mok to talk about compassion.\nOf course, Il-mok also found it just as absurd that she questioned him about this.\n'Just because she's a psychopath, does she see me as one too?'\nSensing some misunderstanding about himself, Il-mok shrugged and answered nonchalantly.\n“And why would I not have sympathy?”\n“It is just that you have always seemed rather indifferent to others.”\n\"I act indifferent precisely because I have compassion.\"\n\"???\"\n“If you go around getting involved and helping everyone here and there, it'd be too bothersome and exhausting. When I hear sad stories, I want to help, so I just choose not to listen in the first place.\"\n\"......\"\nJin Hayeon could only make a bewildered expression at Il-mok's twisted logic.\nBut regardless of her feelings, Il-mok was speaking sincerely.\nAs he had once told the Heavenly Demon at Peach Blossom Ridge, Il-mok believed that even hypocrisy was a form of goodness. His choice to become a social welfare civil servant had similar reasoning.\nIl-mok wanted to perform good deeds and help people in need in moderation. He wanted to arrive at work on time and leave work on time. He only wanted to help those who needed social services during his designated work hours.\nHe had no intention of doing good deeds to the point of exhaustion or burning himself out. He just wanted to perform small-scale, ordinary citizen-level good deeds, not saint-like acts.\nIl-mok's reasons for getting involved this time followed the same logic.\nIn addition to pitying the people of Gulang County...\n\"Another reason was to hide my identity.\"\nTo avoid getting constantly dragged into work.\n“Is that why you used the mask?”\n\"Exactly. In religious faith, mystique is important.\"\nThough he packaged it nicely...\n“For the sake of that mystique, I plan to wear the mask and step forward only when there are major issues in the future.”\nHe intended to use \"mystique\" as an excuse to dump all the trivial matters on others.",

    "content": "Chapter 188: Maitreya Luminous Cult (4) ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ nοvelfire.net\nA few days later, late evening.\nPeople started gathering on the mountainside near Gulang County.\nThey were coming together for the second assembly of the Maitreya Luminous Cult.\nThanks to the incident where the Red Serpent Gang fell, the number of attendees had easily tripled compared to the first gathering.\n\"Maitreya is the light and hope who will burn away all the world's evil and save us poor souls.\"\n\"Believe in him.\"\nAs the martial artists from Gulang County's branch led the sermon, the gathered common folk responded like they were chanting some kind of mantra.\n“The Advent of Maitreya!\"\n“Salvation for All People!\"\nAmong them, the most desperate in her prayers was that girl who'd been dragged to the Red Serpent Gang on that fateful night.\nThe girl named Cheong-ah had been with all her might even before joining the assembly.\nShe'd actually converted more new believers than the cult members from Gulang County's branch did.\n\"Repent! All of you, repent and believe in Maitreya! If you do, peace will come to you.\"\n“The Advent of Maitreya!\"\n“Salvation for All People!\"\nOnce again, someone's sermon continued, and those listening began reciting the prayer without anyone taking the lead.\nIl-mok, who had been leisurely watching the gathering while hiding in a tree near the assembly area, felt a shiver run down his spine.\n'Good thing I kept my identity hidden. Ugh.'\nThe whole thing just looked like it came straight out of a horror genre cult-themed movie.\nThe assembly went on for quite a while. Then, a middle-aged guy who'd been anxiously looking around with a restless expression suddenly spoke up.\n\"But isn't Maitreya's incarnation supposed to show up today?\"\nThe Gulang County Branch Leader answered as if anticipating that question.\n\"Maitreya's incarnation is the one who cleanses evil in Maitreya's place. He only descends to the mortal world when there's evil like the Red Serpent Gang.\"\n\"But there is evil!\"\nAt the man's cry, everyone's attention focused on the middle-aged guy.\nWith eyes that seemed touched by madness, he yelled out.\n\"That Old Man Park who runs the pharmacy in the marketplace! You all know what a horrible bastard he is, right? He makes sick people who can't even work pay for their medicine every single time! He's a vicious bastard who makes money off poor people's lives!\"\nIl-mok clicked his tongue internally as he watched from the tree.\n'I knew this would happen.'\nIt was pretty much what he'd expected.\nHumanity was not inherently virtuous. This was not a thought that came from being completely indoctrinated by the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. He knew it all too well from dealing with these kinds of people so many times during his days as a civil servant.\nEspecially the malice and rage toward the world that festered deep in poor people's hearts. That shit was beyond imagination.\nIt went without saying that most of the troublemakers who gave civil servants hell were exactly those types of people.\n“There’s someone even worse than Old Man Park!”\n\"What about Mrs. Chae from the upper district! She hounds her maids and servants so relentlessly that anyone who works there once comes out a sobbing mess!”\nA different kind of madness swept through the Maitreya Luminous Cult's assembly.\nThe madness named ‘hatred,’ where people accused one another, praying that those they disliked would receive divine punishment.\nAfter watching this for a moment, Il-mok used his lightness skill to jump down from the tree.\nThud.\nBy the time Il-mok's feet hit the ground, an angry mask had already appeared on his face.\n\"It's the incarnation!\"\n\"Maitreya's incarnation has come!\"\nThe believers who'd seen Il-mok at the first assembly shouted out, and people immediately started screaming all at once.\nScreams filled with madness, begging him to kill everyone they had grudges against.\nBut their screaming didn't last long.\n\"SILENCE!\"\nThe internal energy imbued within that shout swept away their madness.\n“Hk…”\nThe waves of internal energy and killing intent radiating from Il-mok's body were way too heavy and terrifying for ordinary people to handle.\nAs silence fell over the area, Il-mok spoke in a low voice.\n\"Today, I have manifested here again because I sensed a flow of deep malice and resentment.”\nHaving said that, Il-mok suddenly pointed his sword at the middle-aged man who'd shouted first.\n\"Do you wish for this man called Old Man Park to die?\"\n\"Y-yes.\"\nThe man answered while trembling, but with madness still in his eyes. A gray-colored energy began swirling around Il-mok's sword.\n“What if you pay for your life in exchange for that?”\n\"?!\"\nWhile the man's face went white at the unexpected question, Il-mok spoke again.\n\"Have you truly committed no sins? Never told a lie in your life, never fought with anyone?\"\n\"That's... that is...\"\n\"Are you really confident that no one is praying to Maitreya for your death?\"\nThe man whose face had gone pale couldn't bring himself to speak and hung his head to avoid Il-mok's gaze.\nOnly then did Il-mok slowly turn his head and look at the faces of several people who'd joined the assembly.\n“You all are laboring under a great misunderstanding.”\nHis gaze fell upon those who had been so earnestly spitting out hatred just a moment ago.\n\"Maitreya will descend to punish the world's evil. So let me ask you this. Can you guarantee that you'll be able to escape Maitreya's divine punishment?\"\nWas it because of Il-mok's words? Or was it because of the murderous aura continuously emanating from his body?\nNot a single person dared to confidently answer \"yes\" to Il-mok's question.\nWhile everyone trembled with their heads bowed low, Il-mok's words continued.\n\"On the day Maitreya descends to this world, all the world's evildoers will receive divine punishment. So what should you be doing? Shouldn't you first think about avoiding evil and living to help others in order to escape Maitreya's wrath?\"\nLive a good life.\nAfter spouting this clichéd message, Il-mok suddenly swung his sword toward empty air.\nThe Sword Qi that swept past the people frozen in terror traveled far and split a thick tree in the distance with a thunderous roar.\n\"Evil scums like those from the Red Serpent Gang will all be cast into hell's pit by Maitreya. When that day comes, a great light shall find those who have lived virtuous lives.”\nAfter speaking so intimidatingly, Il-mok ended with those quiet words. The girl called Cheong-ah shouted out.\n\"I will repent! Every night I'll repent my sins, believing that Maitreya will punish the wicked, and I'll wait for that day!\"\nRight after she shouted that, the Gulang County Branch Leader also yelled.\n“The Advent of Maitreya!!\"\nFollowing his lead, everyone gathered there and shouted in unison.\n“Salvation for All People!!\"\nWhy was it?\nDespite realizing that Maitreya was not a kind god who would grant every wish they prayed for…\n“The Advent of Maitreya!!\"\n“Salvation for All People!!\"\nThe faith in the eyes of those gathered at the assembly had grown even deeper.\nIt was because of the reverence that came from fear.\nHumans naturally don't feel admiration for beings they can control at will.\n\"Let us repent!\"\n“The Advent of Maitreya!”\n“Salvation for All People!!”\nDam Bin also realized something thanks to the reverence in the eyes of the people fervently offering prayers.\nShe now understood why Il-mok had suddenly stepped forward to admonish the masses.\n'Don't tell me the Young Master had anticipated everything up to this point?'\nAmazed by Il-mok's scheme, she thought.\n'Now I think I understand why the Supreme One cherishes the Eighth Young Master so dearly.'\nThe Gulang County Branch Leader was thinking the same thing.\nOf course, Il-mok was just thinking. 'Phew. Now no one should come looking for me for a while.'\nHe had only threatened them because he couldn't be bothered to handle their unreasonable complaints.\nThe next afternoon.\nIl-mok was swinging his sword alone at the deserted branch headquarters.\n'Tsk. Guess that Red Serpent Gang’s boss is too weak.'\nUnfortunately, he wasn't getting any particular insights.\nThe enlightenment that used to come rushing whenever he experienced real combat hadn't shown its face recently.\nIt’s clear that the higher one’s level, the more remote the prospect of gaining enlightenment becomes.\nCreak.\nWhen he heard the unpleasant friction sound and people returning to the branch, Il-mok lowered his sword.\n“Good work.”\nAt Il-mok's praise, Dam Bin answered on behalf of everyone.\n“We didn’t do anything. It's all thanks to you setting up the situation, Young Master.\"\nThe others nodded in agreement.\nFor Il-mok, it was a situation he couldn't quite relate to.\n'They're happy even though I gave them more work to do.'\nThree years since being dragged into the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, and Il-mok still could not understand the thought process of these cultists.\n“Furthermore, the investigation into the matter you instructed us on is roughly finished.”\nAs she said this, Dam Bin looked at the Gulang County Branch Leader, who stepped forward and spoke.\n\"The Heavenly Orchid Society that the Red Serpent Gang’s boss mentioned is a group of lawless heretical martial artists who claim to be the masters of Lanzhou, Young Master.\"\nLanzhou was the capital of Gansu Province.\nHearing the news that a bunch of heretic bastards had taken control of the capital, Il-mok frowned.\n\"Now, that surprises me. I can't believe the Murim Alliance is just leaving those guys alone.\"\nDam Bin just smiled coldly.\n\"Why would those hypocrites who call themselves the Orthodox Faction be interested in Gansu Province, which doesn't make any money?\"\nHer answer made Il-mok recall what he had learned about Gansu when he was learning in the main headquarters.\n'I'm pretty sure I heard that Gansu Province used to be quite wealthy in the past.'\nHundreds of years ago, to be precise.\nThe Silk Road that was used when the Central Plains traded with the Western world was directly connected to Gansu province.\nCountless merchants passed through Gansu Province to use the Silk Road on their way to Xinjiang, and naturally, there was a time when gold and treasures flowed into Gansu Province.\nHowever, after going through periods of war, the number of people using the Silk Road rapidly decreased, and then an incident occurred that made it impossible to use Gansu Province as a trade route.\nThat incident was the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult establishing itself in Xinjiang about two hundred years ago.\nWith Gansu no longer viable as part of the Silk Road, the number of merchants visiting dwindled and Gansu Province gradually lost its vitality.\nHe even recalled hearing that because it was right next to Xinjiang, large sects and merchant caravans wouldn’t even come near the place, fearing that the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult could invade at any moment.\n'It was because of these crazy cultist bastards.'\nAs Il-mok looked over his companions with disgust, Dam Bin misunderstood the meaning behind that look and added.\n\"The only factions that might be interested are the three from Sichuan Province and two sects from Shaanxi Province, but they're too busy watching each other to move easily.\"\nThe three from Sichuan were Qingcheng, Emei, and the Sichuan Tang Family, while the two sects from Shaanxi were Mount Hua and Zhongnan.\nThough they were grouped together as orthodox sects, they weren't completely on the same side.\nThey could be described as having the kind of relationship where if one left home to occupy Gansu, the others would gladly ransack their rival’s empty house while wearing a smile.\nThinking about the Nine Sects & One Gang and the Seven Great Families, Il-mok remembered something from a martial arts novel he'd read in his previous life.\n\"Huh? But wasn't there a famous orthodox sect in Gansu Province? What happened to the Kongtong Sect?\"\nThough the name varied from novel to novel, and in most cases it only appeared at the level of being mentioned by name, Kongtong Sect was definitely a name often mentioned among the Nine Sects & One Gang.\nAnd Kongtong Mountain, the base of the Kongtong Sect, was located at the edge of Gansu Province.\nBut for some reason, Dam-bin looked at Il-mok with a somewhat ambiguous expression.\n\"The Kongtong Sect is now just a sect that exists in name only, Young Master.\"\n\"That Kongtong Sect?\"\nWhen Il-mok asked back with a face that said he didn't understand anything, Dam Bin briefly organized her thoughts and then answered succinctly.\n“Do you know of the greatest battle recorded in the history of the Third Heavenly Demon, the Hegemonic Heavenly Demon?\"\nAs someone who had graduated first from the Hall of the Demonic Way, Il-mok understood the situation just from that seemingly random question.\nThe Hegemonic Heavenly Demon died over six hundred years ago. He was a figure from when the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult was still active in the Central Plains, and he led the cult's revival.\nHe was so renowned for his unconventional path of sweeping away anyone who displeased him that he was posthumously given the name Hegemonic Heavenly Demon.\nAs was customary for the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, the majority of the Hegemonic Heavenly Demon’s accomplishments vanished like a mirage due to the war of succession that followed his ascension.\nAnyway, according to the history he'd learned from the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, the Hegemonic Heavenly Demon had once gone alone to sweep away some Daoist bastards who were spreading false teachings.\nThat battle where he slaughtered hundreds of Daoist priests by himself was recorded as the greatest battle among the Hegemonic Heavenly Demon's achievements.\nSo that meant.\n'So hypocritical Daoist bastards that the Hegemonic Heavenly Demon swept away were the Kongtong Sect!!'\nIl-mok realized just how biased and distorted the history he had been taught truly was.",

    "content": "Chapter 189: Heavenly Orchid Society (1)\nWhile Il-mok was reeling from the shocking truth he'd just learned, Dam Bin continued.\n\"During the era when the Hegemonic Heavenly Demon was active, there was no such thing as the Nine Great Sects and One Gang. It was only after the Kongtong Sect was wiped out that some of its survivors scattered across the land and started their own Daoist sects. Over the long years, a few of these grew into massive organizations, eventually becoming what we now know as the Nine Great Sects and One Gang.\"\nSo the Kongtong Sect was basically the ancestor of several major Daoist sects.\nIt was only then that it finally clicked for Il-mok.\n'It's honestly a miracle they made it to Xinjiang alive.'\nIf some of the sects within the Nine Great Sects and One Gang were founded by Kongtong Sect survivors, their hatred for the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult would be beyond imagination.\nThe fact that the Cult wasn’t completely wiped off the map and actually escaped to Xinjiang was nothing short of miraculous.\n“So, which of the Nine Sects were the ones founded by the Kongtong descendants?”\n\"Mount Hua, Qingcheng, Diancang, and Kunlun. Though Kunlun no longer exists—Hainan took its place.\"\n\"...What the hell happened to Kunlun?\"\nSomething about this felt ominous, so Il-mok had to ask.\n\"Do you happen to remember the history of the Ninth Heavenly Demon, the Blood Tear Heavenly Demon?\"\nAt Dam Bin's response, Il-mok squeezed his eyes shut.\nThe Blood Tear Heavenly Demon was one of the names he'd memorized by heart during his entrance exam prep for the Hall of the Demonic Way, especially since his title was similar to the Blood Rain Heavenly Demon.\nThe Blood Tear Heavenly Demon lived about 160 years ago and was the Heavenly Demon who ruled after the cult was driven to Xinjiang—actually, he was the great-great-predecessor to the current one.\nMore importantly, he was the first Heavenly Demon to attempt to return to the Central Plains after being exiled to Xinjiang.\nHe got the name ‘Blood Tear Heavenly Demon’ from the story that he literally cried tears of blood when his invasion finally failed.\nThe next Heavenly Demon—the great-predecessor—also tried invading the Central Plains, and after that attempt also fell through, the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult entered a long, dark period lasting decades.\nFor ages, no one managed to truly master the Heavenly Demon Divine Arts since the cult leadership changed hands multiple times every few years or even decades. It wasn't until the current Heavenly Demon, Hyeokryeon Il-hwi, took the position that this dark age finally came to an end.\nLearning from his predecessors' failures, the current Heavenly Demon focused on strengthening the cult's foundation rather than rashly attempting to reclaim the Central Plains.\nWhile Il-mok was mentally replaying everything he’d ever learned about this, Dam Bin continued speaking.\n\"After the Blood Tear Heavenly Demon destroyed Kunlun Sect and pressed his advance, those cowards from Sichuan Province all ran away. And those despicable bastards gathered others under the name Murim Alliance and trapped the Blood Tear Heavenly Demon in an ambush.\"\nAnd so, Il-mok had stumbled upon the founding of the Murim Alliance.\nSeeing Il-mok with his eyes tightly shut, Dam Bin offered some consolation.\n\"But don't worry, Young Master. The Blood Tear Heavenly Demon remembered what happened with the Hegemonic Heavenly Demon and the Kongtong Sect. So, unlike with Kongtong, he made sure to wipe out every last trace of the Kunlun Sect.\"\nWhat a truly comforting story that was.\nAs the fresh realization of what a batshit crazy group he’d joined washed over him, Il-mok pressed a thumb to his aching temple.\n“Okay, I get why a bunch of scums can run wild in a major province. Tell me more specifically about this Heavenly Orchid Society or whatever it's called.\"\nThe Branch Leader answered Il-mok's question.\n\"To put it simply, they're trash that sucks the lifeblood out of the common people.\"\nThe Branch Leader opened some documents and pointed to several passages with his finger.\n\"As you can see, we found evidence that the Red Serpent Gang was using loan sharking to snatch up women, then shipping them off to the Heavenly Orchid Society instead of paying their usual tribute. When we investigated other nearby counties, we found similar patterns.\"\n\"So you're saying that, just like the Red Serpent Gang, other underworld organizations in nearby counties have been sending money and women as tribute in the same way?\"\n“Yes. Some of the women end up in brothels run by the Heavenly Orchid Society, while others seem to have been sold off somewhere else.\"\nIl-mok's face twisted at the Branch Leader's explanation, and a wave of pure murderous aura washed over everyone else in the room.\n'These crazy bastards are something else. '\nA force that orchestrated human trafficking.\nThe Red Serpent Gang leader’s excuses might have been nothing more than that, just excuses, but this much was certain.\nAs long as the Heavenly Orchid Society existed, human trafficking would never disappear from Gansu Province.\nJust then, urgent footsteps could be heard outside the door.\n\"Come in.\"\nThe second Il-mok gave the permission, one of the Gulang County branch's martial artists burst in and shouted.\n\"The Heavenly Orchid Society bastards are here!”\n\"The Heavenly Orchid Society?\"\n\"Yes, Young Master. They're the ones who regularly visit Gulang County to deal with the Red Serpent Gang. Our people say they’re heading toward the estate right now.”\nBy the time the martial artist finished his explanation, Il-mok already had a mask on his face.\nA mask of a wrathful Buddha.\nIt had only been a few days, but the Red Serpent Gang's estate already felt like an abandoned husk.\n\"The Red Serpent Gang collapsed?\"\nThree men dressed in blue martial robes were pressing blades to a local resident's throat as they questioned him.\n“Who did it?”\nThe man was so terrified his face had gone white, and he was too frozen to speak.\n“Looks like we’ll have to make an example of him.”\nJust as the Heavenly Orchid Society martial artist muttered this and swung his sword to cut off the man's arm, the woman beside him frantically shouted:\n\"It, it was the Incarnation of Maitreya!\"\n\"Incarnation of Maitreya?\"\nThe name was so unfamiliar to them that their face contorted when they heard that.\n\"Who the hell is that?\"\nThe man kept his sword on her husband as he asked, and the woman froze, not knowing what to say.\nShe too had only heard about it through rumors spreading around Gulang County. She had no idea who this Incarnation of Maitreya actually was.\nIn a terrifying situation where her husband was a second away from having his head lopped off, the wife’s eyes darted around, desperately searching for something.\nShe was desperately hoping for help and looking for anyone who might know who this ‘Incarnation of Maitreya’ was.\nAnd at some point, her gaze became fixed on something.\n\"Th-that person!\"\nThere stood a man in black robes wearing the wrathful deity mask she'd only heard about in rumors.\nThe trio withdrew their swords from the villager and turned their attention to the man.\n\"So you're the bastard who destroyed the Red Serpent Gang?\"\nLooking at Il-mok's bizarre appearance, the three from the Heavenly Orchid Society smiled coldly.\n\"Seems like the Red Serpent Gang leader didn't tell you about us.\"\n\"He did.\"\n\"Oho. So you knew and still did it.\"\n\"What the Heavenly Orchid Society wants is the tribute amount. Not who's sending it.\"\n“Hahahaha. You get it, don’t you?”\n“So, what? You’re saying you’re taking over the Red Serpent Gang’s turf here in Gulang County?”\nIl-mok answered their question with a nod and a jerk of his chin toward the Red Serpent Gang’s estate.\n“How about we talk details inside?”\nIl-mok walked confidently toward the estate while simultaneously sending a telepathic message to the couple.\n—Get out of here while they’re following me.\nThe three from the Heavenly Orchid Society approached Il-mok without much suspicion, and meanwhile, the couple carefully retreated while watching for their chance.\nAnd the moment those bastards came within Il-mok's range, silver trajectories embroidered the air.\nA trajectory that sliced across the throat of the man walking in front.\nSwick.\nA delayed cutting sound echoed as the man's head separated from his neck and fell toward the ground.\nSwick!\nIl-mok's sword pierced the heart of another man who was belatedly drawing his blade.\n\"D-don't you fear the name of the Heavenly Orchid Society!\"\nThe man who had barely managed to draw his sword while his two companions died trembled as he shouted.\nHis earlier swagger was completely gone, leaving him pathetically screaming the name of his gang.\n“I don’t know why you think that bullshit works on me.”\nIl-mok approached the man and answered with an indifferent expression.\n“If I were scared of you, would I have done this?”\nRealizing that threats weren't working, the man suddenly swung his sword at Il-mok.\nHowever, the sword of the man in the angry mask pierced his heart faster than his own swing. Official source ıs novel(ꜰ)ire.net\n\"Kuk...\"\nJust after the man with the pierced heart collapsed with a choked groan—\n\"Forgive us, O Incarnation of Maitreya!!”\nSomeone's voice of repentance came from behind.\nWhen Il-mok turned around, he saw a woman kneeling on the ground, bowing toward him.\nIt was the wife who had been threatened by the Heavenly Orchid Society thugs earlier.\n\"I dared to doubt and defile that sacred name! Please punish me, but please, please spare my husband!”\nShe confessed her sin for selling the name Incarnation of Maitreya to the Heavenly Orchid Society thugs.\nShe had blurted it out to save her husband, but she also knew what had happened at that gathering.\nUnderstanding his wife's intention, the husband also quickly knelt down.\n“It-It was my fault, Incarnation of Matreiya! Kill me, but please, s-spare my wife!”\nIl-mok thought about how absurd this world was.\nThey were forced to do it with a knife on them and they still had to tremble and confess their sins like this.\n“Keep doing exactly that. From now on, if anyone asks, you tell them the Incarnation of Matreiya did it.\"\nThe couple just stared up at him, completely confused by his answer.\n\"Sell my name to the villains who seek me. Maitreya protects me, so no evil can kill me. And tell my name to anyone who wishes for salvation. Tell them the Incarnation of Maitreya will destroy all evil.\"\nThey were stunned silent for a second by his answer.\nThe couple bowed again toward the Incarnation of Maitreya.\n\"Th-thank you!!\"\n“We’ll make sure everyone hears how great Maitreya is!”\nWhen they finished bowing and looked up, the only things left in front of them were the three dead bodies.\nHaving quickly finished his business, Il-mok returned to the branch office with Dam Bin.\nOnly Il-mok had fought while wearing a mask to avoid exposing their identities. Dam Bin had been hiding nearby, ready to jump in just in case something went wrong.\n\"What do you plan to do now, Young Master?\"\nIl-mok took off his mask as he answered Dam Bin’s question.\n“What else? We’re going to wipe out the Heavenly Orchid Society.”\nHaving said that, Il-mok turned to address the Branch Leader.\n“How’s the money we recovered from the Red Serpent Gang?”\n“Mostly sorted, Young Master.”\n“Good. Give the people their share, send ten percent to headquarters like we discussed, and include a letter with the money.”\n\"A letter? What kind of letter?\"\n\"Just tell them to send people to Lanzhou.\"\nJin Hayeon, who had been listening to their conversation, asked.\n\"Are you planning to attack the Heavenly Orchid Society after reinforcements arrive?\"\nIl-mok shook his head.\n\"It takes more than a day or two to make a round trip from here to headquarters. How could I wait for that?\"\nThat answer left everyone who was listening with confused looks on their faces.\n\"Then why are you calling for reinforcements?\"\n\"They're not reinforcements. It’s manpower. We’ll need people to manage Lanzhou and Gansu Province after I’m done cleaning up those scums.”\nIl-mok looked toward the southeast where Lanzhou was located.\n\"We're attacking the Heavenly Orchid Society tonight.\"\nAfter all, a surprise attack works best when the other side has no idea it’s coming.",

    "content": "Chapter 190: Heavenly Orchid Society (2)\nThe Gulang County Branch Leader opened his mouth with a complicated expression.\n\"I'm not doubting your abilities, Young Master, but isn't this a bit dangerous? Even though Gansu Province is practically abandoned by the Central Plains, the Heavenly Orchid Society controls an entire provincial capital.\"\nThe moment the Branch Leader questioned his order, fanatics like Baek Cheon and Hyeokryeon Seon-ah were about to have a fit, but Il-mok spoke first.\n\"We already killed the messenger they sent. So our options are either to launch a surprise attack before this information reaches them or to hunker down here for a siege. And if we end up in a siege, we won't be the ones taking the real damage.\"\nEveryone gathered quickly realized who Il-mok meant by the real victims.\nThe innocent people living in Gulang County could suffer greatly, just like the couple Il-mok had saved earlier.\n\"And I'm not planning to fight recklessly. So tell me, what do you know about the Heavenly Orchid Society's combat strength? You must have something, either from your own digging or from the rumor mill, right?”\n\"The Heavenly Orchid Society’s leader, Maeng Gwak, is known as the Black Ghost Twin Sabers. They say no one’s actually seen him fight for more than ten years, not since the Heavenly Orchid Society took over Lanzhou. But there are rumors he used Force Qi in his last battle a decade ago.\"\n\"Force Qi... In Central Plains terms, that means the Supreme Peak Realm, right? Or the Realm of Truth (인해경(認解境))?\"\nIl-mok asked, recalling conversations with the Heavenly Demon.\nIt was back when he was getting ready to enter the Hall of the Demonic Way. Back when his Master would beat the crap out of him under the guise of \"real combat training,\" claiming Il-mok got stronger whenever he was in danger.\nIl-mok, who seriously thought he might actually die, often asked questions to buy time whenever their sparring sessions ended.\nOne of those questions was about the classification of martial realms.\n—The realms of martial arts...\nThe Heavenly Demon stroked his beard and briefly explained the martial realms.\nThose who had just succeeded in gathering internal energy in their dantian and were just learning martial arts were Third Rate. Those who could use internal energy to perform techniques were Second Rate. Those who had surpassed simply following predetermined movements and could freely manipulate internal energy according to various actions were First Rate.\nThose who had gone beyond strengthening their bodies with internal energy and could project qi outward were called the Peak Realm. These are the people who can use things like Sword or Fist Qi.\nAmong Central Plains martial artists, reaching the Peak Realm is what makes you a ‘real expert.’\nOccasionally, there are those who could forcibly squeeze out Sword Qi through superior martial arts regardless of their actual skill and were separately called Upper First Rate.\n—Truly foolish and ignorant. Anyone who learns our Divine Cult's high-level Demonic Arts can succeed in projecting qi within a dozen years at the latest. Hahaha.\nEven while explaining, the Heavenly Demon couldn’t resist showing off his pride in the Divine Cult and dissing the people from the Central Plains.\nBut Il-mok couldn’t argue with the facts.\nNot a single graduate from the Hall of the Demonic Way failed to reach what was equivalent to the Peak Realm in Central Plains standards, and all the cultists from the main headquarters who worked in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's combat units or organizations were Peak Realm or higher.\nBut that wasn’t why he kept his mouth shut.\n'With the price of dealing with mental illness and falling into Qi Deviation on a daily basis, that is.’\nBut he couldn't voice such thoughts for the Heavenly Demon would've chopped his head off if he did.\nThe Heavenly Demon's explanation continued.\n—The Central Plains folks talk about a level called theSupreme Peak Realm after the Peak Realm, but the Supreme Peak Realm is like a mirage. It's just something they added because the gap between Peak Realm and the next realm, Realm of Truth, is too vast. Just like the false realm called the Upper First Rate Realm.\nOnce you reached the Peak Realm and could project your qi, the possibilities for growth were endless.\nTaking the sword as an example, one could go beyond Sword Qi to form Sword Barriers or create Sword Threads. Instead of just coating your sword with energy, you could shoot your Sword Qi at enemies far away, or control the qi to move with either hard or soft principles.\nAfter mastering all these different ways to use ki and having a ton of breakthroughs, the ultimate stage a swordsman in the Peak Realm could dream of reaching was when their Sword Qi formed into Sword Force.\nThus, the Central Plains people called warriors who could handle Force Qi masters of the Supreme Peak Realm.\n—But to freely manipulate Force Qi, one must ultimately enter the Realm of Truth. The Force Qi created at the so-called Supreme Peak level is just a cheap imitation they’re barely managing to force out.\nHaving already reached an insane level of power himself, the Heavenly Demon obviously looked down on the whole Supreme Peak idea.\n—Does that mean the criterion for entering the Realm of Truth is being able to freely manipulateForce Qi?\"\n—You've got the order backwards. It’s because you have entered the Realm of Truth that you can freely wield Force Qi.\n—???\nSeeing Il-mok's confused face, the Heavenly Demon added an explanation.\n—The criterion for the Realm of Truth is none other than the Overhaul Body Transformation (환골탈태 (換骨奪胎)). Your body changes into the form most suitable for the martial arts and your meridians become connected directly to the world. As a result, you are able to commune with the world. Once that happens, wielding Force Qi freely comes as a matter of course.\nHe then added, looking extremely proud of himself.\n—And this connects back to our Divine Cult. This is because we classify our ‘high-level Demonic Arts’ based on whether or not one can achieve the Overhaul Body Transformation and reach the Realm of Truth upon successfully achieving Transcendence.\n—In that case, does that mean I will achieve the Overhaul Body Transformation the moment I achieve Transcendence with the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword?\nOblivious of Il-mok’s newfound realization and despair of what a long and crazy path he had unwillingly just stepped on, the Heavenly Demon just kept on smiling proudly.\n—That’s right. Hahaha. So, time to get back to training.\nWhat loving words and terrible killing intent that was.\nCold sweat ran down Il-mok's back when he recalled how that conversation had ended.\nMisunderstanding Il-mok's expression, the Gulang County Branch Leader cautiously spoke.\n“It seems unlikely that the leader of the Heavenly Orchid Society has entered the Realm of Truth. The number of absolute masters in the Realm of Truth across the Central Plains could be counted on one hand. If he were that skilled, there'd be no reason for him to stay in this frontier.\"\n\"Then how many masters are there besides the leader?\"\n“Their second-in-command, a woman they call the Rakshasi of Gansu, is rumored to be at the absolute top of the Peak Realm. And there are about five or six other Peak Realm masters.\"\nAfter hearing all the Branch Leader's reports, Il-mok looked over his companions and nodded.\nMost of them were crazy, but their skills were reliable.\nAfter getting their gear ready, Il-mok and his crew started moving toward Lanzhou.\nGulang County and Lanzhou were relatively close, but this was only close by the standards of the massive landmass called the Central Plains. ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ novèlfire.net\nAfter running over three hundred miles without rest using lightness skills, they finally reached Lanzhou after the sun had completely set.\nGiven how fast they had traveled, they had earned themselves a head start of at least one day.\n\"Those guys who came to Gulang County are probably planning to stay the night and get treated by the Red Serpent Gang before going home. They won't notice anything wrong at the Heavenly Orchid Society until tomorrow at the very least. So we'll rest now and launch our surprise attack at the beginning of the Hour of Tiger (3-5 AM).\"\nAfter giving his orders, Il-mok washed off all the sweat from the long run and got about four hours of sleep.\nHe woke up near the end of the Hour of the Ox (1–3 AM), and the group ate some rice balls they’d gotten from the inn before heading out.\nThere was a huge estate located just a short distance from Lanzhou's red-light district.\nA sign hanging out front read [Heavenly Orchid Society]. The place was so big it made the Red Serpent Gang’s headquarters look like a shack.\nPerhaps due to its enormous size, the walls were much higher, and men stood guard with torches lit at regular intervals.\nYet, because they’ve been the undisputed ruler of Lanzhou for over ten years now, their guards are lax and complacent.\n\"Yaaaaawn.\"\n‘No day off tomorrow… guess I’ll have to go see Aeng-ran tonight.’\nThe guard was getting lost in some dirty thoughts as he stared at the red-light district next door when his daydream suddenly came to a stop.\n\"!?\"\nHe suddenly found himself unable to breathe and before he knew it, a thin black thread wrapped around his neck.\nSlice.\nBefore the man could resist, his neck was severed in two by the razor-thin black thread.\nBeside the man who'd instantly become a headless corpse, stood a woman who'd approached without anyone noticing hid in the shadows.\nA woman in tight black night clothes with a wrathful deity mask covering her face.\nEven with a torch right next to her, she remained undetected.\nThis was Dam Bin, the First Squad Leader of the Hidden Guard Pavilion.\nOnce she took care of the last target, she put out a torch as a signal.\nWith no one left alive to see it, a team of masked figures used the new patch of darkness to climb over the wall and into the Heavenly Orchid Society estate.\nOnce they were safely inside, they split up and spread out in all directions, either moving alone or in teams of three.\n‘Easier than I thought.’\nIl-mok split off from the others and moved to the center of the estate alone.\nBefitting the grand size of the estate, the interior was also filled with numerous pavilions and inner courtyards.\nJust as he was about to walk past one of the buildings, he suddenly stopped.\nTwo guards were posted together in the alley between two pavilions.\nIl-mok used stealth techniques to creep up on them.\nHe stopped a good distance away and unleashed Soul-Cutting Flash with his finger. He'd improvised the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword to create a finger projectile on the spot.\nA blast of energy, infused with the essence of his fast-sword style, flew from Il-mok’s finger and hit the guards’ paralysis and mute points.\nThey went down without a sound. Il-mok walked up, finished them off with a quick swing of his blackened sword, and kept moving.\nRight after he passed another building, a particularly splendid building appeared.\nFour guard warriors stood around the building, each monitoring the surroundings.\n'Jackpot.'\nThe whole mission had been thrown together at the last minute. While they could locate the estate since the Heavenly Orchid Society was famous enough, there hadn't been time to find out exactly where the leader slept.\nThat's why they'd spread out widely to search for the leader.\n‘I can’t believe they put it right in the middle and basically hung up a giant sign saying ‘THE LEADER SLEEPS HERE’.’\nDespite his exasperated feelings, Il-mok pondered as he looked at the leader's chamber.\nHe felt that secretly taking out the guards one by one would be a bad move.\n'If that leader really is a Supreme Peak Realm expert, my stealth skills won’t be enough to fool his senses completely.’\nThe chances were high that if he jumped one of the guards, the leader would feel the disturbance in the energy flow and wake up.\n‘Hit them hard and fast.’\nWith his mind made up, Il-mok took a deep breath and operated his dantian at full power.\nBOOM!!\nWith a thunderous explosion, Il-mok had already reached right in front of the guard protecting the building's west side.\nThe guard's eyes widened at the unexpected attack.\nHe didn't even have time to open his mouth to sound the alarm or put up a guard when Il-mok’s sword cut his body in half.\nSlash!\nHowever, Il-mok’s objective had never been a mere guard in the first place.\nThe Sword Qi erupted from Il-mok's sword went beyond the guard's body and sliced through the building's wall.\nCRASH!!\nAmid the tremendous explosion and rising dust, Il-mok swung his sword again to push away the dust as he entered the hall.\n'Damn hygiene obsession.'\nAfter clearing the dust, the hall's interior came into Il-mok's view.\nThere is a massive bed inside.\nThree women who'd barely covered their naked bodies with silk blankets looked at Il-mok with startled faces.\n\"You fucking bastard!!\"\nThe man who'd been lying with those women roared and quickly threw himself toward the twin blades beside the bed.\nThe whole disastrous scene almost made Il-mok squeeze his eyes shut. The voices in his head started going nuts.\n'My eyes are going to rot!!'\n—Cut off that hideous thing right now!!\nThe Heavenly Orchid Society leader who'd woken up was completely naked.",

After all, the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult didn't consider rolling around shameful either, and more importantly, the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword wasn't designed for one-hit kills.\nIl-mok relentlessly swung his sword at Society Leader Maeng Gwak who was desperately trying to get back on his feet.\nLiving up to its name, his Soul-Stealing sword art came in a dizzying, non-stop barrage.\nWhat seemed like swift strikes would suddenly twist mid-path and utilize the principle of illusory sword art, and sometimes his sword would fly in a straight line while the Sword Qi curved bizarrely to target vital points.\nCaught in that chaotic storm of steel, Maeng Gwak barely managed to block Il-mok's sword by alternating his twin sabers.\nClang! Clang!\nAnd when things got dicey, he'd throw himself to the ground again, rolling around to barely avoid getting his vital spots slashed.\nHaving lost the initiative to the surprise attack and begun the battle off-balance from rolling on the floor, Maeng Gwak couldn't even think about counterattacking.\nHe was barely dodging fatal strikes, but in just a few seconds, countless cuts had already appeared all over his body.\nBut looking at it from another angle, this meant Il-mok had failed to kill the Heavenly Orchid Society Leader with his surprise attack.\n“Guard the boss!”\n\"Kill him!\"\nThe three remaining bodyguards that Il-mok had ignored rushed at him from the sides and behind.\n\"Tsk.\"\nWith a soft click of his tongue, Il-mok pulled his sword back from the leader and instantly bolted to the left.\n\"Haaah!\"\nAs the bodyguard on the left thrust his spear with a battle cry, Il-mok thrust his sword out to greet it.\nClang!\nThe moment he heard the strange metallic sound, the spear-wielding guard’s face crumpled.\nClang!\nIn a bewildering turn of events, the deflected spear collided with the sword being swung by his comrade, creating another metallic clash.\nAfter effortlessly shutting down the guard's attack, Il-mok was already in his face.\nShunk!\nThe same sword that had deflected the spear pierced straight through the bodyguard's heart.\nThe remaining two bodyguards also had their throats and hearts pierced by Il-mok's sword, each taken down in a single exchange.\n“We’ve got intruders!”\n\"Everyone, get up!\"\nSuddenly, the air was filled with yells, screams, and the sound of ringing steel.\n\"I don't know where the hell you came from, you bastard, but today's gonna be your death day.\"\nMost importantly, Maeng Gwak had also steadied his stance and regulated his breathing.\nLooking at those murderous eyes and the Saber Qi continuously emanating from his twin sabers, Il-mok let out a sigh.\n“You had plenty of time to kill while your lackeys were biting the dust. Motherfucker, can’t you at least put on some clothes?”\nThe Heavenly Orchid Society Leader was still completely naked.\n\"Is it because you're bald? Got no sense of shame.\"\nWhen Il-mok frowned as if his eyes were rotting from the sight, Maeng Gwak's forehead twitched.\n\"That's rich coming from a coward who attacks in the middle of the night!\"\nWith furious eyes, Maeng Gwak roared as the Saber Qi swirled around his twin sabers began to condense.\n\"Die!\"\nWhile members of the Heavenly Orchid Society who had noticed the attack began to emerge from all sides, a different scene unfolded here.\n\"Hehe. You’ve got guts, coming here.”\n\"Looks like you came here wanting to be embraced by this old man.\"\nThe ones approaching Hyeokryeon Seon-ah were spouting lewd remarks with gleaming eyes.\nLike Il-mok and Dam Bin, Hyeokryeon Seon-ah also wore a mask, but her figure visible through the night clothes clearly showed she was a woman.\nThe problem was that the mask made it impossible to guess her age.\nNot that it mattered. These guys were from the Unorthodox Faction that dealt in human trafficking. Even if they’d known she was only fifteen, it wouldn't have stopped them.\nBut despite their crude remarks, Hyeokryeon Seon-ah showed no signs of fear or shame.\nOriginally, Il-mok had planned to exclude Hyeokryeon Seon-ah from this operation.\nIt was a pest-control job, which meant killing was going to be part of the job.\nIl-mok, with his 21st-century mindset, argued that this is too heavy a burden for a fifteen-year-old girl but sadly got his opinion shot down.\nThis was the medieval era, and their group was the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, whose purpose was to punish evil through martial arts.\nDam Bin, Jin Hayeon, and the others couldn't relate to Il-mok's perspective, and most importantly, Hyeokryeon Seon-ah also stubbornly insisted on participating.\nThis was the child who had followed him around with innocent smiles since childhood.\nEven though she had matured a bit, she was still just a kid trying to get a pat on the head from him.\nThat was Il-mok's image of Hyeokryeon Seon-ah, but the girl standing here wasn't so innocent.\nCrack!\nBefore anyone could react, Hyeokryeon Seon-ah's red fingernails had pierced through the heart of the black-clothed man who'd been running his mouth.\nEven as the violently beating heart spurted blood and her face was stained red with gore, Hyeokryeon Seon-ah looked at the remaining bastard with an indifferent expression.\n“Anyone who gets in my big brother’s way dies.”\n\"What the hell—?\"\nHe murmured with a dazed expression, but never got to finish.\nBefore he knew it, the girl's fingernails were embedded in his throat.\nJin Hayeon, who had been watching the blood-stained girl begin her massacre of the unorthodox faction members, soon turned her head away.\n‘…To think my role is that of a babysitter.’\nUnlike Dam Bin and Il-mok moved independently, she was in charge of supervising two people.\n“Hahahaha! That’s it, keep coming! I’ll give you all a spectacular show of my skills as a send-off to the afterlife!\"\nWorse, one of them was a complete attention whore. The second their cover was blown, he started yelling his head off while chucking hidden weapons everywhere.\n\"Could you keep your mouth shut while fighting, Young Master Baek Cheon?\"\nTrue to her babysitting role, she nagged at Baek Cheon and let out a light sigh.\nStill, she knew it couldn’t be helped. This was a surprise attack launched without knowing the exact location of the Heavenly Orchid Society Leader.\nThe personnel distribution was meant to prevent anyone from getting seriously injured or killed if they happened to run into the Society Leader while moving separately.\nTrue to her White Hand Demonic Art, she quickly cleared her mind of distracting thoughts to press her palms together and draw up the cold energy stored in her dantian.\nBecause she looked so defenseless, the bunch who'd been intimidated by Baek Cheon and Hyeokryeon Seon-ah came rushing at her in a group.\nThe moment the black-clothed mob got within close range...\nJin Hayeon separated her pressed palms and spun in a circle like a dancer waving a fan.\nThe frost energy she had been compressing between her hands was finally set free, erupting outwards and following the path of her dance.\nCrackle.\nEvery single one of those who had been approaching her froze solid where they stood, their eyes bulging wide from the intense pain they felt throughout their bodies.\nJin Hayeon looked at those who had frozen solid with severe frostbite all over their bodies with indifferent eyes, then swung her palms in succession.\nThud!\nWith every dull thud, another frozen body exploded into pieces.\nIt didn't even feel like people were exploding; it was more like something non-living shattering into bits, like hitting a frozen slab of beef with a mallet.\nAfter wiping out a dozen thugs in the blink of an eye, she continued swinging her hands with cold energy swirling around them.\nThose who got hit by her palms had their organs freeze and died on the spot.\nAs Jin Hayeon continued eliminating the scums who had been leading the human trafficking in Gansu Province alongside Hyeokryeon Seon-ah and Baek Cheon...\nClang!\nFor the first time, opponents who could actually block them appeared.\n“Who the hell do you crazy bastards think you are, coming here?!”\n\"Hehe. The damage you've caused today will have to be repaid with your bodies.\"\nArmed men with dangerous auras emanating from their weapons appeared.\nAs the Heavenly Orchid Society's scoundrels were running around the vast estate in panic from the sudden attack...\nSlash!\n\"?!\"\nThe pupils of a man following behind dilated at the bizarre sight of his comrade's body suddenly being cut down.\nThanks to the blood spurting from his comrade's body, the man belatedly realized why his colleague had died.\n\"Wire...?\"\nThe moonlight, reflecting off the blood, revealed a black thread tied to the roof tiles of a pavilion.\nBut figuring out what killed his comrade wasn’t going to change his own destiny.\n“You catch on faster than I’d expect from someone of your caliber.”\nThe moment a woman's sweet voice was heard, he felt a strange stinging sensation in his neck, like being bitten by an insect.\nLowering his gaze at the bizarre sensation, the man saw the black thread that had pierced through his neck.\nAfter that, she hunted down the Unorthodox scums with wires like a spider hunting with its web.\nWhenever the woman stepped, the scums limbs and necks were chopped by the spider web that Dam Bin had laid out.\nSlash!\n\"Gasp!\"\nBut then. Dıscover more novels at n0velfire.net\nClang!\nThe only woman among the scums managed to successfully block Dam Bin's wire with her sword.\nNot only that, she followed the thread back to its source, pinpointed Dam Bin's hiding spot, and immediately launched an attack.\nSwoooosh!\nDam Bin dodged the Sword Qi flying toward her with light footwork and spoke with an enigmatic smile.\n\"Judging by your skill, you must be the Vice Leader.\"\n\"And who the hell are you?\"\nDam Bin answered leisurely.\n\"Just a servant who serves a great person.\"\n“A common whore has no business being here.”\nBut Dam-bin just took the insult in stride. Her faint smile never wavered, showing her age and experience.\n\"Then may I ask why you, Vice Leader, are in the business of selling fellow women as prostitutes?\"\n“That’s hilarious. You really don’t get it, do you? This is a dog-eat-dog world. The strong take what they want from the weak. Gender has nothing to do with it.\"\nWhen she heard the Vice Leader's confident answer, Dam Bin's smile deepened.\n\"I see. I guess you’ll have no complaints.”\n\"Complaints?\"\nThe moment the Vice Leader asked...\n“When I take your life from you.”\nCountless black threads exploded into the air around them.\nThe entire time they were talking, Dam Bin had been secretly spreading her black threads all over the place.\n\"Coward!\"\nThe shocked Vice Leader quickly raised her sword to gather her Sword Qi.\nJudging by how easy she handles the Sword Qi, it’s obvious that she has reached the end of the Peak Realm.\nThe black wires that touched the Vice Leader's Sword Qi were cut as easily as straw.\nBut for every thread she sliced through, ten more seemed to take its place.\nSlash!\nSlash!\nThe Vice Leader repeatedly cut down or blocked those wires with her Sword QI, swinging her blade covered in sword silk non-stop like she was clearing away actual spider webs.\nAnd yet, for some reason…\nEven though she easily cut down the wire, the Vice Leader felt increasingly like a butterfly trapped in a spider web. Struggling desperately, only to end up tangling itself deeper.\nAnd the moment the Vice Leader swung her sword again to cut through a bundle of wire...\nShunk.\nA single, fine black thread shot out from Dam Bin’s extended right hand and went straight through the Vice Leader’s heart.\nThe pain hit her a second later. She looked down and saw a wire penetrating her heart.\n\"Cough...\"\nShe choked up a mouthful of blood and spoke with a desperate voice.\n\"P-please spare me...\"\nHowever, what came back to her was a cold sneer.\nHeh.\nIt was the very same sneer she used to give the women she sold.",

    "content": "Chapter 192: Heavenly Orchid Society (4)\nThud.\nDam Bin glanced down for a second at the Vice Leader’s body, which had crumpled to the floor after a pathetic final plea.\nThen she quickly turned away with a look of complete disinterest.\n'Hayeon's group should be doing fine with that kid leading them.'\nShe turned her gaze away from the direction Jin Hayeon, Hyeokryeon Seon-ah, and Baek Cheon had headed, and looked toward where Il-mok had gone.\n\"Looks like the Eighth Disciple has run into the Society Leader.\"\nShe could feel it from that surge of energy from earlier.\nEven though there was quite a distance between them, the energy wave had been so intense that it reached all the way to her.\n'So the rumors were true. Their Society Leader is a bona fide Supreme Peak Realm master.’\nShe made up her mind in an instant and started heading in Il-mok's direction.\n'Even though the Eighth Young Master is starting to get past the Extremity, a master of that caliber might be too much for him to take on alone.'\nIt is said that achieving Transcendence with high-level Demonic Art enables the practitioner to undergo an Overhaul Body Transformation and step into the Realm of Truth. But for a practitioner of high-level Demonic Art that only mastered the art to Extremity, they are no different from what the people of the Central Plain called Peak Realm masters. This update ıs available on novel-fire.ɴet\nMoreover, most of the cultists struggled with this Extremity stage, with many going mad in the end.\nIt had nothing to do with talent. You needed an iron will to power through the horrific side effects at that level, and most people just couldn't bear the madness.\nA prime example was the Third Young Master, Seo Wan-pyeong. He had reached the Extremity stage in his early twenties thanks to his exceptional talent, but remained stuck there for nearly a decade.\nThe biggest reason the Third Young Master had been able to break through was thanks to Il-mok's existence.\nAnd Il-mok, the very person who had guided Seo Wan-pyeong’s development, had also begun to move past Extremity at the tender age of eighteen after grasping the basic principle of Force Qi.\nBut if you look at another angle, the Heavenly Orchid Society Leader was a fully matured warrior who had grasped Force Qi way longer than Il-mok and an opponent difficult for him to handle.\nShe started heading over to back Il-mok up, just in case.\n'...Those kids are a bit scatterbrained, but they shouldn't run into the Society Leader or another Vice Leader, so they should be safe.'\nDam Bin looked somewhere in the distance with a slightly worried expression.\nAt one corner of the Heavenly Orchid Society's massive estate.\n\"Get out of the way!\"\n\"Haaah!\"\n\"......\"\nA team of three—a saber guy, a spear girl, and an archer—was making a whole lot of noise as they tore through a mob of thugs.\nOr rather, two boisterous individuals and one quiet archer were wiping them out.\nAll sorts of Qis and arrows flew everywhere, slaughtering about twenty thugs in an instant.\n“So where to now, Senior Ouyang?”\nThe spear wielder asked the saber guy in a cold tone dripping with hostility.\nThis was a far cry from the usual Ju Seo-yeon, the girl who was normally all bright eyes and \"Jin Hayeon this, Jin Hayeon that!\"\nYou'd think they'd have a bond, since they both worship the ground Jin Hayeon walks on, but nope. Ju Seo-yeon absolutely loathed Ouyang Mun.\nAnd, as Jin Hayeon’s number one fan, she’d seen right through him from the start.\nOuyang Mun might look similar to her on the surface, but they weren't the same kind of person.\n'That disgusting bastard, how dare he!'\nUnlike her own pure admiration for Jin Hayeon, Ouyang Mun harbored filthy lustful desires.\nOf course, calling it disgusting or lustful was purely from Ju Seo-yeon's perspective.\nEven though Ju Seo-yeon was shooting daggers at him with her eyes, Ouyang Mun was so lost in his own little world that he just answered her cheerfully.\n\"Obviously we should head toward where Hayeon went.\"\n“I don’t trust your reasons, but I'll accept your suggestion.\"\nSince she was just as desperate to see Jin Hayeon again, Ju Seo-yeon had no problem agreeing with the creep.\nJust as the two were about to take off...\n\"I-I think we should go help the Y-Young Master instead...\"\nThe archer, who hadn't spoken a single word until now, stammered out.\n\"Miss Jeong, what are you talking about?\"\nOuyang Mun and Ju Seo-yeon both stopped in their tracks and stared at Jeong Hyeon in complete confusion.\nBut Jeong Hyeon had used up her entire day's supply of courage on that one sentence and couldn't say another word.\nOuyang Mun stared at the trembling girl for a second, and then it was like a lightbulb went off over his head.\n\"Ah! Now I get it! Hayeon will obviously move to help the Young Master. In that case, it'd be much better if we help the Young Master directly!\"\nThrough the energy wave he had felt from the estate’s central area, Ouyang Mun had also discerned that Il-mok had clashed with the Society Leader.\nAnd if he had noticed, then Jin Hayeon surely had as well.\nWhich meant…\n'This is my chance! I'll dive in and get hurt saving the Young Master! Then Hayeon will hold me in her arms!!'\nAs expected, Ouyang Mun’s head was filled with nothing but thoughts of Jin Hayeon.\n'I have to be first! There's no way I'm letting that creep get a hug from Senior Hayeon!'\nUnfortunately, there happened to be another crazy person here with the exact same mindset.\n\"Let's hurry!\"\n\"We absolutely must save the Young Master!\"\nJeong Hyeon watched the two of them suddenly get all excited and take off running and finally managed to let out the breath she'd been holding.\n\"Haah.\"\nShe had a thought.\n‘N-Next time… I have to a-ask… ask the Young Master to place me in a d-different people.’\nOf course, whether she'd ever work up the nerve to actually say that to Il-mok was a whole other story.\nMeanwhile, the woman that Ouyang Mun and Ju Seo-yeon were desperately searching for was in the middle of fierce combat with her companions.\nThe scoundrels blocking their path were all executives of the Heavenly Orchid Society who had reached the Peak Realm.\nAmong them, Hyeokryeon Seon-ah was facing off against a spear wielder.\nClang!\nShe swung her crimson energy-wreathed right hand, barely managing to deflect the spear crackling with Spear Qi, then launched herself forward.\nShe was trying to get inside the spear wielder's range.\nBut despite Hyeokryeon Seon-ah's nimble movements, she couldn't quite manage to break through into the spear wielder's inner range.\nBeing able to use Fist Qi at her age was a talent worthy of being called a genius, but she was only fifteen years old.\nFacing a middle-aged master who had experienced countless real battles as a member of the Unorthodox Faction wasn't easy.\nIl-mok's starting to overcome the Extremity stage at eighteen was the only abnormality here. He was just a freak of nature in the context of martial arts.\nIn fact, the middle-aged spear wielder couldn't even imagine that his opponent was only fifteen.\nThis wasn’t just because Hyeokryeon Seon-ah was wearing a mask; she had also reached a level that should have been impossible at fifteen.\nClang!\nHe once again shoved her back right as she tried to dart in and take advantage of an opening.\nThe middle-aged spear wielder, Jang Sul, silently sighed inside.\nIt wasn't because of the creepy red lady trying her best to kill him.\n'Shit. Where the hell did these experts pop out from?'\nAnd the crazy part was—and he couldn't decide if this was good luck or bad—the red-clad woman he was fighting was the weakest of the three.\n“Hahahaha! You really think you can catch me with footwork like that?”\nThe maniac who'd been chattering nonstop was throwing hidden weapons while darting around just as fast as he talked.\nAnd the saber wielder facing that maniac was already covered in wounds.\nHe was a tough old bastard from the underworld, so nothing fatal had landed yet, but…\n\"You bastard!!\"\nHis eyes had already rolled back from his opponent's insults and dirty tactics.\nBut the guy getting harassed by hidden weapons was actually the lucky one.\n\"Huff... huff...\"\nThe swordsman facing the ice lady was breathing out little white clouds with every gasp.\nThis meant the ice technique's cold energy had already penetrated his body.\nThe swordsman's movements had also become sluggish.\nJang Sul knew from experience that the swordsman would lose his life soon.\n'Shit.'\nJang Sul's face contorted.\nHe was only able to see how bad things were because he was fighting the weakest of the bunch.\nAt this rate, they were all going to die.\nSensing mortal danger, Jang Sul's mind began digging through past memories to survive and soon a particular memory surfaced.\nIce-wielding woman.\nRed-haired lady wielding blood-colored Fist Qi...\n\"You're Demonic Cult bastards!\"\nHe suddenly remembered some stories he’d heard about the Demonic Cult’s signature Demonic Ars.\nThe White Hand Demonic Art was a famous Demonic Art, and the Blood Fox Crimson Claw Art was also well-known as a martial art of the Hyeokryeon Family.\nAnd this was Gansu Province, practically a neighbour to Xinjiang where the Demonic Cult was based. Of course, you'd hear stories about them around here.\nHearing Jang Sul’s words, the saber wielder also came to a rough understanding of the martial art used by the lunatic who had been chattering loudly while throwing hidden weapons here and there.\n\"So a direct descendant of the Five Great Demonic Houses fights this dirty!\"\nThe most famous hidden weapon family in the Demonic Cult was the Baek Family.\nBut knowing their identities didn't change much.\nActually, Jang Sul had made a huge mistake.\nHad he kept the realization of their identities to himself, things might have been different, but he had to go and shout it for the world to hear.\n\"Uhahaha! What are you talking about! We are Incarnations of Maitreya!\"\nWhile Baek Cheon spouted ridiculous excuses and put on an exaggerated act...\n\"Haah.\"\nJin Hayeon let out a light sigh and thrust both hands forward, unleashing a massive wave of pure frost from her hands.\n\"Kraaaah!\"\nThe swordsman, already on his last legs, let out a final scream and swung his sword.\nCrack!!\nBut his sword, which had already taken a beating from her Demonic Art, couldn't handle the chill any longer and just exploded into bits.\nAfter Jin Hayeon's hands broke through the swordsman's sword and touched his chest.\nThud.\nWith a sickening wet crunch of shattering bone, the swordsman coughed up a lungful of blood and fell.\nWitnessing his comrade's fall, Jang Sul gritted his teeth.\n'I'll die too at this rate.'\nDesperate, Jang Sul gripped his spear tightly and unleashed the life-saving ultimate technique he'd been hiding, trying to push back the crimson woman who kept buzzing around him like a mosquito.\nJang Sul planned to push back that damn bitch and then run. An unorthodox warrior had no obligation to risk his life for his comrades.\nBut why was it...\nDespite the fierce energy erupting from Jang Sul's spear, the crimson woman didn't retreat.\nNo, she actually threw herself toward the massive Spear Qi Jang Sul had created.\nEven facing the sharp, deadly spear energy that could pierce flesh and cut through bone and muscle with just a graze, her eyes held no fear whatsoever.\nThe only emotion in those eyes was simple.\n'My big brother's enemies are my enemies.'\nIt was nothing less than a blind, fanatical faith.\nWith movements so bold they seemed to disregard her life, Hyeokryeon Seon-ah finally broke into Jang Sul's inner range.\n‘Exterminate.'\nIn a flash, her red nails plunged into his chest and found his heart.\nCrunch.\nEven as the sickening sound of a bursting heart filled the air, even after she’d just taken down a master who was way stronger than her, Hyeokryeon Seon-ah turned her head with a completely emotionless expression, already looking for her next target.\n\"Tsk.\"\nThen a disappointed clicking sound came from her mouth.\nThe remaining saber wielder was already freezing to death from Jin Hayeon's ice techniques.\n\"Young Master Baek, clean up those guys trying to escape.\"\nHaving already handled the saber wielder herself, she put Baek Cheon on clean-up duty, and he started chucking a storm of hidden weapons.\nThey couldn't leave anyone alive who knew who they were.\nJust as she was getting bummed out that there were no more bugs left to squash for her brother...\nBOOM!!\nA thunderous crash echoed from the center of the Heavenly Orchid Society's estate.\nRight from where Il-mok had gone.",

    "content": "Chapter 193: Heavenly Orchid Society (5)\nA short while before.\n\"No, you don’t?!\"\nSeeing Maeng Gwak trying to form his Force Qi, Il-mok wasted no time and lashed out with his sword.\nWhoooosh!\nIl-mok's Sword Qi sliced through space, flying toward Maeng Gwak. But the Heavenly Orchid Society Leader simply held his twin sabers and effortlessly neutralized the attack.\nThe energy gathering around his blades had already surpassed the level of Saber Silks and was approaching true Saber Force.\nBut Il-mok knew that already.\nSwish!\nThe moment he released his Sword Qi, Il-mok used his movement technique to close in on Maeng Gwak, swinging his sword in an incredibly intricate pattern that somehow avoided the extended reaches entirely.\nBut Maeng Gwak was the boss of a shady faction for a reason; he'd been in too many fights to get rattled.\n\"Hmph.\"\nWith a snort, Maeng Gwak swung the saber in his right hand to meet Il-mok's sword.\nClang clang clang!\nMeanwhile, a series of metallic ringing sounds echoed from the left saber as he swung it at another angle. This was the result of him blocking the sneaky Sword Qi that Il-mok had dispatched using the sublime principles of the Traceless Soul-Slicing Sword.\nIl-mok had mixed in the principles of the Sixth Secret Technique, the Northern Wind Soul-Severing Strike, with his Traceless Soul-Cutting Sword by spinning the Sword Qi to increase its cutting power. But Maeng Gwak saw through his strike and blocked it easily.\nWhen Maeng Gwak's right saber clashed with Il-mok's sword, a thunderous boom echoed through the air.\nBOOM!\nIl-mok's sword now had Sword Silks coiled around it, and those threads carried a strange repelling force.\nHe'd used the Second Secret Technique - the Soul-Rebounding Sword to the Sword Silks like a repelling barrier.\nIt was an absurd display of skill, but it ultimately failed.\n\"That's enough of your little tricks!\"\nMaeng Gwak roared and swung his left saber, the one that had blocked the Traceless Soul-Cutting assault.\nAs Maeng Gwak's saber came flying with enough force to cut him in half, Il-mok calmly circulated his internal energy.\nThe Sword Silks that had been forming the repelling force now clung to Maeng Gwak's right saber as if they were one body and Il-mok spun with his sword like he was dancing.\nClang!\nUsing the principle of Floral Substitution, Il-mok made Maeng Gwak's twin sabers crash into each other. Then he immediately withdrew his sword and launched a series of thrusts.\nHis thrusts focused on speed, one after another.\nWhile Il-mok's sword movements were simple and fast, the Sword Qi flowing from his blade was flexible. Some of it would curve in mid-air, while other hides behind other Sword Qi like a hidden weapon.\nIt was a bizarre and unpredictable display of sword mastery, controlling both sword and Qi with complete freedom.\nClang!\nClang clang!\nBut Maeng Gwak managed to block the chain of attacks by using minimal movements.\nAnd when that overlapping Saber Qi reached its peak—\n\"This is the end!\"\nWith a roar, Maeng Gwak's twin sabers cut through Il-mok's Sword Qi and flew toward him.\nTch.\nIl-mok realized that the Heavenly Orchid Society Leader had finally managed to form a true Saber Force on his twin weapons. He barely managed to pull back and narrowly dodged the strike.\nBut with his rhythm broken, now it was Maeng Gwak's turn to go on the offensive.\n\"Hahaha! Let's see you dodge this too!\"\nMeng Guo wasn't just carrying two sabers to look cool; his martial arts were just as bizarre and unpredictable as Il-mok's.\nHis left and right blades carved different paths through the air, attacking relentlessly without pause.\nWhat made it especially troublesome was that his twin blades were now wrapped in true Force Qi. If Il-mok tried to clash directly, both his sword and his body risked being cut clean in half.\n—What are you waiting for!\n—Use the move from that day and chop that disgusting body to bits!!\nThat useless bastard also started nagging in his mind.\nMaeng Gwak's right blade came flying toward Il-mok, who had just dodged the left blade.\nRealizing that dodging was not a viable option, Il-mok gritted his teeth.\n‘Shut the fuck up, you useless yapping motherfucker!’\nUsing his anger toward his alter ego as fuel, Il-mok drew massive amounts of internal energy from his dantian and mixed all the principles of his techniques together into one strike.\nIl-mok's sword clashed with Maeng Gwak's right saber, creating a thunderous sound.\nBOOM!\nIl-mok's sword now had its own constellation of overlapping Sword Qi.\n\"So you really have reached the Supreme Peak Realm.\"\nHe was acting like he’d already figured it out from all of Il-mok’s fancy moves. Maeng Gwak sneered even as sweat poured down his face.\n\"Tch.\"\nIl-mok got pushed back by the pure power of the impact and clicked his tongue in annoyance.\n'Should've spent more time training back at the Hall of the Demonic Way.’\nIt wasn't his sword skills he regretted slacking on. When it came to pure technique, he felt like he was holding his own.\nThe problem was internal energy.\nHe’d only gotten away without a serious injury because he’d used a fancy trick to redirect most of the force. If he’d taken that hit straight on, he’d be spitting up blood right now.\n\"Huu. Die!\"\nTaking a deep breath, Maeng Gwak swung his twin sabers at Il-mok again in rapid succession.\nIl-mok used his footwork and lightness skills to dodge the attacks, occasionally interrupting the man's rhythm with precise thrusts.\nAnd when he absolutely couldn't avoid an attack—\nBOOM!\nHe’d have to grit his teeth and form Sword Force again to block, then use the rebound to pull back.\nIt was his only choice.\nAlthough he had grasped the basic principle of Force in the process of fighting the leader of the fanatic force, handling true Force Qi was still beyond Il-mok's current abilities.\nNot only did forming the Force Qi take time, but most importantly, he lacked internal energy.\nIf he used it too many times, his dantian would be completely drained in an instant.\nBut even as he kept getting pushed back, Il-mok's eyes remained calm.\n‘Apart from lacking internal energy, this fight is totally winnable.’\nHis opponent's level was similar to that fanatic leader he'd fought before.\n\"Huff, huff.\"\nAnd for a supposed master with all that power and experience, the man was as slow as a brick.\nWhoosh.\nIl-mok stepped back lightly and smirked.\n“Seriously, how lazy do you have to be for your body to end up like that?\"\nThe guy called himself a martial artist, but he had a potbelly you could rest a drink on.\nThis was a real problem for Il-mok. He found ripped, muscle-bound dudes gross when they were half-naked, so the sight of a flabby guy fighting naked was enough to make his inner germaphobe start screaming.\n‘They said no one's seen him fight since he took over the city.'\nHe'd probably gotten soft after becoming the big boss of Lanzhou.\n“Hahhh. Shut your mouth!”\nMaybe it was because of the potbelly comment, but a vein started throbbing on Maeng Gwak’s forehead as he charged in again.\n“Easy there, you’ll die of high blood pressure at this rate.”\nBeing overweight means you gotta watch out for high blood pressure anyway.\nIl-mok clicked his tongue and used his lightness skill to dodge the heavy man's twin sabers.\n\"I'll help you lose that belly fat. Hahaha.\"\nWith his ragebaiting success, Il-mok calmly waited for his chance.\n\"Grrr! You damn pest!\"\nThe second the furious Maeng Gwak swung his sabers again—\nNow!\nIl-mok, who'd been studying Maeng Gwak's techniques, moved boldly.\nSwish.\nIl-mok's sword, now wrapped in Force Qi, shot toward Maeng Gwak's right saber.\nThud.\nBut somehow, when Il-mok's sword met Maeng Gwak's right saber, it didn't produce the same explosive sound as before.\nThat was because Il-mok had read his opponent's technique and struck it with a deflecting blow rather than clashing directly.\nThanks to this, Maeng Gwak's right saber was knocked off course and flew toward his own left blade.\nBOOM!\nAs the Force Qi from both sabers crashed into each other—\nSlice.\nA sharp cutting sound rang out as Il-mok’s sword slashed open the man’s lower abdomen.\n\"Kuk...\"\nMaeng Gwak let out a choked groan, quickly hunching over and pressing both hands to his torn belly as blood and organs tried to spill out.\nIl-mok looked down at the pathetic sight.\n\"Congratulations. You managed to lose some weight right before dying.\"\nJust as Il-mok swung his sword toward the collapsed Heavenly Orchid Society Leader's neck—\nSlice!\nSharp cutting sounds echoed around Il-mok.\nBut Il-mok wasn't surprised. He'd already sensed what was happening around him.\n“My thanks, First Squad Leader Dam Bin.\"\nHe looked past a pile of thugs whose arms and legs had just been lopped off by black threads as Dam Bin stepped out of the darkness.\n\"I only did what needed to be done, Young Master. But that was truly magnificent swordsmanship.\"\nShe'd arrived near the end of Il-mok and the Society Leader's battle, but instead of rashly joining the fight, she decided to observe.\nThough it looked like Il-mok was being pushed back, his eyes remained remarkably calm.\n‘The Eighth Young Master might gain some enlightenment from this battle.’\nSince the Demonic Cult revered martial prowess, they believed there was nothing more valuable than a real do-or-die battle between masters.\nThat was not to say she had been idle. She'd been preparing for contingencies. That's how she was able to instantly slaughter the thugs who tried to ambush Il-mok right after the battle.\n\"At this rate, achieving Transcendence before thirty isn't impossible.\"\nHearing her praise, Il-mok clicked his tongue with a disappointed expression.\n\"I wish that were true.\"\nUnfortunately, Il-mok hadn't gained any special insights from this battle despite his opponent being quite strong.\nShaking off his disappointment, Il-mok looked up and surveyed his surroundings. Specifically, the carnage that Dam Bin's black threads had created. Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on NoveI★Fire.net\n\"If you don't mind, can I ask you something?\"\n\"Please ask freely.\"\n\"Which Demonic Art are you cultivating, and what's the side effect?\"\nNot only did he find the thread-wielding art fascinating, but he was also struck by an ominous premonition that a master of her caliber would surely have a side effect that was just as formidable.\n\"My Demonic Art is called the Dark Spider Blood Thread Art, and the side effect is similar to that of the White Hand Demonic Art.\"\n\"Dark Spider’s crimson thread. That is a name truly befitting a Demonic Art.”\n“You’re too kind, Young Master.”\nHe'd meant it was creepy, but Dam Bin took it as a compliment.\n\"Hmm. Weird that you have the same side effect as Miss Jin. You two give off a totally different aura, so I never would’ve guessed.”\nWhen he said that, Dam Bin smiled.\nAnd it was a weird smile.\nSure, she smiled sometimes back when she was in her servant uniform, but those were always calm, gentle smiles.\nThis one in her black night clothes had an inexplicably bewitching quality.\nIl-mok wondered if it was because of her outfit, but then—\n\"It's similar to the side effects when a man cultivates it, not when a woman does.\"\nHer words hit him, and a memory from long ago came flooding back.\n'The side effect for guys... Don't tell me it's THAT ONE!?'\nLooking at her unusually seductive and predatory gaze, Il-mok gulped.\n‘Oh shit.’\nA few days earlier.\nDeep within the Murim Alliance headquarters located near Dongting Lake, an important meeting was taking place.\nIt was a conference to determine a response to the Demonic Cult, which had been showing strange movements for the past three years or so.\nExcept… pretty much everyone at the meeting looked like they were about to lose their minds.\n\"Ha! Not only was he freely wielding Sword Qi at sixteen, but at seventeen he mastered sorcery and saved a village suffering from drought, and two months later he was using true Force Qi? Do you really think this makes any sense?\"\nThe reason was Il-mok.\nMore specifically, it was the news that all the weird stuff the Demonic Cult had been up to was because of their youngest Young Master.\nWhen the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord received this news, he ordered an additional investigation into the Eighth Young Master. The results were now being presented at this meeting.\n“I know Demonic Arts are fast, but this is just ridiculous.”\n“Not even the current Heavenly Demon, Hyeokryeon Il-hwi, was ever this good and this fast. And that guy’s a monster within their cult’s history. ”\n\"Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord, how exactly are you handling this?\"\nThe problem was that most of the information in the report was completely unbelievable.\n‘Fuck that Eighth Young Master.’\nHe was getting chewed out just for reporting the crazy rumors he'd gathered, and he had to fight down the urge to go and personally murder the kid.",

    "content": "Chapter 194: Heavenly Orchid Society (6)\nWhile arrows of criticism were flying toward the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord, an elder from the Namgung Family spoke up.\n\"Now, now. There's no need to blame the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord. He's just compiling information that has been circulating in Xinjiang. The way I see it, this is probably just another case of those fanatics idolizing their cult.\"\nA few of those attending the meeting nodded as if they found this reasonable.\n\"Or maybe the rumors have just gotten blown way out of proportion. You know what they say, a rumor without legs can travel a thousand li, and it gets bigger with every person who passes it along.\"\nThis time, an elder from the Wudang Sect offered another opinion.\nEither way, both opinions amounted to not believing the rumors.\n\"Tch. Those Demonic Cult bastards are idiots as usual.\"\nThe elder from Mount Hua Sect seemed to agree with both views, clicking his tongue dismissively as he disparaged the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nTrue to as an elder from Mount Hua—the sect that had been devastated and rebuilt after the Kongtong Sect annihilation—he showed absolute hostility toward the Demonic Cult.\nBut strangely enough, that malice was closer to 'contempt' or 'disdain.'\nThis was evident in that he was not insisting they should immediately hunt down those bastards and wipe them out.\nWhich made a certain kind of sense. It had been over six hundred years since the Kongtong Sect was annihilated by the Heavenly Demon of that era.\nOn top of that, it had been over two hundred years since the Demonic Cult was driven to Xinjiang, so revenge was pretty much already achieved.\nMount Hua's last direct clash with the Demonic Cult was during the previous Heavenly Demon’s reign about ninety years ago, so any desire for revenge naturally faded over time.\nIt was so long ago that hardly anyone who participated in those battles was still alive.\nOf course, their ideological indoctrination continued even now.\nIf you asked any Mount Hua disciple, \"Who is our main enemy?\" they'd answer, \"The Demonic Cult!\" without hesitation.\nBut honestly, Mount Hua disciples had other people they really wanted to tear apart.\nNamely, their competitors who fought them almost daily for dominance in Shaanxi Province, the Zhongnan Sect.\nThis was also true for the Qingcheng and Diancang Sects in similar situations.\nQingcheng was too busy dealing with their rivals in Sichuan, and Diancang was stuck between a rock and a hard place with the Sichuan powers above them and the Hainan Sect to the east.\n“Tsk. We wasted all this time and effort worrying about the Demonic Cult’s garbage.”\nSince the rumors about the Eighth Young Master of the Demonic Cult were so absurd, the meeting attendees eventually lost interest in the topic.\nInstead, they started bringing up topics related to their own sects' interests one by one.\nThe meaningless meeting dragged on for quite a while.\nRight after the colossal waste of time finally ended, the Chief Strategist Gongsun Hyeon called the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord aside.\n\"You've had a hard time.\"\nAt Gongsun Hyeon's praise, the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord suppressed his resentment and replied.\n\"I only did what needed to be done, Chief Strategist.”\nThe reason he had revealed the rumors about Il-mok exactly as they were in the meeting today was because of the Chief Strategist’s directive.\nThanks to those orders, the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord had endured insulting remarks from various elders, but he didn't question the Chief Strategist about it or ask why it had to be done.\nThe Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord believed that when a superior gives an order, a subordinate should carry it out without question.\nOf course, this also meant he expected his subordinates to act the same way when he gave them orders.\nBut Chief Strategist Gongsun Hyeon was a bit different.\n\"Aren't you curious why I specifically told you to relay such absurd rumors as they were?\"\nHe believed that people needed to understand the purpose of their work to follow through properly.\nOf course, he was only speaking up because he had accurately grasped the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord's personality.\n\"I simply do my best to carry out whatever the Chief Strategist orders.\"\nGongsun Hyeon smiled faintly at the perfectly straight answer from his perfectly loyal man.\n\"I did it on purpose. I wanted the Nine Sects and One Gang, and the Seven Great Families to keep looking down on those cultists.\"\n\"!?\"\nEven the loyal Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord couldn't hide his expression at such a reason.\n\"Won’t that be dangerous?\"\n\"It will be dangerous. But don't men have to take risks to achieve their goals?\"\nAfter uttering these cryptic words, the Chief Strategist’s expression had already turned grave.\n\"Think about how the martial world operates these days. The Murim Alliance's name is famous, but it holds no meaning. Am I wrong to say that everything is actually decided by the old fogeys from the Nine Sects and One Gang and the Seven Great Families?\"\n\"...\"\n“What do you think? Are those people really righteous? Are they just?”\n\"...\"\nAt Gongsun Hyeon's pointed questions, the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord couldn't give any answer.\nSure, there were a few good apples in the barrel. A few sects and a few people who genuinely tried to be heroes and do the right thing.\nBut looking at the whole picture, they were just a small minority.\n\"Am I wrong to say that they just strut around trampling and making a mockery of martial world justice, simply because they happened to join good sects when they were young or were born into prestigious families?\"\n\"...\"\nFlying Dragon Pavilion Lord remembered what had happened earlier.\nDespite reaching the position of Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord of the Murim Alliance and wielding power that ranked in the top five within the alliance, he had to endure criticism from elders—not even sect leaders—of the Nine Sects and One Gang and Seven Great Families during today's meeting.\nAnd the same was true for Gongsun Hyeon.\nThe only reason a man like him, a nobody from a minor sect, had managed to climb so high was because all the big powers were too busy fighting each other to let any one of their own take the top spot.\nDespite holding the title of Chief Strategist, his power was only half of what it should be.\nIn reality, the Zhuge Family ran around acting like they were the real brains of the Alliance.\nIn reality, the Zhuge Family ran around acting like they were the real brains of the Alliance.\nGongsun Hyeon knew exactly how frustrated the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord felt because he felt the exact same way. And that’s why he willingly revealed his inner thoughts to him.\nBut then again, Gongson Hyeon was smart enough to become the Chief Strategist without having a powerful family to back him up.\nHe also knew how foolish it was to 'trust' someone.\nHe simply knew how to make others move according to his will.\n\"Shall we cast out those hypocrites and properly establish justice in the martial world under the banner of the Murim Alliance?\"\nJust like now, wrapping the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord's resentment in the name of justice to draw him in.\n\"So you're planning to let those Demonic Cult bastards invade the Central Plains? By making the Nine Sects and One Gang and Seven Great Families drop their guard?\"\n“Exactly. Think about it. Why was the Murim Alliance even created in the first place? To fight the Demonic Cult. When you’re facing a big enough threat that everyone has to team up to survive, power naturally flows to the top. Right to us, the Murim Alliance.”\nHe had already hatched the plan by making all those elders in the meeting drop their guard. But he was a sharp man, and he knew a plan this big would take a lot of effort and manpower to pull off.\n“Which is why I have a secret mission for you. I want you to take your most trusted guys—the ones who know how to keep their mouths shut—and find out everything you can about the Eighth Young Master.”\n\"The Eighth Young Master?\"\nWhy him? Why the kid from the crazy stories?\nGongsun Hyeon smiled coldly.\n\"They say there's no smoke without fire. The rumors themselves might be exaggerated, but there must be a reason for them to have spread. Above all, if he is a disciple cherished by that fearsome Heavenly Demon, there must be a reason, right?\"\nWhat Gongsun Hyeon wanted was simply to use the Demonic Cult's invasion as an opportunity to overturn the Central Plains' power structure.\nHe had absolutely no intention of handing the Central Plains over to the Demonic Cult.\n“As you command! I’ll find out everything about the Eighth Young Master, right down to how many hairs are on his head!”\nMoved by Gongsun Hyeon's words, the Flying Dragon Pavilion Lord saluted with his eyes blazing with newfound purpose.

The battlefield was dead silent, probably because everyone who wasn't on their side was dead.\nGULP.\nThe sound of Il-mok swallowing after hearing about Dam Bin's side effects echoed unusually loud.\nLooking somewhat tense, Il-mok asked, “So, uh, that side effect… you doing okay with it?”\nDam Bin still wore her bewitching smile as she answered:\n\"Since I've transcended the Extremity stage, it's been bearable enough for several years now.\"\n\"I, I see.\"\nRight after Il-mok answered with a somewhat awkward voice, an uncomfortable silence hung between the two for just a moment.\n\"Big brother!\"\nHyeokryeon Seon-ah's voice shattered that silence.\nMoving swiftly toward Il-mok, she looked up at him with watery eyes. \"Are you alright, big brother?\"\nThanks to Seon-ah's appearance, Il-mok escaped the awkward atmosphere and answered with a worried expression.\n\"I'm fine. But what about you, Seon-ah? How did you end up covered in blood like this?\"\nHe was pointing at the splatters all over her face and clothes.\n\"Thanks to big brother's concern, I'm perfectly safe!\"\nSeon-ah said this with a face that seemed to beg for praise.\nIl-mok reached out to stroke Hyeokryeon Seon-ah's red hair, then hesitated.\n—Are your eyes just for decoration?! There's blood all over her!\nHis hygiene obsession was too strong to touch someone covered in blood, even if that person was his adorable younger sister.\nWhen Il-mok's approaching hand stopped, Hyeokryeon Seon-ah looked at his hand with the most regretful expression in the world.\nIf those who had died with their hearts and throats pierced by her fingernails had seen that expression, they would have died all over again from shock.\nFinally giving up on patting Seol-ah's head, Il-mok said awkwardly, \"You worked hard. Miss Jin and Young Master Baek worked hard too.\"\nIt turned out Seol-ah had just sprinted ahead of her team. Jin Hayeon and Baek Cheon had now caught up and entered the leader's chamber.\n\"I'm fine. You've also worked hard, Young Master, \" Jin Hayeon replied dispassionately.\n“Hahaha! That was nothing! A walk in the park, Eighth Young Master!\" Followed the boisterous Baekcheon.\n\"Young Master!\"\n“No way!”\nJu Seo-yeon and Ouyang Mun looked at Il-mok with faces as if the sky were falling.\nAnd in a way, it had. The fight was already over, so their genius plan to get hurt saving Il-mok so Jin Hayeon would have to cradle them in her loving arms was officially up in smoke.\n‘Damnit. If only it hadn’t been for those men at the last moment!’\n'If I'd known, I would've just taken a sword to the gut to end it faster!'\nBoth of them were thinking the exact same thing.\nOn their way to the Society Leader's chamber, the remaining two Peak Realm masters of the Heavenly Orchid Society had blocked their path.\nBut with Jeong Hyeon playing sniper support, there was no way two Peak masters could stop them. So they’d killed them and rushed over, but it was too late.\nWhile the two weirdos were moping, Il-mok turned to the girl trying to make herself invisible in the corner.\n\"Miss Jeong also worked hard.\"\n\"I, I just did wh-what I had to do.\"\nIl-mok had no intention of telling Ouyang Mun and Ju Seo-yeon that they worked hard.\n'They were probably hoping I'd get in trouble. Fucking bastards.'\nHe could practically read what these two sasaeng fans were thinking just from one look at their eyes.\nOnce everyone was accounted for, Il-mok got down to business.\n“Did you clean up all the Heavenly Orchid Society scums you ran into?\"\n\"Yes, Young Master.\"\n“Good. Gather the bodies. We’re burning them to get rid of the evidence.”\nThe evidence Il-mok was talking about was the wounds on the corpses.\nThe wounds were basically a signature of their Demonic Arts. If they left them be, someone might figure out who they were.\nHe doubted the Murim Alliance bastards would bother investigating the details of some backwater Gansu Province.\n'Better safe than sorry.'\nFor Il-mok, who had to live with the paranoid voice of his own Demonic Art, destroying the evidence was just second nature.",

    "content": "Chapter 195: Night of Lanzhou (1)\nAs soon as Il-mok gave his orders, the group quickly got moving.\nWell, everyone except Il-mok.\n\"Ahem. I have severe hygiene obsessions, so I'm afraid I can't help with this particular task. Carrying corpses around or rummaging through grimy corners is out of the question for me. What if I accidentally trigger my obsessive-compulsive disorder and go berserk? That would be quite problematic, wouldn't it?\"\nIl-mok felt awkward being the only one sitting this one out, so he rattled off excuse after excuse.\n“It is fine for you to entrust such miscellaneous chores to us.”\n\"As your subordinates, this is naturally our duty.\"\n\"Don't worry about it, big brother.\"\nDam Bin, Jin Hayeon, and Hyeokryeon Seon-ah all responded without missing a beat, and the others didn't seem to mind either as they filed out of the hall.\nWatching them voluntarily take on the grunt work, Il-mok let out a sigh of relief.\nHalf of what he'd said was just an excuse, but the other half was genuine.\n'Damn sweat.'\nThe perspiration from his fight with the Heavenly Orchid Society's leader was making his obsessive-compulsive tendencies gradually worse as time went on.\n\"Phew.\"\nWhile Il-mok tried to calm himself and ease his compulsions by cooling down his sweat, his companions busied themselves with their work.\nThey scoured the massive estate of the Heavenly Orchid Society, gathering up the corpses they'd created and searching every nook and cranny for valuables and ledgers along the way.\nResting in the leader's hall, Il-mok had this thought.\n'Man, I really made the right call coming to the Central Plains!'\nThis kind of situation would've been impossible back at headquarters.\nHe'd probably be stuck under his Master or his Eldest Brother's thumb, getting worked to death, acting as a Wikipedia every single day.\nIl-mok was enjoying this brief moment of happiness during his break when—\n\"Young Master, what do you plan to do with these people?\"\nJin Hayeon pointed indifferently toward one corner while piling corpses,\nThere lay three unconscious women.\nThey were the women who'd been in bed with the Heavenly Orchid Society leader when they first attacked this place.\nThey’d all passed out from shock when Il-mok started butchering the bodyguards.\n\"Hmm.\"\nIl-mok thought about it for a second, then shrugged.\n“Let’s just take them to the local branch for now.”\nAfter they finished piling up the bodies, setting them on fire, and stuffing their bags with all the loot and ledgers they could find, Il-mok and his crew headed for the cult's Lanzhou branch office.\nSince Lanzhou was also a provincial capital, it was, of course, home to a branch office of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nThe cult had about six or seven branches in every Central Plains province they operated in, with around a dozen people at each one.\nHowever, areas near provincial capitals and major sect locations had slightly more branch members assigned to them, though not every city had a branch.\nThey had a presence in the provinces closer to their home base in Xinjiang—like Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, and Yunnan—and their network stretched all the way out to Hunan and Hubei near Dongting Lake where the Murim Alliance was located.\nOn the flip side, they had zero presence in the eastern provinces like Zhejiang or Hebei.\nIt was a nightmare to manage a branch from that far away, and by the time any intel got back to main headquarters, it would be outdated.\nAnyway, thanks to the info they got from Gulang’s Branch Leader, Il-mok and his team found the place with no problem.\n\"We greet the Eighth Disciple of the Supreme One!\"\nEven though it was still only the early morning hours of the Hour of Rabbit (5-7 AM), the Lanzhou Branch Leader was already outside with a welcoming party.\nAbout half of the Lanzhou branch members lived at this estate as servants or family members, while the other half lived elsewhere and visited periodically to maintain their cover.\nThe Lanzhou Branch Leader bowed his head and clasped his hands as he asked, “Young Master. By any chance, did you run into some trouble on the way?”\nWhile Il-mok himself had less blood on his clothes, quite a few others were splattered with it, and some were even carrying unconscious women on their backs, hence his question.\nBut the answer he got was beyond the Branch Leader's expectations.\n\"We fought the Heavenly Orchid Society.\"\n\"!?\"\n“From this day forth, the scums in Lanzhou who call themselves its sky will no longer exist.”\n\"You... you completely destroyed the Heavenly Orchid Society?\"\nWhen Il-mok nodded, the Branch Leader prostrated himself with a shocked expression.\n\"The Supreme One’s grace has shone upon Lanzhou, bringing salvation to all living beings.\"\nBecause he operated in Gansu rather than Xinjiang, the news was slow to reach him; however, he too had heard the rumors about the Eighth Young Master.\nBut he never would’ve dreamed they could take out the entire Heavenly Orchid Society with just that small number of martial artists.\nThe branch members, realizing that the disciple they served was a genius far beyond common sense, also prostrated themselves before Il-mok following their leader.\nIn that reverent atmosphere, the genius far beyond common sense opened his mouth.\n\"First, could you prepare some bath water for me?\"\nIt had been over two hours since his life-and-death battle with the Heavenly Orchid Society Leader.\nHis tolerance for hygiene had already reached its limit.\n—Kill them all!\n—Purge this world of its filthy dust and filth! Slice it all away!\nThose prostrating before Il-mok had no idea.\nThey had absolutely no clue that the man they were worshipping was a lunatic who was about one step away from completely snapping.\nAfter finishing his ritual bath and cleansing.\n\"Lanzhou Branch Leader Gye Yun reporting. May I enter, Young Master?\"\n\"Come in.\"\nThe Lanzhou Branch Leader entered the hall with Il-mok's guards.\n“We questioned the women and found that all three women were sold here from other counties due to debts.\"\n\"Are you certain?\"\nIf it turned out to be false, like they might be the Society Leader’s concubines for instance, things could get complicated.\nIn response to Il-mok's question, the Branch Leader replied.\n\"We have records of the transactions involving these women. Of course, we'd need to verify with their home counties to be completely certain, but it is highly likely to be true for now.\"\n“If we have a branch in their hometowns, tell them to confirm it. If not, send someone over to check.”\n\"I will obey your command.\"\n\"And guide me to where those women are being held. I need to have a little chat with them.\"\nAt Il-mok's words, the Branch Leader led him there.\nHe was glad to see the women showed no signs of torture from their interrogation.\nHowever, because they could not comprehend the current situation, every one of them had eyes filled with anxiety.\n“Do not be alarmed. If what you've told us is true and you have no direct connection to the Heavenly Orchid Society, we'll release you in a few days.\"\nAlthough Il-mok spoke in a placating manner, their eyes remained anxious.\nWatching them for a moment, Il-mok brought up something more hopeful to lighten the mood.\n\"If what you've said is true, I'll gladly send you back to your hometowns. The Heavenly Orchid Society is gone now, so you won't need to worry about those debts anymore.\"\nBut for some reason, the news that they could go home didn’t make them happy.\nTheir expressions remained gloomy.\nHe thought maybe they didn't trust his words or were just anxious, but thanks to a telepathic message from Dam Bin nearby, Il-mok realized the truth.\n—Young Master, sending those women back to their hometowns might actually be a terrible thing for them.\n—What do you mean by that?\n—Because the people in their villages know they were sold as prostitutes.\nOnly then did Il-mok recall something he'd learned long ago.\nWhile studying Korean history for civil service exams, he'd learned about the concept known as \"tribute women.\" He recalled the passage which stated that on the rare occasions that women sent as tribute to the Yuan dynasty returned to their hometowns, they were not welcomed by the village, and that such women were called by the slur ‘ hwanyangnyeon .’\n(TL Note: Just search 화냥년 on Google and you’ll know.)\nAfter pondering for a moment how to handle this, a good idea occurred to Il-mok, and he opened his mouth to speak.\n“So… any of you know how to act?”\nThe three women are beautiful enough to attract the Society Leader and keep them to himself. If they went into missionary work, they'd probably boast quite a success rate.\n\"A-acting?\" For origınal chapters go to novel-fire.net\nAll three of them looked stunned. Il-mok quickly clarified.\n“Oh, don’t worry about the basics. We’ll cover your food and housing.”\nHe had no intention of working them like slaves, at least.\nThe three women exchanged a long, complicated look. Finally, the one in the center took a deep breath and spoke.\n“We’ve never acted a day in our lives, but we'll do our best.\"\nThey had nowhere to go anyway, and they'd realized their lives were in this man's hands.\nHearing her determined answer, Il-mok turned to Baek Cheon.\n\"Young Master Baek. You’re up. Teach these ladies how to act.”\nThe second he heard the word \"act,\" Baek Cheon had started looking like a little kid unwrapping his gift during Christmas.\n“Say no more, Young Master! Though this Baek's acting skills overflow abundantly, handling all the roles in a grand play by myself was proving quite difficult. This Baek will train these women into the finest actresses and spread the name of the Heavenl—I mean, Maitreya far and wide!\"\nWatching Baek Cheon's ecstatic reaction, Il-mok smiled awkwardly.\n'I was just gonna use them as honey trap agents.'\nHe hadn't really planned to throw them into Baek Cheon's plays, but Baek Cheon looked so happy.\nThere’s an old saying that the only thing worse than not getting a gift is getting one and then having it snatched away. It was too late to take it back now.\n'Well... it's better than going back to their hometowns.'\nIl-mok felt a bit sorry for the three women who would now suffer under Baek Cheon, but decided to let it slide for now.\n\"Branch Leader.\"\n\"Yes, Young Master.\"\nWith the women's matter now concluded, Il-mok turned back to the Branch Leader.\n“While you were going through their ledgers, did you happen to find a list of the brothels, inns, and taverns the society was running in the city?”\nThinking about the three women had made him think about the bigger picture.\n'The intel said their whole operation was based on human trafficking across the entire province.'\nThere had to be more victims out there than just these three.\n“We have identified a certain portion, but as we have not yet confirmed all of the ledgers, additional investigations will be needed.\"\nIl-mok nodded at the Branch Leader's words.\n\"Let me know when you finish the investigations. With the Heavenly Orchid Society gone, Lanzhou's night scene will soon become a no-man's land, so it'll need organizing.\"\nAs Il-mok roughly sorted out the situation and was considering getting some sleep.\nThe Branch Leader cautiously spoke, \"Young Master, there's one more thing I need to report.\"\nWhen Il-mok looked at the Branch Leader with curiosity, he pulled out a small box from his robes and opened it.\nInside the box was some kind of plant.\nA medicinal herb radiating mystical energy.\n\"This was among the Heavenly Orchid Society's assets that you acquired, Young Master. I was hesitant to present it to you recklessly without knowing its precise identity, but after searching their ledgers, we were able to confirm that it is a thousand-year-old tuber fleeceflower root that they purchased on the black market.”\nHearing that, the corners of Il-mok's mouth curved upward.",

    "content": "Chapter 196: Night of Lanzhou (2)\nIl-mok was meditating in a room the Branch Leader had set up for him. He sat cross-legged, staring down at the thousand-year-old tuber fleece root in front of him.\n'I was disappointed about not having any breakthrough even after that life-or-death fight, but who knew I'd score an elixir here?'\nHe figured the Heavenly Orchid Society Leader probably bought it for himself. The guy was so damn lazy that despite being a martial artist, he was packed with fat rolls.\nBut Il-mok had to admit that his internal energy reserve was insane.\n'Guess when you don't feel like training but have money from bleeding Lanzhou dry, you just take the easy route with drugs.'\nOr maybe it was the other way around. Maybe he started munching on all these elixers and just got lazier and lazier.\n\"Lucky bastard...\"\nHe could picture the Heavenly Orchid Society Leader kicking back and doing nothing for a decade, and it made him shudder with jealousy.\nBut in the end, that very laziness and cruelty meant the elixir ended up in Il-mok's hands instead. Talk about a blessing in disguise.\n'This is also thanks to the Heavenly Demon's grace... wait, what the hell am I thinking?'\nIl-mok caught himself slipping into cult-worshipper and quickly shook his head.\n'That was close.'\nLeading a missionary work meant you could accidentally brainwash yourself if you weren't careful.\n\"Whew.\"\nAfter taking deep breaths to calm himself, Il-mok closed his eyes and expanded his qi perception.\nHe could feel four people stationed at each cardinal direction around the pavilion, acting as guardians.\nThey were there to keep outsiders away, but also to stop Il-mok if he went berserk.\nOnce he finished checking his surroundings, Il-mok shoved the thousand-year-old tuber fleece root into his mouth and swallowed it whole after chewing it a few times.\nThanks to the energy infused in the root, he could actually feel it traveling down his esophagus toward his stomach.\n\"Inhale. Exhale.\"\nIl-mok took a deep breath and circulated his qi from his dantian.\nThe demonic energy flowing from his dantian guided the pure qi from the thousand-year-old elixir through his meridians. As it circulated, the root's energy naturally transformed and took on the same demonic attribute as his Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\nEven as the first wave of absorbed energy cycled through his meridians, new energy kept flowing from the root, and Il-mok's own energy went out to guide it in turn.\nAnd once all the roots' energy had been dyed with demonic qi, Il-mok felt a slight tension building and focused even harder.\n\"Inhale. Exhale.\"\n'Okay, here comes the hard part.'\nAbsorbing elixir wasn't always safe.\nJust like how doping in the modern world could send you straight to the afterlife or leave you with serious side effects, elixirs were the same.\nIl-mok began guiding the energy racing through his meridians back into his dantian.\nBut even though he hadn't absorbed all the energy still circulating through his meridians, his dantian had filled up completely at some point.\nThe energy absorbed from the root had increased beyond what his current dantian could hold.\n\"Inhale. Exhale.\"\nSo Il-mok carefully divided it strand by strand, cramming the excess energy into his dantian like stuffing luggage into a tiny gap.\nAs his dantian started to ache from the strain of being stretched to its absolute limit, it slowly began to get bigger.\nYou often hear people in the martial world talking about how much internal energy they have, throwing around terms like \"half a cycle\" or \"a full sixty-year cycle\" of energy.\nBut that was actually a misleading way to put it.\nIf a martial artist who'd trained for decades and accumulated half a cycle of internal energy used it all up in a life-or-death battle, would they really need to train for the same number of years to rebuild that half jiazi?\nOf course not.\nNormally, it only takes a couple of hours, maybe a day, to get your internal energy fully recovered after a fight.\nIn other words, when people talked about half a cycle or a full sixty-year cycle, they weren't referring to the amount of internal energy in the dantian—they were talking about the dantian's size and the maximum amount of internal energy a dantian could hold.\nThat was not to say that having a large dantian meant it took a long time to recover one’s internal energy.\nActually, the bigger it is, the faster it refills. A bigger dantian has a higher absorption rate when it’s empty, and the meridians trained during the expansion process could handle much larger amounts of internal energy.\nRight now, Il-mok was using the medicine's energy to expand his dantian's size.\nAnd sweating buckets while he did it.\n'Fucking Demonic Art.'\nThis was one of the few downsides to these cheat-like Demonic Arts.\nUnlike the pure and docile cultivation methods of Buddhist or Daoist schools, demonic energy was an absolute pain in the ass.\nIt was a pain in the ass in normal condition and it’s an even more pain in the ass when he is actively training his dantian. Moreover, if the demonic energy succeeds in its tantrum, it would throw him into a Qi Deviation right off the bat,\nIt’s not a big deal when you’re a beginner and you don’t have much demonic energy or a big dantian. But once you hit a certain level, trying to get stronger is like walking on eggshells.\nThis was also closely related to why Demonic Arts often stalled after reaching a certain level.\nThey're already dealing with all the crazy side effects, and trying this on top of it all is a surefire way to go completely nuts.\n'I can't end up like I did at the Demonic Way Hall.'\nIf Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi hadn't basically babysat him through every single training session, Il-mok would have either died or gone nuts years ago.\nAnd thanks to that experience, Il-mok was now quite accustomed to the task of managing his demonic energy while expanding his dantian.\nIl-mok guided the energy flowing like a river through his meridians toward his dantian.\nHis dantian was already full, so he had to expand it carefully bit by bit. Trying to forcefully cram in large amounts of internal energy would send him straight into Qi Deviation.\nBut the energy heading toward his dantian didn't actually enter it. Instead, it began wrapping around the outside.\nThen he took a tiny little thread of demonic energy and forced it inside the packed core, making it spasm violently. The instant it did, he used the energy blanket outside the dantian to absorb the shock.\nIt was a trick he’d been forced to invent near the end of his time at the Hall of the Demonic Way when he got so unstable that he’d nearly go into Qi deviation just from trying to meditate.\nHe got the idea from his old life as Seo Ji-hoon, remembering how he used to pack fragile stuff in bubble wrap.\nHe didn’t know how long he maintained that focus.\n\"Exhale.\"\nIl-mok, who'd been so absorbed in his cultivation that he'd lost track of time, finally opened his eyes with a deep breath.\nIntense light briefly flashed from Il-mok's eyes, but once his energy settled, they returned to their usual indifferent gaze.\n\"About twenty years' worth of cultivation, I'd say.\"\nThat was the result of absorbing every last bit of the root's energy without wasting a drop.\nFor context, by the time he graduated from the Hall of the Demonic Way, he'd managed to build up a power level of just over a sixty-year cycle after cramming nothing but training for several months straight.\nAnd today, after cramming in an additional twenty years' worth of cultivation, his dantian had grown to about one and a half cycles.\nFor a guy who’d only started training three years ago, that was just insane.\nPart of it was because Demonic Arts naturally progressed faster, but without the Explosive Demon Pill and the thousand-year-old tuber fleece roots, this achievement would've been impossible.\nMost of the Explosive Demon Pill's energy had been used for body refinement with minimal absorption, but his meridians had expanded and cleared during that process and could dramatically increase the amount of internal energy absorbed with each cultivation session. Over the past two years, he'd accumulated far more energy than what had been spent on body refinement.\nBut for a guy who’d just gotten a massive power-up, Il-mok's expression wasn't particularly bright.\n\"Tsk. Can't be helped, I guess.\"\nSadly, he hadn't broken through to a new realm or gained any enlightenment this time either.\nStill, thanks to the increased internal energy, the burden of wielding Sword Force had lessened considerably.\nAs Il-mok confirmed his progress and left the pavilion, those who'd been standing guard welcomed him.\n\"Congratulations, Young Master.\"\n\"We congratulate you on your achievement.\"\nIl-mok nodded and asked, \"Thanks for standing guard. By the way, how many hours passed while I was meditating?\"\n\"About eight hours, Young Master.\"\nIl-mok almost laughed out loud when he heard that.\n'If twenty years' worth of internal energy cultivation took this long, eating something like Azure Stone Milk or Ten-Thousand-Year Snow Ginseng would either keep me up all night or kill me with Qi Deviation.'\nThere was a reason for the saying \"too much is as bad as too little.\" Especially for Demonic Arts practitioners.\n\"Also, we received word from the Branch Leader. They've compiled a complete list of all the brothels and taverns managed by the Heavenly Orchid Society.\"\n\"Since you've exhausted yourself absorbing the medicine, Young Master, we'll handle visiting those establishments.\"\nAt Jin Hayeon and Dam Bin's words, Il-mok's lips nearly curved upward.\n'Ha. Coming to the Central Plains was definitely the right call.'\nSubordinates who volunteered to handle work? How wonderful was that?\nBut, because he had at least a shred of decency, he made an offer he hoped they’d refuse.\n\"You must be tired from standing guard. Why don't you rest a bit before heading out?\"\n\"We took turns resting while on guard duty, so there's no need to worry.\"\nThis time, Il-mok couldn’t stop himself. A huge grin spread across his face.\nMeanwhile, the mood in Lanzhou's red-light district was tense.\nRumors about the bloodbath that occurred at the massive estate not far from the district had spread.\nWith the Heavenly Orchid Society fallen, the atmosphere grew chaotic.\nBut the specific mood varied subtly from brothel to brothel.\nSome trembled in fear and watched nervously, while others saw the Heavenly Orchid Society's fall as an opportunity to strike out on their own.\nIn the depths of one establishment, the Crimson Silk Pavilion, its owner sat with a furrowed brow.\n\"Pavilion Master, now is our chance.\"\nAt the words of his confidant, the one in charge of the Crimson Silk Pavilion's security, the Pavilion Master shook his head.\n\"We don't know the identity of those who attacked the Heavenly Orchid Society, nor do we know their purpose. Moving recklessly now would be dangerous.\"\n\"The Great Clarity Pavilion has already started making moves. If we just sit here waiting, we might end up paying tribute to them instead.\"\n\"And what if those who attacked the Heavenly Orchid Society come looking for us?\"\n“It’s been half a day and nothing’s happened! I'm certain some righteous master passing through got angry at their evil deeds and killed them before moving on.\"\n“I get why you’re antsy. But the world doesn’t usually give you such neat and tidy happy endings.”\n\"That caution of yours is quite admirable.\"\nA woman’s voice cut into their conversation, making both the Pavilion Master and his confidant’s heads snap around.\nFrom the corner of the room, a pool of darkness coalesced into the form of a woman wearing black clothes with a wrathful deity mask perched on her face.\nClang!\nThe confidant quickly drew his blade, but the Pavilion Master extended his arm to stop him.\nAfter restraining his confidant, the Pavilion Master cupped his fists and bowed to the uninvited guest.\n\"This humble one greets the new sky of Lanzhou.\"\n\"!!!\"\nAs the confidant's expression filled with shock, a smile formed on the lips visible through the woman's mask.\nIt was a weirdly magnetic smile. Even though only her eyes and mouth were visible, an inexplicable sensuality emanated from her.\n\"Not only cautious, but exceptionally perceptive as well.\"\nThe woman—Dam Bin—spoke approvingly, then issued her command.\n\"Gather all the women working at this Crimson Silk Pavilion.\"\nThe Pavilion Master could have asked why, but instead immediately sent a glance to his confidant without hesitation.\nShortly after, the confidant returned, leading the courtesans working there.\nOnce enough people had gathered, Dam Bin spoke.\n\"From today forward, this Crimson Silk Pavilion will operate under the protection of our Maitreya Luminous Cult, and you will pay five percent of your profit as a protection fee.\"\nThe confidant nearly shouted, 'That's an outrageous rate!' but stopped himself. Orıginal content can be found at NovєlFіre.net\n'Wait. Five percent? Not fifty?'\nCompared to what they'd been paying the Heavenly Orchid Society, this was practically nothing.\nBut Dam Bin wasn't finished yet.\n\"However, from now on, the courtesans must be paid fairly for their labor. Anyone who forcibly prevents a courtesan from switching to being an entertainer only, or from quitting entirely, will face divine punishment.\"\nAt her unexpected words, the eyes of the courtesans who'd been dragged here and trembling with fear widened.\nOne courtesan mustered her courage and asked Dam Bin, \"W-what about our debts?\"\nDam Bin smiled and answered.\n\"Don't worry. The Heavenly Orchid Society has been erased from this world, and your debts went with the Society Leader to the afterlife.\"\nThere was a strange pride in her tone.\nPride in the man who’d come up with this plan, the Eighth Young Master.\n'The way he cherishes the common people... he truly embodies the cult's ideals.'\nIn truth, Il-mok had initially considered shutting down all the brothels and freeing all the courtesans. But after hearing the stories of the three women in the Heavenly Orchid Society, he'd changed his mind a bit.\nHe realized that in a world like this, sending these women home would just be sending them from one hell to another.\nSo the next best option was to eliminate their debts and give them choices.\nAnd Il-mok's instructions didn't end with the courtesans.\n\"Furthermore, the Crimson Silk Pavilion Master's money that was forcibly used by the Heavenly Orchid Society to purchase courtesans will also be returned. So don't feel wronged.\"\nWhen the masked woman brought up the very issue the Pavilion Master had been too afraid to mention, he internally breathed a sigh of relief.\n\"I can only express my gratitude for the new sky's mercy.\"\nAs the Pavilion Master expressed his thanks with another show of respect, Dam Bin nodded and said, \"As I mentioned, this place will now operate under the Maitreya Luminous Cult's protection, so you must follow the cult's teachings from now on. There will be gatherings later; be sure to attend.\"\n\"I will obey your command.\"\n\"Also, Pavilion Master, in addition to this place, I'm entrusting you with management of the Great Clarity Pavilion as well.\"\n\"I'm terribly sorry to say this, but the master of that place won't listen to someone like me.\"\n\"You needn't worry about that. Divine punishment from Maitreya has already befallen him.\"\nA smile bloomed on the lips visible through the masked woman's face. A smile reeking of blood.\nCold sweat trickled down the Pavilion Master's forehead at that thick scent of blood, and he quickly bowed his head.\nWhen he raised his head again, the masked woman was nowhere to be seen.\nBut the lingering, fishy scent of blood still remained.\n'Tonight, another storm of blood will sweep through this area.'\nThe Pavilion Master, who was usually told he was too cautious, realized that very caution had saved his life.",

    "content": "Chapter 197: Proselytization (1)\nEarly the next morning.\n\"Haaaaaah.\"\nIl-mok stretched lazily as he woke up.\nAfter fighting the Heavenly Orchid Society Leader and spending from early morning till afternoon absorbing the energy of the thousand-year-old elixir through meditation, he'd crashed in the early evening and was only now waking up.\n\"Are you awake, Young Master?\"\nHearing Dam Bin's voice from outside the door, Il-mok yawned as he stepped out and asked.\n\"Haaaah. How'd things go last night?\"\n\"I delivered all your instructions. Anyone who dared to resist your will or who acted out of greedy has been dealt with.\"\n\"Good work. You couldn't have slept much at all. Why don't you get some rest?\"\n\"We're taking turns sleeping, so there's no need to worry.\"\nIl-mok looked past Dam Bin and noticed Ju Seo-yeon pouting.\nThey were taking guard duty in pairs, and she clearly wasn't thrilled about constantly being paired with either Dam Bin or Ouyang Mun.\nIt was Il-mok's consideration for Jin Hayeon. If he'd paired her with Ju Seo-yeon or Ouyang Mun for guard duty, who knows what horrific things might've happened.\nBut her sullen face didn't last long. Ju Seo-yeon's eyes suddenly sparkled.\nJin Hayeon and Hyeokryeon Seon-ah were approaching with each carrying a tray and a basin.\n\"Big brother!\"\n“We brought your breakfast and some water to wash up.”\nAs Hyeokryeon Seon-ah greeted Il-mok with a bright smile and Jin Hayeon's calm voice chimed in, Ju Seo-yeon exclaimed with the face of a puppy meeting its owner after hours apart.\n\"You're beautiful as ever today, Senior Hayeon!\"\n“…Thank you.”\nAfter replying brusquely to Ju Seo-yeon’s adoration, Jin Hayeon turned to Dam Bin.\n“Section Leader. We shall take over the guard duty from now on. Please have some rest.\"\n“Will do.”\nDam Bin nodded and grabbed the puppy-eyed Ju Seo-yeon by the scruff of her neck and dragged her away.\n\"......\"\nIl-mok just shook his head at the dizzying scene. He washed his face to shake off the compulsion and enjoyed his breakfast.\nAfter finishing his meal, Il-mok asked. \"Where are Young Master Baek Cheon and the women?\" Updates are released by NoveIꜰire.net\n\"I'll summon them right away.\"\nJin Hayeon left the hall and returned shortly after with Baek Cheon and the three women.\n\"......\"\nIl-mok stared at them speechlessly for a moment, then sighed and asked Baek Cheon.\n\"What the hell did you do to them?\"\nThe three women looked absolutely wrecked. They were completely out of it, looking even more traumatized than when they’d been interrogated last night.\n\"I merely taught them acting.\"\n\"...What kind of teaching leaves them looking like jiangshis?\"\nBaek Cheon looked wronged, and it was Jin Hayeon who explained instead.\n\"Apparently, he's been teaching them acting since you gave the order.\"\n\"Don't tell me... all night?\"\nBaek Cheon protested.\n“I am being wronged! Do you really think I would make them stay up all night? Sleep deprivation is the enemy of beauty! How could someone like me, who needs to catch everyone's attention, stay up all night?\"\n\"......\"\nIl-mok just stared at him like he’d lost his mind as he continued to yap.\n\"I just taught them acting until the end of the Hour of Pig (9-11 PM), then started practice again this morning.\"\nIn other words, after being ordered to teach them acting yesterday at dawn, he'd worked them for eight full hours, and that still wasn't enough for him, so he'd woken them up again this morning to continue.\nIl-mok took a moment to blame himself.\n'There's no 'moderation' in lunatics’ dictionary. I knew he was nuts. This is on me for not giving him a time limit beforehand.'\nIl-mok let out a soft sigh. \"Well, if you pushed them that hard, they must have at least gotten the basics down.\"\n\"They're good enough for the task at hand.\"\nIl-mok nodded. “Then there’s no reason to wait. Get started.”\nOnly then did the three women realize. The mastermind behind their suffering at the hands of this insane attention-whore was this very man.\nThat's when the crazy attention-whore suddenly blurted out something unexpected.\n\"Young Master. Along with these three, could you also send Miss Jeong with them?\"\n\"You mean Jeong Hyeon?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nIl-mok frowned. \"Why?\"\n“She’ll be their role model.”\n“You think she can handle that?”\nIl-mok asked, recalling Jeong Hyeon's side effects.\n\"Young Master! That's disrespectful to her!\"\nBaek Cheon's eyes sparkled with trust in Jeong Hyeon.\n\"She studied acting under me for over six months. I believe she can definitely pull it off!\"\nActually, no. He just believed in his own teaching.\nMadman's ravings aside, Il-mok fell into thought for a moment.\nThere was actually something that had been bothering him. And if Jeong Hyeon joined the proselytizing, it might solve that problem.\nAfter finishing his deliberation, Il-mok spoke.\n\"Bring Miss Jeong here. I'll let her decide for herself.\"\nA minute later…\nJeong Hyeon, who had just woken up, arrived at Il-mok's hall with a half-asleep face.\nLast night, Dam Bin and the other women from the Hidden Guard Pavilion, along with Ouyang Mun, had visited the brothels and taverns managed by the Heavenly Orchid Society.\nOn top of that, they'd taken turns standing guard for Il-mok, so she'd only fallen asleep at dawn before waking up.\n\"I-I greet Young Master Il-mok.\"\nAs Jeong Hyeon bowed in greeting, Il-mok smiled gently and explained the general situation.\nShe was already half-asleep, so hearing this crazy talk about a recruitment mission made her brain just short-circuit. She stared blankly at Baek Cheon.\n'Wh-what did I ever do to deserve this from him?'\nBaek Cheon, completely misreading Jeong Hyeon's resentful look, flashed his white teeth in a smile.\nHis eyes screamed, 'Just trust me! With the acting skills you learned from me, you'll be more than fine!'\nJudging by their gazes alone, they weren't on the same wavelength at all.\nNot that talking ever helped. Baek Cheon only heard what he wanted to hear after all.\nThat's when Il-mok's voice pulled Jeong Hyeon from her thoughts.\n\"I called you here to give you a choice, Miss Jeong. If you were someone who merely trembled in fear, I wouldn't have bothered, but didn't you say you wanted to overcome your social anxiety?\"\n\"Ah...\"\n\"I won't force you, so think it over carefully and decide.\"\nAfter mulling it over for a moment, Jeong Hyeon spoke.\n\"I-I do want to overcome my social anxiety, but pr-proselytizing requires t-talking to people, doesn't it?\"\nShe might be able to approach people if she really tried, but she had no confidence in holding a proper conversation.\nShe could already picture herself stuttering terribly or muttering in a voice like ants crawling before spiralling into a panic attack.\nBut for some reason, Il-mok just grinned.\n\"Don't worry. In your case, you won't need to speak at all.\"\nLater, at a teahouse in the middle of the Lanzhou market.\nCute tea sets and sweet snacks were products that young women loved regardless of time or place.\nThis place was famous among Lanzhou's young women, making it a spot that countless women frequented.\nNormally, the teahouse should have been filled with the chatter of young women, starting with praise for the tea's aroma and taste, and then exchanging various neighbourhood gossip.\nBut for some reason, there were strange silences between conversations today.\nThe reason was simple.\nMost of the women had their attention captured by something, making it impossible for them to properly converse with their companions.\nSome were just openly gawking, totally mesmerized. Others would try to look away, only to find their eyes drifting back for another peek.\nAnd at the place their gazes were directed, there was Jeong Hyeon.\n\"Oh my, oh my. Look at that face.\"\n\"Hey. Be careful. What if he hears you?\"\nDressed in men's clothing.\nThanks to her heightened senses from the Ghostly Spirit Divine Bow, Jeong Hyeon didn't miss the women's voices.\n'H-how did it come to this?'\nNaturally, it was Il-mok's doing.\nAfter deciding to use the three women for proselytizing, Il-mok had one concern.\n‘Although they cannot be compared to Miss Jin or Seon-ah, all three possess respectable looks, more than enough to conduct missionary work… but if we do this, the gender ratio will be completely unbalanced.’\nSince he was using honey traps for proselytizing, the new converts would be nothing but men at this rate.\nOf course, they'd be recruiting courtesans as converts while taking over brothels and taverns, but he couldn't help feeling something was missing.\nThis felt less like evangelizing and more like annexing territory.\nHe wondered for a second why he even cared about the gender balance, but then remembered his side effects. The imbalance in the gender ratio bothered him.\nAnd that’s when Baek Cheon suggested having Jeong Hyeon participate in the mission. For Il-mok, it was a eureka moment.\nHe remembered what happened at the Hall of the Demonic Way. Specifically, his first meeting with Jeong Hyeon.\n'That's right! She's got that androgynous look. With the right clothes and hairstyle, she could totally pass for a pretty boy!'\nIl-mok himself had mistaken her for a man for quite a while, hadn't he?\nMoreover, once his thinking shifted, other forgotten memories came flooding back.\nThe biggest share was from his time as Seo Ji-hoon.\nSpecifically, what he'd recalled when he discovered Ju Seo-yeon was Jin Hayeon's sasaeng fan. He remembered this girl in college who was a sasaeng fan of some pop idol, and a crazy rant she once went on.\n—Obviously, the muscular 'beast idols' are way better than the skinny flower boys! Sure, little kids who are still scared of real men might prefer the feminine-looking pretty boys and hate guys with six-pack abs, but they just don't know what's good!\nThat was from way back, when weird K-pop terms like \"beast idol\" were all the rage.\nAnd if you flipped that college student's words around:\n'Young women who've never been close to men or still find them intimidating prefer androgynous pretty boys!' was the shocking conclusion one could reach.\nThe mission Il-mok assigned to Jeong Hyeon was precisely this: the pretty boy strategy.\nIn other words, it could be called the Jade-Faced Young Master Bait.\nWhile Jeong Hyeon was having an internal crisis about being turned into a K-pop Idol by Il-mok, the voices of young women from respectable families reached her ears.\n\"Where did such a gorgeous man come from...?\"\nI’m not a man.\n\"Look how pale his face is. How can he be paler than me, a woman?\"\nIt’s called ‘being scared stiff.’\n\"And that bearing. Look at those melancholic eyes.\"\nI’m not melancholic. I’m about to burst into tears .",

    "content": "Chapter 198: Proselytization (2)\nAmong the young women of Lanzhou, there was one tea house that enjoyed unrivaled popularity.\nBut wherever flowers bloom, bees are bound to gather.\nAs women's gazes flocked to Jeong Hyeon, there were naturally quite a few who weren't too pleased about it.\n\"Tsk.\"\nOne such man sat there, his face flushed red with anger.\nHe'd heard that a woman he'd been pining after frequented this place, so he'd shown up pretending it was just a coincidence and miraculously managed to sit at her table. But even though he was right there with her, she kept sneaking glances at that pale, pretty-boy-looking bastard over there who resembled some rich madam’s plaything.\nUnable to contain his rage, the man stood up.\nAs he stormed toward the Jade-Faced Young Master, the woman who'd been sitting with him belatedly realized what was happening and jumped up to chase after him in alarm.\nBut before she could stop him, the man had already closed the distance to Jeong Hyeon.\n\"You look like a rich madam’s plaything. Came here to toy with women's hearts, did you?\"\nIn response to the man's provocation, the Jade-Faced Young Master remained seated and only glancing up at him with eyes that seemed lost in melancholy before turning away.\nFor Jeong Hyeon, meeting someone's eyes directly at such close range was simply too difficult to bear.\nBut the man took that attitude as a sign of contempt.\n“You son of a bitch!”\nHe was so furious that he just lost it and threw a punch.\nTo Jeong Hyeon, whose five senses had been heightened to an extreme degree thanks to the Ghostly Spirit Divine Bow, that punch seemed to crawl through the air like a caterpillar.\nNow, it was true that her side effects usually made her freeze up solid when people got this close, but she was still someone who'd graduated from the Hall of the Demonic Way, the elite training facility that only accepted the most talented believers of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nThwack!\nHer palm shot out faster than anyone watching could perceive and hit the attacking man square in the stomach.\n\"Kuh...\"\nThe man who'd started the confrontation collapsed with a choked groan.\nThe eyes of the woman who'd rushed over to stop him went wide with shock.\n'Oh my. So quiet and dignified, yet so capable...'\nShe wasn't actually quiet by nature. She simply kept her mouth shut because conversing with people was difficult for her.\nBut regardless of Jeong Hyeon's actual circumstances, that woman was already completely smitten.\nAnd she wasn't the only one.\nEvery woman sitting in the tea house who'd been watching the scene unfold felt a storm of emotions surging through their heart.\nThe Jade-Faced Young Master with that androgynous charm and beautiful face actually possessed enough strength to subdue a troublemaker with a single strike.\nThose combinations are absolutely lethal for these women.\nThe woman who'd chased after the man understood immediately. This place was crawling with hyenas all eyeing the same prey.\nSo she acted boldly.\nThe idiot she'd been sitting with had just given her the perfect opening, and she was going to take it.\n\"A-are you alright? That must have been so scary...\"\nAs the blushing woman initiated conversation, Jeong Hyeon couldn't help but be amazed.\n'It's... it's actually going exactly like Young Master said it would!'\nIl-mok had told her that she wouldn't need to open her mouth for the mission.\nShe just needed to sit in the tea house, and women would approach her on their own.\nOf course, even Il-mok hadn't predicted this exact scenario would unfold. He'd simply expected that if they threw out bait and waited, someone would bite.\nEither way, things were proceeding according to Il-mok's predictions, so Jeong Hyeon acted as he'd instructed.\nEven though she felt like she was suffocating with the girl standing so close, Jeong Hyeon pulled a folded note from her sleeve and handed it over.\nSwoosh.\n\"Wh-what's this?\"\nJeong Hyeon didn't answer the woman's question. She simply stood up silently and brushed past her to leave the tea house.\nThe woman stared after Jeong Hyeon's departing figure with a dazed expression before finally coming to her senses and unfolding the letter the Jade-Faced Young Master had left behind.\nWritten on it were a location and a time.\n'A... a private meeting with me!'\nShe interpreted it as an invitation from the Jade-Faced Young Master.\nIt was an invitation, all right.\nJust an invitation to a religious gathering.\nMeanwhile...\nA few shadowy figures had been watching the whole scene go down from a distance. They waited for Jeong Hyeon to leave, then followed her into a nearby alley.\n\"Hahaha! Did you see that magnificent performance? That's the acting I personally taught her!\"\nBaek Cheon looked at his three new disciples with an expression overflowing with pride.\nBut the three women's faces were less than impressed.\n'No matter how I look at it, that didn't seem like acting...'\n'Ugh. What's the point? He'll just hear what he wants to hear.'\nIn a single day, the women had come to realize that Baek Cheon was a lunatic.\nMeanwhile, Baek Cheon's eyes were blazing with fervor.\n'Young Master truly is a genius! To create such a powerful scene with no dialogue, just pure stage direction! Incredible!'\nTrue to someone who'd devoted his life to acting, he couldn't help but be deeply impressed by Il-mok's staging of this situation.\nAnd also true to someone obsessed with acting, he wasn't content to just stand there admiring it.\n\"Now then! You've witnessed your senior's splendid performance firsthand, so now it's your turn to step up!\"\nWith those words, Baek Cheon took the lead and emerged from the alley, while the three women behind him all sighed in unison as they watched his back.\nThat evening.\nThe recruitment teams started trickling back to the cult’s local headquarters.\nFirst to return were Baek Cheon and the three women who'd been working the streets. The next was the Jade-Faced Young Master Jeong Hyeon who'd a trail of broken hearts in her wake. The last one was the trio of Seon-ah, Jin Hayeon, and Ouyang Mun.\nSeon-ah and Jin Hayeon had been on bodyguard duty, but once Dam Bin and Ju Seo-yeon woke up from their nap and took over, they headed out to help with the recruitment drive.\nOuyang Mun, who had also just woken up, tagged along.\nOf course, Jin Hayeon and Hyeokryeon Seon-ah were assigned to male proselytization while Ouyang Mun handled female proselytization, so they had to work separately.\nThe first stop for most of the returning teams was the bathhouse.\nThe three women were exhausted after spending several hours wandering the marketplace talking to men, and Jeong Hyeon was in the same state.\nNormally, she preferred bathing alone at different times from everyone else, but she had no choice today.\nDespite having learned martial arts and mostly just sitting around all day, her body was drenched in sweat. Just sitting there and letting all those girls stare at her had taken a huge mental toll.\nJin Hayeon, who'd barely broken a sweat, went to attend to Il-mok. Ouyang Mun followed her, and Hyeokryeon Seon-ah headed to the bathhouse.\nShe needed to wash off the black dye she'd applied to hide her distinctive red hair.\nSo as the five women began undressing to enter the bathhouse together...\n\"......\"\nThe three women who'd been learning acting from Baek Cheon stood there staring somewhere with dazed expressions.\n'T-those... can be hidden with bandages?'\nThe women couldn't help but be impressed. More than anything else—\n'He saw that and still decided to make her dress up as a man...'\n—They were impressed by Il-mok's decisiveness.\nThey couldn't help but think she would have been an absolute knockout if she'd been working as a femme fatale instead of a pretty boy.\n\"Eep.\"\nJeong Hyeon, who'd had similar experiences back at the Hall of the Demonic Way, quickly crossed her arms over her chest with a startled expression.\n'Th-This is exactly why I hate group baths.'\nJust as she was resigning herself to the awkwardness, she felt another pair of eyes locked onto her.\nIt was Hyeokryeon Seon-ah.\nJeong Hyeon felt something strange about the girl's stare.\nHaving spent time together, Jeong Hyeon had noticed something peculiar about Hyeokryeon Seon-ah.\nHer attitude was completely different depending on whether Il-mok was nearby or not.\nIt wasn’t like she was mean to people or anything.\nIt was just that when Il-mok was around, she was sweet and friendly to everyone. But the second he was gone, she couldn’t care less about any of them.\nHyeokryeon Seol-ah, the girl who only bothered being nice when Il-mok was watching, was having an epiphany.\nShe knew full well that Il-mok still saw her as a little kid or at best a younger sister.\nSince Il-mok had openly stated that he preferred women who reached their prime, denying it would be foolish.\nIn other words, Il-mok liked mature women.\n'If I had those, I'd have a chance too...'\nJeong Hyeon felt a chill run down her spine as she saw the way Hyeokryeon Seon-ah’s eyes blazed.\nMeanwhile, completely unaware of the drama going down in the bathhouse…\n\"I've returned from the proselytization mission, Young Master.\" Thıs text ıs hosted at N0v3l.Fiɾe.net\nIl-mok nodded at Jin Hayeon’s report.\n\"Good work. Ah, and did Young Master Baek Cheon return as well?\"\n\"Yes, Young Master.\"\n\"Then please call Young Master Baek Cheon here.\"\nThe moment Il-mok's order fell, Jin Hayeon turned and headed out again with Ju Seo-yeon and Ouyang Mun trying to follow her.\n\"You two stay here.\"\nThe sight of them frozen still with desperate eyes made Il-mok shake his head.\nA moment later, when Jin Hayeon returned with Baek Cheon and their expressions brightened.\n'Seriously, they're like a couple of dogs.'\nThey were the spitting image of dogs panting and wagging their tails happily when their owner returned home after leaving for work.\n'…But what do you call a puppy whose owner doesn't actually want to see? Not exactly a pet, but closer to a nuisance.’\nWhile Il-mok was entertaining such a trivial thought, Baek Cheon spoke up.\n\"What can I do for you, Young Master?\"\n\"Ah. Actually, I called you here because I have an important task to entrust to you, Young Master Baek Cheon.\"\n\"To me?\"\nIl-mok nodded gravely.\nHe hadn’t just been sitting on his butt all day while the others were out working.\nHe’d spent some time training to keep his own alter ego under control, and the rest of the day he'd just been thinking.\n'Even if I have to stoop to dirty tricks, I will achieve Transcendence!'\nThanks to his damn obsessive compulsion, once one problem popped into his head, his thoughts wouldn't stop.\nSo after he'd solved the gender-balance issue with the Jade-Faced Young Master Bait, another issue had surfaced in Il-mok's mind.\nNamely, concerns about the gathering that would be held in two days.\nThis gathering and proselytization in Lanzhou were different from what happened in Gulang County.\nIn Gulang County, they'd held the gathering and proselytization, then heightened the believers' faith by punishing the scums of the Red Serpent Gang afterward.\nBut this time, they needed to take advantage of the element of surprise, so they had to flip the script and deal with the Heavenly Orchid Society first before starting proselytization.\nRight after that, they'd gone to the places the Heavenly Orchid Society controlled and brought them under the Maitreya Luminous Cult's umbrella, but...\n‘That was less like proselytizing and more like a hostile takeover.’\nHe knew that even if the people from the brothels showed up to the meeting, they'd just be sitting there, scared stiff. Their motivation would be fear, not faith.\nThey couldn't hold a gathering with only people like that, which was partly why he’d conducted proselytization activities in the marketplace just like in Gulang County.\nBut that just created new problems.\nThose coming from brothels and taverns would be terrified, while those lured in by honey traps or pretty-boy traps would arrive confused, not even knowing what the Maitreya Luminous Cult was.\nIt could be described as a situation where two groups with no commonalities would coexist.\nHe racked his brain for a way to unite these two clashing groups and break the horrible, awkward tension.\nAnd Il-mok finally managed to find a solution.\n\"This is something only you can accomplish, Young Master Baek Cheon.\"\nNamely, by utilizing the attention-seeker known as Baek Cheon.\n“If it’s for the glory of the cult and to get me attention, I'll accomplish it no matter what it takes, Young Master!\"\nAt Baek Cheon's firm answer, Il-mok smiled brightly.\n\"Then from now on, follow along with the song I'm about to sing and memorize the lyrics, melody, and rhythm.\"\nThe solution Il-mok had devised for unity.\n“I’ve got peaace~ liiike~ a river. I’ve got peaace~ liiike~ a river.”\nIt was a church song.",

    "content": "Chapter 199: Proselytization (3)\nBy the time Il-mok finished the song, Baek Cheon was looking at him with tears streaming down his face.\n“I see now what a fool I’ve been, Young Master! To think I had the audacity to spread the greatness of the Divine Cult through theater and gain attention, yet never once thought of using songs. My vision was so small, so pathetic! I’m so ashamed I could cry!”\nWhich he was already doing. Then, he dramatically dropped to his knees.\n“I knew you were a genius at martial arts and strategy, but I never dreamed you were a musical prodigy as well! I want to gouge out these eyes of mine for failing to recognize Young Master's talents.\"\n\"Ahem. Well, gouging out your eyes is a bit much.\" Il-mok cleared his throat awkwardly and turned his head away.\nGetting praised for something he didn't even compose himself made him feel weird in various ways.\nBut, actually, that wasn't it at all.\n'Why the hell are they looking at me like I'm even worse than this lunatic?'\nThe people watching from the sidelines were staring at Il-mok like he was the attention-seeker of the century.\nEven Baek Cheon seemed to acknowledge him as being several levels above in their hierarchy, which made things even more uncomfortable.\n'I'm not an attention-whore, damn it!'\nThe whole reason he was singing right now was to dump the singer role at the assembly onto Baek Cheon.\n\"Ahem. It just came to me by chance. Come on, you try it.”\n\"Yes, Young Master!\"\nBaek Cheon stood up with the face of someone who'd been entrusted with a historic mission, his eyes shining with a clear light as he stared intently at Il-mok.\n'Ugh, this is uncomfortable.'\nHis eyes were already twinkling enough, but now they were getting misty too, which made Il-mok's skin crawl.\nWith a light sigh, Il-mok sang \"Peace Like a River\" one more time. Maybe because the song was simple, Baek Cheon managed to pick up the song without much difficulty.\nIl-mok nodded, \"Excellent. Then I'll teach you the next song as well.\"\nIl-mok planned to teach him several hymns in addition to \"Peace Like a River.\"\nFor Il-mok—or rather, for his past self, Seo Ji-hoon—church songs were surprisingly familiar.\nIt wasn't because he was a religious person. Seo Ji-hoon was a huge believer in work-life balance; the idea of giving up his Sundays for church was his personal definition of hell.\nNo, he knew hymns because he had survived a famously terrible time in a man's life. A special kind of hell that most South Korean men are forced to go through.\n'Goddamn boot camp.'\nAnd with that, Il-mok started to teach the song that had been mercilessly drilled into his head during that awful time.\n“Through the dark of the night, through the pitch-black of night, we journey onward to the dawn!”\nA song he’d picked up at Nonsan Training Center because he was starving for snacks at that time.\nA song that boasted a club-like atmosphere.\nSiloam.\n\"Oh Maitreya, we shall thank you. For giving us light.\"\nAfter completing Nonsan Training Center, he continued going to church on weekends to get snacks and avoid harassment from his seniors. Thanks to that, several hymns were branded into his mind like scars.\nThough it was a memory from nearly a decade ago, because it was his military days memory, it was stuck in one corner of his mind like PTSD and wouldn't go away.\nHe'd even heard hymns occasionally during his time working as a social welfare civil servant whenever he got involved with volunteer organizations.\nOne way or another, the organizations most closely related to volunteering were Christian and Catholic groups.\nMaybe the tune was just that simple, or maybe Baek Cheon was just a natural, but he memorized Siloam just as fast as the first song.\n‘Is this why they are so hard to erase from one’s memory?’\nHymns are designed to be sung by a big crowd of normal people, so they have to be catchy and easy to learn.\nThey were so catchy to the point where they got on the list of \"songs you can't listen to during exam season\" because they'd get stuck in your head forever.\nHe could already picture of future in his mind.\nA scene where all the people of Lanzhou sang Siloam together.\nAfter learning two hymns from Il-mok, Baek Cheon returned to his quarters and was singing those glorious songs again.\n‘The Young Master could have easily sung these before the believers himself, yet he yielded the honor to me. This too is the Young Master’s grace!’\nHe saw it as nothing less than grace as vast as the heavens. And so Baek Cheon immersed himself in practice with the mindset of a prophet carrying a religious mission.\nAs he practiced his singing, a certain epiphany suddenly struck Baek Cheon's mind.\n'Wait a minute?'\n'Young Master told me to use songs to spread our Divine Cult’s graces far and wide. And at the Hall of the Demonic Way, he told me to spread the Divine Cult’s greatness through theater.'\nAs he recalled the two great missions Il-mok had bestowed upon him, he arrived at a shocking conclusion.\n'Why am I doing them separately?'\nAnd just like that, his imagination went into overdrive.\nWhat if he depicted the great achievements of the past Heavenly Demons using the play, and at the most crucial moments of the play, sang magnificent songs with his majestic voice?\nA scene emerged from his mind.\nA scene where people were completely engrossed in his bewitching play, chanting his name and looking up at him with adoration.\nThud.\nBefore he knew it, he'd sat down on the floor in a meditative position, and inspiration overflowed in his mind like a bursting spring.\nAnd in tune with that inspiration, the demonic energy of the Hundred Flower Demonic Art coiled in Baek Cheon's dantian escaped and began flowing through his limbs.\nThe side effect of the Hundred Flower Demonic Art was a pathological need to be the center of attention.\n'Yes! And for the finale, I'll shower the stage with flower petals, scattering them like a storm of hidden weapons!'\n'I've been trapped in narrow-minded thinking all this time! Just as I can mix theater and songs, there's no rule saying I must only execute the Three Forms with the Feather Arrow Needles!'\nWhile pondering ways to draw more attention, Baek Cheon gained even greater enlightenment about martial arts.\nThe next morning.\n\"Young Master! Young Master!\"\nThe familiar voice of a madman coming from outside the door made Il-mok sigh and get up.\n\"Come in.\"\nAs soon as Il-mok's voice fell, Baek Cheon, Dam Bin, and Hyeokryeon Seon-ah, who'd been standing guard, entered the room.\n\"Why are you raising hell—I mean, why the commotion so early in the morning?\"\nIl-mok had unintentionally blurted out his true feelings in his drowsiness, but it didn't register in the energetic Baek Cheon's ears. Not that it mattered, Baek Cheon had always been the type to only hear what he wanted to hear anyway.\n\"Last night, this Baek Cheon came to understand Young Master's great intention.\"\n\"???\"\nIl-mok wondered what nonsense this was now, but before he could ask, Baek Cheon suddenly bowed to him.\n“First, you told me to spread the word through plays. Now, you’ve told me to spread the word through song. It all makes sense! Your real plan was for me to combine them!”\n\"......\"\nIl-mok frowned.\n'A play that combines songs and acting... so he's invented the musical theater?'\nThis crazy bastard had somehow managed to create the world's first musical drama.\n'Then again, opera and pansori are also forms of musical theater, but does this world have opera or pansori? If they do exist, this would be a perfect opportunity to send this crazy bastard abroad to learn them.'\nBut then he thought that getting rid of the madman was probably the more urgent priority. Right after finishing spreading the hymns in Lanzhou, that is.\nUnaware of Il-mok’s plan, Baek Cheon continued rambling.\n\"While realizing Young Master's deep intention and swimming in an ocean of inspiration, this Baek came to understand. Since all the rivers return to the sea, all these realizations are also connected to the Hundred Flower Demonic Art that I've learned. Thanks to Young Master's teachings, this Baek one has broken through a barrier!\"\nBaek Cheon then repeatedly bowed as if ready to split his forehead on the floor.\nAt that devout posture, Dam Bin and Hyeokryeon Seon-ah, who were watching from the side, also showed surprised expressions.\n“I’d heard the rumors that people get stronger just by being around you, Young Master, but I never imagined you taught him songs with such intention. Incredible.\"\n\"As expected of Big Brother! Teach me something, too! I’m ready! I’ll learn anything!”\nNow that all three of them were looking at him like he was some kind of god, Il-mok just gave a weak cough. “Uh, that really wasn’t my intention.”\nFor some reason, it felt as though he himself was being lumped into the same category as Baek Cheon.\n\"Hohoho. You're even being humble about it.\"\n“You truly are the greatest!”\nThey just would not believe him.\n\"Haah...\"\nIl-mok let out a deep sigh and gave up.\nThe next evening, at a riverbank just outside the city.\nIn a somewhat dark place a short distance away from the washing spot where housewives did laundry during the day, countless people had gathered there.\nAbout two-thirds of them gave off an atmosphere of being tense and trembling with fear, while the remaining third harbored feelings of excitement or bewilderment.\nThe tense and fearful ones were people from brothels and taverns, while the excited or bewildered ones were people who'd been lured by the honey trap and missionary work and had come out of curiosity. ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ novel(ꜰ)ire.net\nThe groups with completely different atmospheres couldn't mix at all, their only common point being that they kept looking around as if searching for someone.\nAnd in that unsettled atmosphere, someone revealed themselves.\n\"Today, I wish to deliver benevolent messages to all the believers who have come to our Maitreya Luminous Cult's gathering.\"\nThe speaker was a middle-aged man wearing a mask of a wrathful deity. It was none other than the Branch Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's Lanzhou Branch.\nThe people from brothels and taverns who knew of the Maitreya Luminous Cult's existence looked at him with tense faces, while those lured by the honey trap looked at him with faces full of questions.\n'Maitreya Luminous Cult?'\n'Benevolent messages?'\n'What's he talking about?'\nIn the midst of this, the Branch Leader's sermon began.\n“We are the Maitreya Luminous Cult! We are the ones who wait for the coming of the great savior, Maitreya, who will purge this wicked world and save us all! And I tell you now, the savior is close! For Incarnations of Maitreya has already come to Lanzhou and wiped the filth of the Heavenly Orchid Society from our city! This is the sign we have been waiting for!”\nHearing that the Heavenly Orchid Society had been taken out by some kind of divine being, the curious people in the crowd started whispering excitedly.\nIn that unsettled atmosphere, the Branch Leader cried out.\n“And now, to begin, let us sing together a song to honor the Incarnations of Maitreya who descended for our sake and fought against the wicked.\"\nAs soon as his words ended, Baek Cheon stepped forward.\nHe wasn't even wearing a mask.\nAs a wave of whispers went through the crowd at the sight of his handsome face, Baek Cheon felt a jolt of pure ecstasy as if he'd immediately ascend to heaven.\n\"The song you will sing with me today is 'We Shall Fight Against the Wicked.’”\nLike the true attention hog he is, Baek Cheon boldly declared and began singing.\nFollowing \"Peace Like a River\" and \"Siloam,\" there was another hymn he'd learned from Il-mok.\n\"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.\"\nA hymn that Il-mok thought might align most closely with the doctrine of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\n“He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat; He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat…”\nA song so simple and famous that even people who didn't know hymns would know at least its chorus.\n“GLOOORY! GLORY! MAITREYA CUULT! GLOOORY! GLORY! MAITREYA CUULT!”\nThe hymn known as \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic.\"",

    "content": "Chapter 200: Proselytization (4)\nWhile Baek Cheon belted out the hymn with crystal-clear eyes radiating magnificence, everyone gathered at the rally was showing lukewarm reactions at best.\nWhich made perfect sense. The whole thing was out of the blue, and the song was totally new to them.\nBut Baek Cheon wasn't the type to get swept up in that kind of atmosphere.\nWhat mattered to him was simply the fact that everyone was looking at him.\nWithout batting an eye, he started singing the first verse of ‘We Shall Fight the Wicked.’\nHe had no choice. Il-mok wasn't a genuine Christian believer, so even with famous hymns, he only knew the first verse.\nAnd the moment his song reached the chorus again—\n“Glo~ ry! Glory! O’ Divine Cult!!”\n“Glo~ ry! Glory! O’ Divine Cult!!”\nAnd just like that, a few voices from the crowd started echoing the ridiculously catchy chorus.\nThese were the people Il-mok had planted. More precisely, members of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's branch.\nJust like the saying \"three men make a tiger,\" humans were naturally prone to getting swept up in the surrounding atmosphere.\n\"It's a weird song, I'll give you that.\"\n“But isn’t it quite catchy?”\n\"Oddly uplifting, I'd say.\"\nThe hymn was so insanely catchy that it made even those who knew nothing and just showed up to the gathering feel their lips itching to join in.\n“Glo~ ry! Glory! O’ Divine Cult!!”\n“Glo~ ry! Glory! O’ Divine Cult!!”\nBy the third round of the chorus, everyone had started singing along with excited faces.\nMeanwhile...\nSitting leisurely on a tree branch some distance from the rally location, Il-mok let out a soft sigh as he watched the intensely religious scene unfold.\nHe'd wanted to leave the gathering in someone else's hands and rest at the branch, but in the end, he had no choice but to secretly come to the gathering site.\nIt was because of his obsessive tendencies. Delegating work to others was fine, but he needed to check things with his own eyes at least once to feel at ease.\n'Good thing I came.'\nAnd thanks to that compulsion, Il-mok gained a small harvest.\nIt wasn't that the hymn was a bigger hit than he’d thought.\nIt was that there were a bunch of filthy, grime-caked beggars mixed in with the crowd.\n\"Tch. So the Beggar Gang’s rats already caught wind of this.\"\nAnd not just any beggars, but beggars who'd learned martial arts.\nThe Nine Sects and One Gang, and the Seven Great Families—these were the major powers of the Central Plains. Among the Nine Sects and One Gang, the \"One Gang\" referred to the Beggar Gang.\nThe Beggar Gang, counted as one of the Central Plains martial world's colossal forces, was exactly what its name suggested: a gathering of beggars.\nOriginally, the Beggar Gang wasn't created by beggars who learned martial arts. Rather, it was formed when someone who'd learned martial arts protected beggars.\nIn the past, during an era of war when the rulers of the Central Plains changed one after another, countless beggars appeared throughout the land. A certain chivalrous warrior decided to start protecting them, and the whole thing grew from there.\nHe was called the Founding Ancestor of the Beggar Gang. The martial arts he passed down to the beggars so they could protect themselves, along with his noble intentions, were transmitted through generations, naturally forming the organization known as the Beggar Gang.\nBut despite the Founding Ancestor's noble intentions and efforts, even after hundreds of years had passed, countless beggars still wandered throughout the world. Before anyone knew it, the Beggar Gang had transformed into one of the Central Plains' biggest intelligence organizations.\nSince you can find beggars literally everywhere, they became the perfect spies. They'd collect all the gossip and intel they overheard while begging, package it up, sell it for cash, and use the profits to feed their own.\nOf course, Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu, was crawling with beggars as well and had a branch of Beggar Gang to look after them.\n“The hell you sayin’?”\nThe question came from Hong Gae, the Five-Knot Beggar who served as a Branch Leader in Lanzhou. A young, three-knot beggar sighed before answering him.\n\"Are your ears clogged too now? I'm saying the Heavenly Orchid Society is over!\"\nAt the Three-Knot disciple's attitude that showed zero promise, Hong Gae smacked the back of the young beggar's head and said:\n\"Did you trade away all your manners for taffy now? That’s how you're talking to your boss?\"\n\"They say if you starve for five days, even the Emperor won’t be different from a beggar. You think I care about being polite to a Branch Leader?” His eyes were practically glittering with murderous intent.\nThe Three-Knot Beggar’s response made Hong Gae's face turn beet red like his name.\n(TL Note: Hong Gae literally means red beggar.)\n\"Get good and beg better, kid! Blame your own scary-ass face. Who the hell do you think you're talking back to?\"\n\"Is this about my face right now? The whole damn neighborhood's a shitshow, and it’s all because of that goddamn Heavenly Orchid Society!”\nThe Branch Leader clicked his tongue.\nThe kid had a point.\nThere's an old saying: it's easy to be kind when your own pantry is full. Thanks to the Heavenly Orchid Society's evil bullshit, the people of Lanzhou were anything but kind.\nJust like the saying \"generosity comes from full granaries,\" thanks to the Heavenly Orchid Society's vicious deeds, the people's goodwill in Lanzhou had hit rock bottom.\nMost people were too busy trying to survive themselves, so those willing to give alms to beggars could be counted on one hand.\nBut the real reason the Three-Knot Beggar was furious wasn't because he'd failed at begging.\nHe was mad because he felt useless, watching the whole city go to hell and being completely unable to stop it.\nHe'd been a beggar his whole life, but he'd joined the gang and learned to fight because he wanted to do good.\nBut he never got the chance to use his skills here.\nThat's because it was impossible for the local beggars to win against the Heavenly Orchid Society. Even Hong Gae, a Five-Knot Beggar and Branch Leader, fell far short of the Heavenly Orchid Society's leader in skill.\nTo cleanly eliminate the Heavenly Orchid Society without casualties, the Sect Leader or an Eight-Knot Elder would need to step in, but they were too busy with affairs elsewhere to spare attention for Gansu.\nThe Central Plains were simply too vast, and within the Central Plains, Gansu Province was a backwater.\nIn that sense, the Heavenly Orchid Society's leader was pretty damn clever. While selling women and doing all sorts of trashy shit, he didn't touch the beggars.\nHe wanted to avoid incurring the Beggar Gang's wrath by messing with beggars.\nYou could almost call it a twisted kind of partnership. After all, the Heavenly Orchid Society was in the business of ruining lives and creating new beggars.\nOf course, with his youthful hot-headedness combined with overflowing righteousness, the Three-Knot Beggar was itching to go up against the Heavenly Orchid Society even if it meant his own death. But he couldn't dare challenge the Heavenly Orchid Society's leader.\nIt was because of the middle-aged beggar standing right before him, Branch Leader Hong Gae.\nThere was an order from the Sect Leader to keep an eye on things in Gansu and told them not to throw their lives away for a stupid reason.\nThe order came around a year ago and basically told them to keep their heads down and be even more miserable if possible.\nSeeing the young beggar simmering with a year's worth of suppressed anger, the Branch Leader changed his tactic and spoke as if consoling him.\n\"Well, at least now you won't have to worry about food for a while.\"\n\"Why? Because the Heavenly Orchid Society is gone?”\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"But what if the bastards who took down the Heavenly Orchid Society are even worse? Wouldn’t we be totally screwed for good then?”\n\"Ugh, you ignorant fool.\"\n“Hey, we’re both beggars. It’s not like either of us went to school.”\nAs the young disciple grumbled, Hong Gae shot back with a smirk.\n“People can be smart even if they didn’t go to school, you little shit. The kind of people who can wipe out the Heavenly Orchid Society in a single day are either some secret masters who’ve been hiding out or a whole new group, correct? Don’t you think the headquarters would pay good money for info on people like that?”\n\"Ah!!\"\nWhen the young beggar finally understood what the Branch Leader meant, Hong Gae grinned. A smile with yellowed teeth and dirt streaming down. Newest update provıded by N()velFire.net\n\"Let's use this opportunity to get some money from headquarters and feed our guys some meat soup for once.\"\nBy morning on the day the Heavenly Orchid Society fell, collapsed, a special order had gone out to every beggar in Lanzhou.\nA directive to obtain information on the individual or group that had destroyed the Heavenly Orchid Society, along with a very enticing bait of stewed meat soup if they got their info correct.\nBut beggars aren't idiots. In fact, living on the streets had made them experts at reading the lines in between.\nThey didn't make the stupid mistake of running around asking people about whoever took down the Heavenly Orchid Society. Instead, they just did their own thing. Begging on the streets, inducing pity from housewives washing near the downstream, and hanging around taverns or brothels.\nThey just begged all over Lanzhou, and kept their ears open.\nAnd the countless bits of information the beggars picked up were passed to the Beggar Gang disciples, who organized that information and passed it back to the Branch Leader.\n\"So these Maitreya Luminous Cult bastards took out the Heavenly Orchid Society?\"\n“Yep. That’s the word on the street, at least in the red-light district. The rumor’s everywhere over there.”\n\"So where's their base?\"\n“No idea.”\n\"What?\"\nHong Gai looked baffled, but the Three-Knot disciple answered shamelessly.\n“They took credit for sacking the Heavenly Orchid Society and took over the red-light district, but they never said where they were staying. It’s all just talk right now. They just told everyone to show up for a gathering tonight and then disappeared.”\nThen, the kid’s eyes lit up as if he’d just remembered something.\n“Oh! And they killed all the brothel owners who talked back.”\n\"All of them?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n“...Sounds like they’re even bigger monsters than the Heavenly Orchid Society.”\n\"They seemed like good guys to me though?\"\nHearing that, Hong Gai’s face twisted in disgust.\n\"Did all that begging finally rot your brain?\"\n“What? They killed the bad guys! We got a word from Gulang just now, and it said they wiped out the Black Path’s scums over there. Red Serpent Gang or something. Then they gave all their money away to the townspeople.”\n“Gave the money away?”\n\"Yes. So like, what was it? They said that if you just believe in and follow their doctrine, then one day Maitreya will come down to earth, all the evil people will die, and the good people will see the light. Something like that was their doctrine anyway.\"\n\"So they're the type who help good people and kill all the bad ones?\"\n“Yeah. See? They’re the good guys!\"\n“You goddamn idiot.”\nIn the end, Hong Gae couldn't hold back and smacked the back of the Three-Knot disciple's head.\n“Hey! I’m already light-headed from hunger. Why do you keep hitting my head, you f—... for what reason, sir!”\nHong Gai knew the kid had been about to say \"fucker\" or something similar before catching himself, but he decided to let it slide.\nHe just let out a light sigh.\n'The doctrine itself sounds fine, but these guys are bad news.’\nHe was old and he’d been a beggar for decades. Throughout his few decades of life, Hong Gae learned a thing or two, and his gut was telling him something about this.\nHe knew that just because a group has a pretty face doesn’t mean it isn’t rotten to the core.\nEspecially since several of the Central Plains' major orthodox sects were like that.\n“You said the gathering is tonight? Where?”\nThat night.\nHong Gae followed the info from other beggars and went to the location of the Maitreya Luminous Cult's assembly.\nHe’d ordered all the regular beggars to stay away and led only himself and the Beggar Gang martial artists.\nIt was just in case things went south. He didn't want a bunch of civilians getting slaughtered for nothing.\nHe scanned the area and opened his qi perception to the max as if he wouldn't miss even the slightest detail.\nFirst up was some guy in a wrathful deity mask, who started spouting some weird sermon.\n“We are the Maitreya Luminous Cult! We are the ones who wait for the coming of the great savior, Maitreya, who will purge this wicked world and save us all!\nFollowing that, a young man who did not even bother to cover his face stepped forward and began to sing.\n‘You’ve got to be kidding me.’\nHong Gae could barely keep a straight face as he watched the pretty boy singing.\n‘That much power at his age?!’\nThe kid looked like he was barely twenty. He was so young you couldn't even really call him one of the rising stars yet, but his cultivation was easily on the same level as Hong Gae himself, a Five-Knot Beggar.\n'...He's on par with the Seven Dragons and Two Phoenix.'\nHe couldn't help but think of the nine rising stars of the new generation who'd been making the biggest waves in the Central Plains recently.\nWhile Hong Gae hid his surprise internally, realizing that the Maitreya Luminous Cult’s power was no joke, the gathering’s atmosphere had completely changed.\nOne by one, people started singing along.\n'What is this? Brainwashing?'\nThe song was so damn catchy that it put him even more on edge. He glanced around to check his surroundings and immediately shut his eyes shut.\n“Glo~ ry! Glory! O’ Divine Cult!!”\nBecause the young beggars are singing along more enthusiastically than anyone else.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 201 : Investigation (1)",
    "content": "Chapter 201: Investigation (1)\nThe first gathering of the Maitreya Luminous Cult was quite a success.\nThe Branch Leader kept his mask on while he preached, and whenever the atmosphere started getting a bit rowdy again—\n\"Give me peace~ like a river~!\"\n\"Give me peace~ like a river~!\"\nWithout fail, Baek Cheon would step forward and lead the hymns to get everyone fired up and engaged.\nPlus, the sermon didn't drag on forever. They wrapped it up in about half an hour.\n\"Everyone must be getting hungry by now, so please take some of the late-night snacks we have prepared.”\nThe moment the Branch Leader finished speaking, several people appeared pulling carts loaded with dumplings and pancakes.\nSome were errand boys from the brothels that Il-mok had ordered around as manual laborers, while others were the honey trap operatives who'd been out proselytizing.\nSince there were so many people at the gathering, it would've been impossible for just the cult members to prepare this much food on their own.\nNaturally, they’d outsourced the cooking to the cooks at the brothels.\nBut Il-mok didn't feel the slightest burden about ordering all these snacks. After all, he was using part of the massive fortune seized from the Heavenly Orchid Society to pay for labor costs.\nThe cooks who prepared the snacks and the errand boys distributing them from the carts were all so pleased with their generous wages that they were practically grinning.\nThose who'd attended the gathering found the person who'd brought them here and headed toward their cart to receive snacks.\n\"Miss! There you are!\"\n\"I was away for a moment preparing snacks for all of you.\"\nThe three women who’d been captured by the Heavenly Orchid Society Leader before unexpectedly becoming honey trap agents handed out the snacks with surprising competence.\n“Here.”\nJin Hayeon just passed out the food with her usual ice-queen vibe.\n“My, isn't she the very picture of aloofness?”\n“With a face like that, doesn’t she have the right to be? You could call her the most beautiful woman in Lanzhou and it wouldn't be an exaggeration.\"\nCountless men found themselves utterly mesmerized by that very aloofness.\n\"Um... Young warrior?\"\n\"Ahem. I'd like some snacks too, if you don't mind?\"\nThe problem was that both Ouyang Mun and Ju Seo-yeon were so busy staring at her that they’d completely forgotten to give food to the people standing right in front of them.\n\"Hahaha! Everyone, please eat comfortably! This is prepared by our Maitreya Luminous Cult. Oh, and if you'd like, I could sing another song for you! Or would you prefer to see a play?\"\nMeanwhile, Baek Cheon had also moved in front of a cart and was running his mouth while distributing snacks.\n\"......\"\nOnly one guy was handing out snacks in total silence.\nBut whether he talked or not didn't matter, because the people getting food from him were buzzing with excitement.\n\"That pale face and those melancholy eyes... He looked even more dazzling up close under the moonlight.\"\n\"And he's so dignified.\" ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ novel⸺fire.net\nThe man silently distributing snacks was none other than Jeong Hyeon.\nShe was using every last ounce of her willpower to fight off the side effects of her Demonic Art while working.\n\"I almost hugged him without thinking.\"\nWhen a woman who’d just gotten a snack whispered that to her friend, Jeong Hyeon nearly jumped out of her skin.\nMaybe it was the free food, or maybe it was because the gorgeous people who'd led them here had appeared, an energetic buzz started to fill the air.\n“Huh? Where’s that younger sister of yours I saw the other day?”\nIn the midst of all this, a man who'd received snacks from Jin Hayeon asked with curiosity.\n\"She's not feeling well today, so she's resting at home.\"\nJin Hayeon answered in her indifferent tone, but this was a lie.\nSince Hyeokryeon Seon-ah had also gone out proselytizing, she was supposed to be handing out snacks here as well.\nThe plan had been changed at the last minute because Il-mok gave a new order.\n—Beggar Gang’s members are here. Just in case, Seon-ah will sit out the snack distribution.\nFrom his perch in a nearby tree, Il-mok had quickly sent out the order to his people.\nIt was because the cultivation level of the oldest-looking beggar among them was comparable to Baek Cheon's.\nOnce Il-mok sized up the middle-aged beggar, Il-mok quickly organized his thoughts.\n'That attention-whore Baek Cheon can't be hidden anyway. Might as well use him as a decoy and make sure they only pay attention to him.’\nThe growth of Demonic Arts practitioners was absurdly fast. On top of that, the people he'd brought with him generally had higher achievements for their age even by the cult’s standards.\nEspecially Hyeokryeon Seon-ah.\nShe was only fifteen this year, but her martial realm is already at the early stage of Peak Realm by Centrail Plains’ standards. To make matters worse, she had the telltale red hair and eyes.\nThat problem was exactly why Seon-ah had to dye her hair black every time they left the branch office.\n‘If people notice how strong she is for her age, they'll start looking closer, and sooner or later, they’ll spot the hair or eyes.’\nFor that reason, Il-mok ordered Hyeokryeon Seon-ah to sit this one out.\nAnd right now, she had climbed up into the tree where Il-mok was hiding and was sitting on a branch next to him with a beaming smile.\nShe just watched him as he stared down at the rally with a serious look.\nThe reason Il-mok specifically excluded only Seon-ah was simple.\nThe Beggar Gang’s top expert could only notice Baek Cheon, Ju Seo-yeon, and Jeong Hyeon since his realm was similar to theirs, and by extension, Seon-ah.\nAs for Ouyang Mun and Jin Hayeon, they are several levels above that middle-aged beggar, so it would be difficult for him to notice them.\nOn top of that, with the three women serving as honey trap operatives and the errand boys pulling carts mixed in, it would be even harder for him to get a clear picture.\nBut Il-mok still hadn't fully kicked his obsessive habits, so just in case, he kept a close eye on the beggars' every move.\nRealizing that Il-mok's gaze was fixed on the beggars, Hyeokryeon Seon-ah asked with a smile.\n\"Should I kill them, big brother?\"\n\"...There's no need to go that far.\"\nWhen Il-mok answered half-heartedly, Hyeokryeon Seon-ah asked again.\n\"Then should I cripple their legs so they can't come to the gatherings anymore?\"\n\"Ahem. It’ll be troublesome if we poke them and the whole Beggar Gang comes after us. Let's just watch them for now.”\nHalf of it was just excuses, but the other half was genuine.\nHe genuinely didn't want to poke the hornet's nest that was the Beggar Gang when nothing had even happened yet.\n‘She’s only fifteen, and yet…'\nThe other half of it was trying to tone down her killing intent.\n‘This is what a bad childhood upbringing does to you. Man, those crazy cultists are the worst.’\nIl-mok looked at the girl who'd received twisted teachings since childhood with pity and patted her head.\nThat gentle touch made Hyeokryeon Seon-ah grin from ear to ear as she made a promise to herself.\n‘I’m going to kill anyone who ever bothers him.’\nYeah, it probably had less to do with her upbringing and more to do with Il-mok.\nz\nMeanwhile.\nUnaware that an unhinged assassin was eyeing their necks, the Beggar Gang members had gathered together and were murmuring among themselves.\n“You damn morons. What got into you, singing your lungs out like that?”\nChewed out by Hong Gae, the Three-Knot beggar shot back without missing a beat.\n“It’s called blending in. Begging is all about reading the room. Can’t you use your brain, boss?”\n“...Oh, you were reading the room so well that you sang loud enough to shake the walls? How much food did you stuff in your face to get that much energy?\"\nAs Hong Gae kept chewing on them, the beggars subtly turned their heads to avoid his gaze.\nAll except a certain Three-Knot beggar.\n\"We're already starving anyway, so shouldn't we go get some of that free food?”\nHe pointed over to the carts where they were giving out late-night snacks.\n\"Hah. Fine, let's go, you rats. It'd look strange if beggars turned down charity.\"\nHearing that, all the beggars who’d been avoiding his eyes started grinning.\nThey may have entered the Beggar Gang and learned martial arts, but they were still beggars in the end. The sight of free, delicious-smelling food was enough to make them lose their minds.\nAs the beggars approached the carts with drool practically running down their chins, those gathered at the meeting frowned and moved aside.\nIt was a scene befitting the saying about avoiding people because they're dirty.\nBut through it all, Hong Gai was the only one who managed to stay focused and steadily survey his surroundings with his qi perception.\n'Hoh. That handsome young man over there and that airhead of a woman are also quite formidable.'\nThe taciturn, handsome young man by the cart where women were squealing and making a fuss, and a certain airhead of a woman at another spot.\nBoth of them were weaker than him, but they were definitely Peak Realm experts.\nAs he was scanning the area, he naturally fell behind the main group. By the time he caught up to a cart, he found himself at the one run by a certain ice queen.\n‘I’ve never seen a woman this beautiful in my entire life! Is this what they mean when they talk about the legendary Five Flowers of the martial arts world?’\nHe couldn't help but think of the five most beautiful young martial artists of the current era.\nAnd just like that, Hong Gae knew exactly why he'd ended up at this cart.\n‘Damn horny bastards!’\nHis young beggars had obviously lost their minds over this woman and made a beeline right for her.\nJust because they were beggars didn't mean they’re blind.\nAnd the ice queen didn't even flinch. She just kept her poker face on and handed out the food without a hint of being grossed out or annoyed.\n\"Hehehehe.\"\nThe sight of the pathetic beggars drooling and receiving food with dazed expressions made Hong Gae sigh inwardly.\n‘Whatever. What’s the big deal if beggars look pathetic?’\nHe decided to just pass it off as excellent acting. Otherwise, he felt he might fall ill from stress.\nWhen his turn finally came, Hong Gae decided to show them what real acting looked like.\n\"Ahem. Could you spare a few more for me?\"\nHe'd started begging like a proper beggar.\n\"There's a set number per person, so I'm afraid I can't give you more.\"\n“Please, it’s for my little brothers who couldn’t make it today. They’re so pitiful, begged all day and still haven’t had a bite to eat.”\nHe even managed to squeeze out a few tears. He looked so pathetic that anyone would have taken pity on him. But...\n\"That's not possible.\"\nIt didn't work at all on the ice queen.\n\"If you really need them, there's another gathering in nine days, so please come with your brothers then.”\nHer tone was so final that Hong Gae instinctively realized she wasn't someone who'd be swayed by more begging.\nIn the end, Hong Gae had no choice but to turn away with a disappointed expression.\nAfter leading his ogling beggars away from the cart, Hong Gae’s expression suddenly turned dead serious.\n‘That woman doesn’t seem to have learned martial arts.’\nWhile pretending to beg, Hong Gae had subtly flared his qi to see if she’d react. But the woman hadn’t even blinked.\n'It seems those three I found earlier are all the experts here.'\nHe had fallen for Il-mok's scheme, but he still hadn't dispelled his suspicions.\n“The real boss must be hiding somewhere.”\nHearing Hong Gae's words, the Three-Knot beggar who'd been stuffing snacks into his mouth like a hungry ghost asked, “Whaddaya meeb by dat?”\n“Swallow your food before you talk, you slob.”\nThe Three-Knot disciple quickly chewed what was in his mouth and said, “How is calling a beggar a beggar an insult?”\n“It’s an insult when you’re not supposed to be a beggar, you’re just acting like one, you idiot.”\nThe Three-Knot beggar knew Hong Gae's temperament and just accepted it. “Right. Anyway, boss, what’s this about a hidden leader?”\n“Think about it. These are the people who destroyed the Heavenly Orchid Society overnight. But I don’t see anyone here strong enough to kill their leader, or even their second-in-command.”\nThe other beggars nodded as if they’d just had a great epiphany.\n\"Ah.\"\nAll while continuing to shove food in their faces, of course.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 202 : Investigation (2)",
    "content": "Chapter 202: Investigation (2)\nThe day after the gathering ended.\nByuk, the eldest son of a fruit stand owner, who had been lured into attending the assembly by a beautiful woman and a young girl, was once again starting his day’s business with his father from early in the morning.\nThere was only one thing different from usual.\n\"I’ve got peaace~ liiike~ a river. I’ve got peaace~ liiike~ a river.\"\nHe couldn't stop humming that ridiculously catchy song from last night.\n“This kid hasn't shut up since last night. Peace? Peace my foot. Keep this up and our dinner table is gonna be anything but peaceful, you little punk.”\nByuk pouted. His dad was only in a bad mood because they hadn't gotten any customers yet.\n“Does being grumpy bring in customers, Dad? You gotta do business with peace in your heart so customers feel comfortable approaching you. You should try singing it too. It'll put your mind at ease. I’ve got peace li~ke a river.”\n“You little shit, where the hell did you go last night?”\nWhile the father looked at his son like he'd lost his mind, and the son ignored his father's glare to cheerfully belt out hymns.\nA passerby then entered the fruit shop.\n\"What's good today?\"\nFather and son both noticed the customer at the same time and immediately plastered on smiles.\n\"Welcome!\"\n“Everything’s fresh here! Feel free to look around and take your pick!”\nThe woman chuckled at the two of them, then looked over the fruit and pointed to some apples.\nThe father and son team quickly bagged them up for her. But as she paid and took the bag, she said something unexpected.\n\"Looks like you went to last night's gathering.\"\nHearing that, a huge grin spread across Byuk’s face.\n“Ah! Were you also there, miss?”\n\"Yes. I prefer 'We Shalll Fight Against the Wicked' over 'Peace Like a River' though. It just rolls off the tongue better, you know? Don't you just feel pumped up when you sing it?”\nAs the woman hummed quietly, Byuk grinned widely and joined in singing the chorus.\nThe woman gave a faint smile at Byuk’s enthusiasm and left the shop, while his father stared at his son with a bewildered expression.\n\"What in the world is going on here?\"\n\"Can't you see? This is what happens when you find inner peace, Dad.”\nAnd with that, Byuk started humming to himself again\nBut the father couldn't bring himself to scold his son after what had just happened.\nWas it because of that song?\nCustomers kept coming steadily after that, and some of them would recognize each other and sing along together.\nFaced with this utterly bizarre scene, the father eventually stood there with a dazed expression, watching his son's peculiar behaviour.\n\"Peace like a river flowing through me~\"\nHe even caught himself singing along without realizing it.\nAnd it wasn't just happening at the fruit stand. Similar scenes were playing out all over Lanzhou.\nThe red-light district had caught the fever too.\nActually, it was the worst there.\n\"Glo~ ry! Glory! O’ Divine Cult!!\"\n\"Peace like a river flowing through me~\"\nSince the Maitreya Luminous Cult had taken over the red-light district from the Heavenly Orchid Society, every brothel and tavern under the cult's jurisdiction had been required to attend the gathering.\nWhether they were attendants, courtesans, guards, or managers, after being force-fed with hymns all last night, the melodies just wouldn't leave their mouths.\nIt was even worse among the courtesans since some of them were skilled musicians who could play instruments.\nDing~\n“Hey, what if we tried playing this part like this?”\n“Sing it for me, and I’ll give it a try on my instrument.”\nThey'd work out the tunes on their instruments, and when a waiter or a bodyguard walked by and heard it, they'd start singing along. Before you knew it, the whole red-light district was one giant, nonstop hymn sing-along.\nBut while the hymns were echoing all over the place, something serious was going down on the top floor of the Crimson Silk Pavilion.\nThe old man who now managed several brothels in addition to the Crimson Silk Pavilion was meeting with a middle-aged woman.\n\"You wish to meet with the Incarnations of Maitreya?\"\nThe Pavilion Master sounded less than thrilled with her request.\n\"I said I would like to meet with those who have become the new masters of Lanzhou.\"\n\"Those people are the Incarnations of Maitreya.\"\n\"Then I would like to meet with them.\"\n\"They are not people who come when I call or go when I tell them to.\"\nWhen he shut her down, the woman looked troubled but pressed on.\n“Even if you can’t summon them, they still come to see you, don’t they? Couldn't you just… mention me to them next time they do?\" Thıs text ıs hosted at novelꜰire.net\n“You’re so desperate to meet them, yet you were the one who took advantage and stayed open for business all by yourself last night.\"\nThis was the main reason the Pavilion Master was in such a foul mood.\nIt was not out of absolute loyalty to the Maitreya Luminous Cult, nor was he trying to prevent her from meeting the Incarnations of Maitreya out of principle.\nIt was because last night, while all the brothels loyal to the cult were closed for the mandatory gathering, a few places—hers included—had stayed open and raked in all the cash.\nIt wasn't that they were rebelling. It was that the Maitreya Luminous Cult had intentionally left them alone.\nThese places had also paid tribute to the former Heavenly Orchid Society, but they had separate organizations backing them.\nThis was something the Demon Cult had figured out by combining old intel with new info they got from raiding the Heavenly Orchid Society. And that's why they had decided not to touch those establishments.\nAnd because they didn't belong to the Maitreya Luminous Cult, they'd done business among themselves last night and essentially monopolized all the customers who came to the red-light district.\n“We simply weren't invited, so we couldn't very well just show up. And it's not like we could just close up shop for no reason, could we?”\nThe owner of a brothel called the Red Blossom Pavilion offered her excuse.\nThe Pavilion Master scoffed.\n“Don’t play dumb with me. You didn't trust them yet, so you threw us out like bait. You watched to see if anything terrible would happen to us at that gathering, and now that we're fine, you're finally coming to request protection. Even a blind bastard can see that.\"\nCaught red-handed, the woman hesitated for a moment, then let out a sigh and spoke with a serious expression.\n“Let’s be honest. It sounded crazy, didn't it? A protection fee of only five percent? Plus, they were going to pay our girls and cancel their debts? Come on. Can you believe a crazy story like that when you first heard it?”\n\"...\"\nThe Red Blossom Pavilion Madam's gaze made him avert his eyes. The old man simply couldn’t lie and say yes to that.\nHe’d stayed alive this long by being careful and has seen all sorts of shit in his decades of life. He knew damn well that people offering such good conditions were most likely scammers.\nBut not anymore.\nNothing bad had happened at the gathering, and they'd even been paid extra for the effort of hauling carts and preparing late-night snacks.\n“You know I have a lot of people to look after, Pavilion Master. I simply couldn't move rashly. I just couldn’t afford to be reckless. Please, try to understand, for the sake of my girls.”\n\"Hmph.\"\nAs the Crimson Silk Pavilion Master snorted with displeasure and puffed tobacco smoke from his long pipe.\nThe Red Blossom Pavilion Madam added. \"I'm not saying this for free. I'll give you half the profits we earned doing business by ourselves last night.\"\nThe Crimson Silk Pavilion Master thought it over for a second. “I’ll pass your message along to the Incarnation of Maitreya. Whether it's acceptable or not will be decided by them. I'll let you know when there's a result.\"\nTrue to being a cautious old man, the Crimson Silk Pavilion Master did not act greedily.\nThe Red Blossom Pavilion and a few other establishments had made enormous profits last night when most brothels and pleasure houses were closed.\nInstead of pocketing half those profits himself, he intended to report to the Incarnations of Maitreya and pass it on to them.\nThe old man had survived this long in a harsh world, and he’d seen way too many people get themselves killed over a little bit of money.\nWhile talk of the Maitreya Luminous Cult spread through Lanzhou's four directions, a shouting match was breaking out in the shantytown under the bridge where the city's beggars lived.\n\"I'm truly disappointed in you, brothers!\"\n“Hey! Is this why you told us not to go there?”\nBeggars with grime dripping from them were venting their fury on other beggars, their eyes practically blazing.\n“W-We had no idea it would be like that!”\n“Yeah! We tried to get some for you guys, really! We’re all family, aren't we!\"\nThe beggars being interrogated didn't know what to do with themselves and kept averting their eyes.\n“Ahem. Look, this is all Hong Gae's fault! Go yell at him!”\nAnd just like that, the Three-Knot kid threw his boss under the bus.\nOnly then did the beggars turn their blazing eyes to search for Hong Gae who was hiding in the shack.\n\"Brother Hong Gae!\"\n“Boss! You can’t do this to us!”\nAs they began to look for him outside, Hong Gai exited the hut with his face bright red like his name.\n‘That damn… no-good beggar!’\nHong Gae was furious at his Three-Knot disciple for selling him out, but—\n\"Are you seriously trying to get mad at us right now?\"\n“We had a chance at a free meal, and now we’re starving because of you! How dare you glare at us!”\nBombarded by the angry beggars, Hong Gae could only hang his head in defeat.\nThey weren't members of the Beggar Gang like Hong Gae. They were ordinary beggars living in Lanzhou.\nAnd today, while they were out on the streets, they’d heard the one thing he didn’t want them to hear.\nThey’d heard that last night, the Maitreya Luminous Cult's gathering was giving out free food to everyone.\nAnd why didn't they go?\nBecause Hong Gae and his crew had warned them it was dangerous and told them not to go anywhere near it.\nBut from what they’d heard, the place wasn't dangerous at all. It was a fantastic place that gave out free food!\nNaturally, a nasty suspicion started to spread through the crowd.\n\"Tell us, Hong Gae! Did you do it on purpose? You did this on purpose, didn't you?! You were worried there wouldn't be enough food to go around, so you lied to keep it all for your gang!”\nThis ridiculous accusation made Hong Gai's head snap up with a reddened face.\n“That’s complete bullshit! I did it to protect you! I even asked those bastards for more food. I told them we needed to get portions for you too. Those stingy bastards wouldn't give it to us!\"\nHong Gae glared at the gang members as if demanding they back him up.\nSpooked by his terrifying stare, his men started talking fast.\n\"Hong Gae is telling the truth.\"\n\"Yes. They said they'd only give it to those who attended the gathering, and if anyone missed out, they could participate in the next gathering.\"\nThat explanation made the regular beggars’ eyes lit up.\n\"The next gathering?\"\n“There’s gonna be another one?”\n\"In nine days. No wait, since yesterday was nine days away, it'll be in eight days. Same place, same time.\"\nHearing the crew's explanation, the ordinary beggars glared at Hong Gae.\nThe eyes of beggars who'd missed out on free food were practically murderous.\n“You’re not gonna try and stop us this time, are you, boss?”\n\"Ahem. What choice do I have?\"\nRealizing there was no way he could keep them away from this cult now, Hong Gai sighed and hung his head low.\n‘Don’t tell me they had even calculated this?’\nWhile Hong Gae wondered if those bastards had plotted to turn even the beggars into believers...\n\"Oh, and if you want to participate in the gathering, you need to know the songs.\"\n\"Songs?\"\nSeeing that the ordinary beggars had calmed down a little, the gang members began teaching them about the hymns.\nThe younger beggars had already heard them so much that they knew them by heart.\n\"Try singing along. Peace like a river flowing through me~\"\n\"Peace like a river flowing through me~\"\nHis head was already spinning, and now, right next to him, they were singing the cult's anthem. Hong Gai just looked up at the sky.\n'The whole world has become the Maitreya Luminous Cult. And we’re all just living in it.’",

    "content": "Chapter 203: Investigation (3)\nA few days later.\n\"Haaahhhh...\"\nIl-mok stretched lazily as he woke from sleep.\n‘Man, this is the life.’\nBeing able to sleep when you wanted and wake when you pleased, now that was what he called a blessed life.\n\"I'll have them prepare washing water and your meal.\"\nAs soon as Il-mok stirred awake, Jin Hayeon's voice came from outside where she stood guard.\nShortly after, Jin Hayeon and Jeong Hyeon entered the room with each carrying a basin and a tray.\nAfter washing up and enjoying the meal they'd brought, Il-mok strolled out of his quarters with an unhurried gait.\nThe branch headquarters had a pretty lively atmosphere going on.\nThe branch members were each acting according to whatever cover identities they'd taken on. Dam Bin, on the other hand, was busy passing down various teachings to Seon-ah, Ouyang Mun, and Ju Seo-yeon.\nMeanwhile, Baek Cheon was either enthusiastically teaching the trio of women how to act or lost in some bizarre contemplation with the strangest expression on his face.\nRight now, word about the Maitreya Luminous Cult was spreading through Lanzhou in the shadows.\nYet for some reason, they weren't actually doing any missionary work.\nAnd it was all because of an order from Il-mok.\nThere were two main reasons for this.\nFirst, they'd figured out that Beggar Gang had kept an eye on them during the last gathering.\nHe had decided not to do anything conspicuous in order to avoid their eyes.\nHe had a few people on his team who stood out for their appearance alone. If they kept walking around the city trying to recruit people, it was only a matter of time before their disguise wore off.\nOf course, they couldn't just cancel the gatherings entirely, but at least they could buy some time.\nAnd according to the reports from the branch members operating in Lanzhou under their disguised identities, the atmosphere was such that missionary work was happening all on its own since the last assembly.\nThis was thanks to the power of the hymns and the late-night snacks.\nThis was yet another reason why Il-mok had ordered them to stop their activities.\n‘With our current numbers, controlling all of Lanzhou is impossible.’\nIf they gained any more believers, they'd risk losing control and causing problems instead.\nHe'd anticipated this, which was why Il-mok had sent a letter to headquarters before even launching the Lanzhou gathering.\nThe only problem was that the distance from Lanzhou to headquarters was so damn far that it would easily take another two weeks for reinforcements to arrive.\nAnd to buy that time, Il-mok had stopped the missionary work to avoid the Beggar Gang's gaze for even one more day.\nAs Il-mok stepped outside, Dam Bin, who'd been teaching, approached him.\n\"Did you sleep well, Young Master?\"\n\"You've been working hard, Squad Leader Dam Bin.\"\nIl-mok meant it.\nDam Bin was working nonstop morning and night. She'd secretly visited the red-light district to manage things there, took turns standing guard over Il-mok with the others, and taught her juniors whenever she had spare time.\nAnd on top of all that…\n\"Senior Hayeon!\"\n\"Hayeon!\"\nEven at this very moment, she had to deal with the stalker duo antics. The fact that Dam Bin could hammer lessons to these two was a miracle in itself.\n\"Big brother!\"\nOf course, Seon-ah was no different. It’s just that her target was someone else.\nUnderstanding the hidden meaning in Il-mok's praise, Dam Bin smiled enchantingly.\n‘The more I see her, the more mysterious she is.’\nThe bewitching aura Dam Bin had given off when using her martial arts the night they'd attacked the Heavenly Orchid Society, and the atmosphere she projected as an ordinary maid in daily life were completely different.\nHaving seen that other side of him, Il-mok still found it a little weird to look at her sometimes.\nAs Il-mok recalled that night's scene, Dam Bin spoke up.\n\"Young Master, there's actually something I need to tell you.\"\n\"Speak freely.\"\n\"The Red Blossom Pavilion's madam has requested a meeting with the Crimson Silk Pavilion Master.\"\n\"A meeting? With us?\"\n“Yes. To put it briefly, she wants to pay protection money so they can also come under our umbrella.\"\nIl-mok, who already knew exactly what other organization she worked for, took a moment to think.\nA moment later, Il-mok spoke.\n“Alright, let’s see what she has to say. Set up a meeting.”\nAs the sun went down, the streets of Lanzhou started to empty out as people headed home for the night.\nBut there is one street that was just getting started.\nWomen dressed in flowing clothes stepped out in front of shops to solicit customers, and people already flushed red with booze stumbled in even though night hadn't fully fallen yet.\nThis is the red-light district.\nOn the top floor of a pleasure house called the Crimson Silk Pavilion, located in the heart of that street of indulgence, sat a middle-aged woman and an old man.\nThe Madam of Red Blossom Pavilion and Crimson Silk Pavilion Master.\nAppetizing-looking food and alcohol sat on the table between them, but neither woman nor man looked at the food or drink.\nTheir expressions were tense instead.\nBefore long, the person they were waiting for arrived with a barely audible sound.\nSwoosh.\nThe window slid open as if on its own, and a dark figure filled their view with the red glimmer of sunset shining on him.\nThe man wore black robes and a wrathful Buddha mask, making it impossible to discern his appearance or age.\nAs if testing them, the man looked down at the Red Flower Pavilion Madam and the Crimson Silk Pavilion Master before finally stepping down to the floor and approaching the table where they sat.\nThump.\nOnly then did the two people hurriedly rise to their feet and pay their respects to the man.\nAfter watching them for a moment, the man spoke.\n\"I'll speak with the Red Blossom Pavilion Madam alone; you may leave.\"\n\"As you command.\"\nThe Crimson Silk Pavilion Master bowed again and carefully left the room, and a heavy silence descended over the room with just the two of them remaining.\nNo.\nIt was a silence that felt heavy only to the Madam of the Red Blossom Pavilion. Dıscover more novels at novelꜰire.net\nThe man in the wrathful Buddha mask sat down in a chair with a carefree gait.\n\"Sit comfortably.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nThe Red Blossom Pavilion Madam sat with proper etiquette, then carefully poured wine into Il-mok's cup as if serving an elder.\nAs she began pouring wine into her own cup, the man spoke.\n\"I hear you wanted to meet with us?\"\n\"That's correct, O’ Incarnation of Maitreya.\"\n\"Why?\"\nAt that sharp question, the Red Blossom Pavilion Madam answered carefully.\n\"Like the Crimson Silk Pavilion, we too wish to receive the Maitreya Luminous Cult's protection.\"\n\"Protection?\"\nAs if the word itself was foreign to him, the masked man spoke in a peculiar tone before asking again.\n\"Why exactly would you need our protection?\"\n\"...Though the Heavenly Orchid Society has disappeared thanks to you, human greed is a terrifying thing. Even if they don't dare oppose the Incarnation of Maitreya, ruffians who realize we're not under the Maitreya Luminous Cult's jurisdiction will surely appear, which is why we also wish to receive the Maitreya Luminous Cult's protection.\"\nDespite her lengthy answer, the masked man somehow just stared at her in silence.\nThe blank look in his eyes was so unnerving that she had to swallow hard before she quickly added.\n“Of course, we’re prepared to show our goodwill. We’ll give you half of everything we made the other night when all the other places were closed. And from now on, we’ll pay you a cut of our profits, same as everyone else.”\nWhen she finished speaking, a smile appeared on the man's lips.\nBut that smile only made the Red Blossom Pavilion Madam feel a chill run down her spine.\nIt wasn't a smile of satisfaction.\nIt was closer to a sneer.\n‘Was the money not enough?’\nBefore she could open her mouth to offer more generous terms—\n“I see you didn’t understand my question.”\nThe masked man's mouth opened first.\n\"Or are you looking down on us?\"\nHe wasn't even flaring his aura, but the Red Blossom Pavilion Madam felt like a herbivore placed before a predator.\nCold sweat was pouring down her back, but she managed to force a smile. \"This foolish woman doesn't understand what you mean.\"\n“Then I shall grant you my mercy and ask one more time. Why do you need our protection? You, who belong to the Hao Clan.\"\n\"......\"\nThe Red Blossom Pavilion Madam's cold sweat had already spread beyond her back and begun trickling down her forehead toward her face.\nThe Hao Clan.\nUsing the characters below (下) and filthy (汚), it was a group formed by people living at rock bottom. In some ways, it was similar to the Beggar Gang, but unlike the Beggar Gang, they could never be treated as part of the Orthodox Faction.\nAnd for good reason. The Beggar Gang had been created during wartime to help those who'd become beggars. But the Hao Clan was an organization formed when people wallowing in the mud banded together to survive on their own.\nAnd they'd employed various schemes to survive.\nUnlike beggars who lived on alms, they'd practiced pickpocketing and many other things.\nThe children were forced to make money or beg, the women would sell themselves to men and make them drunk with alcohol to rob them blind while the men slept. Not only that, the women often inflate their target bills, hence plunging them into debt.\nThat said, they usually drew the line from serious crimes like human trafficking, drugs, murder, or robbery.\nIt wasn't that they had morals. They were just smart enough not to pick fights with people who could crush them.\nAnd similar to the Beggar Gang, they also made money selling information gathered from operating taverns and brothels throughout the Central Plains.\nAs the masked man said, she belonged to the Hao Clan. More than just belonging, she could be called the Branch Leader of the Lanzhou Hao Clan branch.\nAs befitting a Hao Clan branch master, she tried to keep her cool, even though her heart was hammering against her ribs.\nShe had already considered that they might know who she was.\nAfter all, when the Maitreya Luminous Cult had taken over the red-light district, they had deliberately skipped over her businesses.\nThat alone made it highly likely they knew who they really were.\n\"Though we belong to the Hao Clan, the Central Plains is so vast that we are mostly on our own out here. We can only receive help when misfortune strikes. And by then, it’s too late to bring back the dead.\"\nEven as cold sweat trickled down her forehead, the Red Blossom Pavilion Madam forced a smile as she gave a lengthy answer.\n\"For the same reason, we'd been paying protection money to the Heavenly Orchid Society while living in Lanzhou.\"\nHearing her very believable excuse, the masked man’s smile grew even wider.\n“Let's be honest. You don’t want our protection. You want our information, don't you?\"\n\"......\"\nShe was so thoroughly struck on the mark that for a moment, she was at a loss for words.\nShe'd succeeded in fooling even the shrewd Crimson Silk Pavilion Master, but she felt like her innermost thoughts were being read completely under that indifferent gaze.\nAs she stood there, completely frozen, the masked man continued.\n\"The reason I came here today was to give you a warning.\"\n\"......\"\n\"If you don't want to see your underlings slaughtered because of your useless greed, I suggest you learn some self-control. Immediately.”\nAs the Red Blossom Pavilion Madam stared at him with a tense face—\n“Our cult’s primary rule is that we don’t harm innocent people.”\nHe said it in a completely flat voice.\n“But I have to wonder… are any of you in the Hao Clan truly innocent?\"\nAnd with that, a tsunami of killing intent that didn't match his indifferent expression pressed down on the Red Blossom Pavilion Madam.",

    "content": "Chapter 204: A Day Without Work is a Day Without Food (1)\nHeavenly Demon Divine Cult, Lanzhou Branch.\nAs they returned to the estate, Dam Bin couldn't hide the pleased expression on her face as she spoke.\n\"That was truly an excellent decision befitting our doctrine, Young Master.\"\n\"...I just didn't want unnecessary bloodshed.\"\nIt wasn't the blood of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult he was referring to. The elites of the Hao Clan might pose some challenge to them, but the rest were just cannon fodder. The Lanzhou branch could have been slaughtered without any losses on their side.\n\"I wouldn't call it unnecessary. After all, every single member of the Hao Clan is a scumbag, aren't they?\"\nIl-mok shook his head at Dam Bin's comment.\n“Sure, but they aren't exactly scum on the level of the Red Serpent Gang or the Heavenly Orchid Society.”\nThey were criminals, yes, but not utterly depraved villains. At most, they were just a gathering of petty criminals.\nBut they were a far cry from the Beggar Gang.\nIf most of the beggars in the Beggar Gang were innocent and pitiful folk, these guys were criminals through and through.\nWhile he would have felt uneasy killing members of the Beggar Gang just because they got in his way, the Hao Clan members were the type where there was no real reason not to kill them if they became troublesome.\nThat's why Il-mok had gone out of his way to visit the Red Blossom Pavilion Madam to give her a warning.\n'I can't just go around on a killing spree just because I could.'\nIt wasn't because he felt squeamish about murder.\nIl-mok slightly lowered his head to look at the sword tied to his waist.\n‘...Something just feels... off.’\nIt was discomfort with himself, with the fact that he felt no guilt about killing.\nThere was a nagging fear in the back of his mind that if he started killing whomever he wanted just because he could, he'd eventually cross a line and wouldn't be able to come back.\nSeveral days had passed since his meeting with the Red Blossom Pavilion Madam.\nIt seemed the woman had not ignored the warning, as no Hao Clan’s rats were caught sniffing around the cult’s area.\nIn the meantime, Dam Bin and Jin Hayeon kept up the training for the new recruits of the Hidden Guard Pavilion, and Baek Cheon was having a grand time harassing the three rookie actors.\nAnd so, on the evening nine days after the last gathering...\nPeople gathered once again at the same location where the previous assembly had been held.\nWatching the situation unfold from that same tree as before, Il-mok let out a hollow laugh.\n‘We didn’t even try to recruit anyone, but more people showed up.’\nThe catchy hymns and midnight snacks seemed to have worked a bit too well.\nNot to mention how addictive those hymns were.\n‘And look at how many of these beggar bastards have shown up.’\nThe number of beggars who came to the gathering site had easily quadrupled.\nWhat's more, all the new beggars were ones who hadn't learned any martial arts.\nAs you'd expect, the crowd split itself into three main cliques.\nYou had the folks from the brothels and taverns. Then the regular townsfolk. And finally, the beggars.\nWhile the beggars had mingled with the regular folks at the first gathering, they were now completely segregated.\nThis was due to the horrendous stench emanating from them.\nWhen their numbers were small it was tolerable, but now that they'd come in droves, people started avoiding them.\nNaturally, the beggars huddled together with other beggars, and the mass of beggars gathered in one place gave off a horrendous stench.\nAs a result, Il-mok's alter ego was about to have a fit.\n- Slaughter those filthy animals!!\nThe last time, he'd been far enough away, and there weren't that many of them, so he could handle it.\nBut they were now packed together in a huge crowd, and he could smell the stink all the way from his tree.\nBut now they were gathered in a mass, so even from a distance, he could smell them.\n'Crazy bastard. Killing them just because they're dirty is too much.'\nThough Il-mok cursed inwardly at the side effects of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword, he couldn't endure it any longer.\nPat.\nIl-mok equipped the wrathful Buddha mask just in case and descended from the tree.\nHe gathered his internal energy but didn’t draw his sword nor did he channel his energy according to the principles of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword.\nInstead, his internal energy began resonating with the energy of the world around him.\n\"You scoundrel!\"\n\"So you finally show your true colors!\"\nThe moment a few beggars belatedly sensed the mighty flow of energy and shouted in alarm—\nKwaaaaah!!\nA torrent of water flew toward the huddled mass of beggars.\nEvery beggar—except for a middle-aged guy who looked like their boss—was completely soaked like drowned rats.\nTheir miserable state somehow got even more pathetic, and the local boss of the Beggar Gang—who had hastily leaped away thinking it was a surprise attack—just stared at the watery scene with the weirdest look on his face.\nWhile the beggars were too confused by the sudden situation to gather their wits, Il-mok gave his orders.\n\"Bring the lye soap left at the washing area and scrub their bodies clean.\"\nHis plan all along was just to bath them.\nIt was the only thing his last bit of sanity could come up with to keep himself from slaughtering them all.\nThis whole plan was only possible because they were next to the washing area, which was overflowing with water qi. His super-sized internal energy from the elixir was just the icing on the cake.\nA few people scrambled to obey Il-mok's order, grabbing the stone tubs and starting to scrub down the resisting beggars.\nThroughout all this, Il-mok remained standing where he'd shot the water stream, watching the situation unfold.\nHe couldn't bring himself to wash them directly. If he got any closer, he felt like he'd really go berserk.\nThen, the Beggar Gang local leader who had alone dodged the water stream, let out an enraged shout.\n\"What the fuck are you doing?!\"\nHearing Hong Gae’s furious shout, Il-mok also shot back with veins on his forehead.\n“What am I doing? I’m washing you, you filthy rats!”\n“Are you seriously telling me you don’t get that you’re starving them to death?!”\n\"......?\"\nAs Il-mok and everyone else just stared in confusion, the others started chiming in.\n\"That's right!\"\n\"Please, stop this!\"\n\"Oh, this is killing me!!\"\nThe beggars getting the forced scrub-down began groaning in protest.\nAnd thanks to one washed beggar's wailing, Il-mok was able to grasp the situation.\n\"If we become this clean, how can we beg for alms?\"\nEven though he was one second away from completely snapping, Il-mok almost let out a hollow laugh despite himself.\n‘I see now, these sons of bitches. It’s not that they couldn’t wash. They just refused to!’\nCome to think of it, there is a big fucking river right over there, so how the fuck can they not wash?\nIt’s obvious.\nThey had to live without washing because people only gave them money when they looked pitiful and dirty.\n‘Honestly. A big part of me wants to just kill them all.’\nTheir sheer nerve, their disgusting filth that set off his obsession, and the way they kept annoyingly trying to dig up dirt on his people.\nThere wasn't a single thing he liked about them.\n—That's right! Kill them! They should be grateful that you’ll carve the perfect sword paths on their filthy bodies!\nIronically, the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword’s egging on him instead made him pause and rethink what he should do.\nAfter a very brief moment of pondering what to do with those damn bastards, Il-mok came up with a useful idea.\nAnd it was all thanks to what the beggars themselves had said.\n“You wretched fools! There’s an old saying that goes: 'Those who do not work shall not eat!' You're so lazy, you're worse than livestock!\"\nThe crowd started to buzz at Il-mok’s declaration.\n(TL Note: Lol, the audacity.)\n\"Was there such an old saying...?\"\n“That’s the first I’ve ever heard of it...”\nWhile everyone muttered in puzzled tones, one middle-aged man dressed as a scholar clicked his tongue and spoke.\n\"Tsk tsk. This is why people need to read books. It's an old tale from a monk named Master Huaihai during the Tang Dynasty! He said that on any day he didn't work, he wouldn't eat either! A day without work is a day without food (一日不作 一日不食)! Isn't that clearly what that masked man is talking about?”\nHearing the scholar, Il-mok breathed an inward sigh of relief.\n'Damn. I didn't know this saying didn't exist in the Central Plains either.'\nThank god there was a similar story he could piggyback on.\nMeanwhile, thanks to Il-mok's scolding and the scholar's backup, all eyes turned back to the beggars.\nBut it wasn't the usual look of pity. Now, they were looking at the beggars like they were pathetic trash.\nIt made perfect sense, really.\nThese guys won’t wash themselves for the sake of handouts. For regular folks who had to slave away at their jobs every day, that was just insulting.\n“And to think I actually gave food to those kinds of people.”\n“Hah. They’re not beggars, they’re con artists.”\nAs accusations poured from the crowd, the beggars who had cast aside their pride to survive on alms had no choice but to lower their heads in shame.\nOne beggar couldn't take the humiliation anymore and screamed. “You think we want to live like this?!”\nThe moment that beggar's outcry burst forth. Hong Gae instinctively sensed something was going wrong.\nIn a night where the only source of light was the gentle moonlight, Hong Gae’s eyes caught something.\nThe man who’d turned the crowd on them, that sorcerer bastard who’d blasted them with water, he was smiling. ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ novel⸺fire.net\n\"Then why are you lot living like that when your limbs are perfectly fine?\"\nFrom the very beginning, Il-mok had no intention of merely shaming the beggars and chasing them away.\n\"We live as beggars because there's no work! No one will give us jobs!!\"\nHearing that desperate shout, Il-mok wiped the smile off his face and asked with a serious voice.\nThis was the method Il-mok had devised to eliminate the beggars from Lanzhou without killing them.\n“Alright then. If we give you guys jobs and pay you for it, will you stop begging?”\nIt was to give them work and pay them wages.\nIt was a solution that came to him instantly because he had worked as a social welfare civil servant.\nDon't just give them a fish; teach them how to fish.\nIn the welfare-related work Il-mok had done, this was the most obvious and most important principle.\nThe problem was that it was a principle difficult to implement due to practical reasons.\n'But thanks to the Heavenly Orchid Society's wealth, I have more than enough money to give them work.'\nBut right here, right now, it was a perfectly feasible method.\nEspecially in a situation like this, where countless people's disdainful gazes were focused on the beggars.\nIf any beggar was dumb enough to say, ‘Nah, I’d rather keep begging than work!’ he wouldn't just be a beggar anymore—he'd be a lunatic.\n\"Y-you'll give us work and wages?\"\n\"I-is this really true, sir?\"\nAs the beggars suddenly used extreme honorifics with Il-mok, Hong Gae finally came to his senses and shouted. “Don’t fall for his honeyed words! What makes you think you can trust anything these people say?!”\nSince his shout was laced with internal energy, everyone's gazes naturally turned to Hong Gae.\n\"I am Hong Gae, a Five-Knot Beggar of the Beggar Gang and the Branch Leader in charge of Lanzhou. Following the will of our Founding Ancestor, I will do anything to protect beggars!\"\nHong Gae went so far as to reveal his identity while declaring war against the Maitreya Luminous Cult.\n“That’s a strange thing to say.”\nBut the masked sorcerer just tilted his head, as if he was genuinely confused, and asked a question.\n“One side offers them jobs and pay. The other just lets them keep begging and maybe stops them from getting kicked around a few times. So tell me, which one is really helping the beggars?”\nThe sorcerer's tone was calm.\n\"......\"\nBut he hit Hong Gae with a question that Hong Gae had never considered in his life and couldn’t answer.",

    "content": "Chapter 205: A Day Without Work is a Day Without Food (2)\nRight after Hong Gae shut his mouth, Il-mok turned to address the beggars.\n\"From now on, those who wish to follow the doctrines of our Maitreya Luminous Cult and earn wages through honest work should head over to those stone basins and wash yourselves. As for those who don't. Leave. Now.\"\nIl-mok's declaration sparked some resistance among the beggars.\n“W-Wait, you just gave us free food last time!”\n“Changing your tune like this? You’ve definitely got something up your sleeves!”\nBut their protests didn't amount to much.\n\"The Maitreya Luminous Cult exists to punish the wicked and save the common people. So, let me ask you this: when you're given the opportunity to work but refuse and choose to just keep begging for handouts, does that make you a good person? Or does it make you wicked?”\nThe ones who answered Il-mok's question weren't the beggars.\n\"They're wicked!!\"\n\"Those shameless bastards!\"\nThe crowd, realizing that these beggars were refusing to even wash themselves for alms, turned on them with condemnation.\nThe beggars were officially stuck between a rock and a hard place.\nMost of them started glancing nervously at Hong Gae and the martial artist beggars—members of the Beggar Gang. They were checking to see what their leader would do.\n\"I-I'll work!\"\n\"I want to try living like a proper human being, sir!\"\nBut a few beggars squeezed their eyes shut, turned their backs on Hong Gae and grabbed the cleaning stones.\n\"Boss!\"\nSome of the Beggar Gang disciples urgently called out to Hong Gae when they saw their people abandoning them, but he just shook his head with a face as dark as if a demon had possessed him.\n\"...Let's go. We're leaving.\"\nIn the end, the beggars split into two groups—those who left following Hong Gae, and those who stayed behind to wash themselves.\nEven those who left weren't doing so because they hated work.\nIt was because of their faith in Hong Gae, who had protected them all this time. More precisely, they were thinking that maybe these people really were suspicious, just like Hong Gae had said.\nThe second they were gone, Il-mok gave the order.\n\"Begin the gathering!\"\nThe moment Il-mok's command fell, the Branch Leader stepped forward and began his sermon.\nYou’d think the argument would have killed the mood, but the crowd was more fired up than ever.\nThe crowd had been deeply moved by the way Il-mok had disciplined the beggars.\nWhile everyone's attention was focused on the Branch Leader's sermon, Il-mok used his stealth technique to quickly return to his original hiding spot.\n—That was truly a moving teaching, Young Master, one that showed how deeply you have contemplated the doctrine of our Divine Cult. I was able to reflect on my own shallow understanding of our teachings. I can only express my gratitude again and again.\nWhen Il-mok returned to the tree, he received a voice transmission message from Dam Bin, who had been hiding elsewhere to observe the situation.\nOn top of that, Hyeokryeon Seon-ah—who had remained in the tree following Il-mok's instructions—was giving him a look he recognized all too well.\nHow should he put it?\nIt was the exact same look the fanatics in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult get on their faces when they meet the Heavenly Demon himself.\nMeanwhile, the Branch Leader's brief sermon came to an end, and Baek Cheon stepped forward with three women.\nInstantly, the vibe of the crowd shifted.\nEveryone who’d been here last time knew what was coming. They sensed it was hymn time.\n\"W-wait just a moment!\"\nJust then, some members from the brothels and taverns raised their hands and called out.\n“We have prepared a musical performance over the past nine days! If it is not too much trouble, would it be alright for us to join in?”\nBaek Cheon burst into hearty laughter.\n\"Hahaha! Your devotion to Maitreya is truly admirable! Of course you may join us!\"\nFollowing Baek Cheon's answer, the courtesans began to take out the instruments they'd brought with them.\nWatching this, Baek Cheon asked. \"We'll start with something powerful—'We Shall Fight Against the Wicked!' Are you ready?\"\nThe courtesans gave an energetic yes and then gave each other a look.\nRight after they all nodded, a rich harmony of different instruments filled the air.\nBaek Cheon savored the melody with a face of pure bliss before beginning to sing the hymn at just the right moment.\n“He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat; He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat…”\nThose who had attended the previous gathering immediately began singing along with Baek Cheon from the very beginning.\n“Glo~ ry! Glory! O’ Divine Cult!!”\n“Glo~ ry! Glory! O’ Divine Cult!!”\nEven those who hadn't memorized the song yet sang the chorus at the top of their lungs without missing a beat.\nMeanwhile...\nA woman hiding in a different location from Il-mok, watching the gathering. Dam Bin was observing the scene with eyes filled with turbulent emotion.\n'Ahhh. If only the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons could have witnessed this moment.'\nThe supreme being she served, the true identity of the Maitreya these people were desperately seeking—she only regretted that she couldn't show him this scene of people worshipping the Heavenly Demon.\nMore than anything else...\n‘Just as the Supreme One said, the Eighth Young Master is without a doubt the great talent who will guide our Divine Cult to greater heights!'\nThe profound stratagems of the Eighth Young Master, who had orchestrated this entire affair, were simply too wondrous.\nAfter several rounds of sermons and hymns had passed...\n“It’s getting late, and everyone must be hungry. Please help yourselves to the late-night snack we’ve prepared.”\nIt was finally time for the food—the same food the beggars who remained had been waiting for.\nAs everyone was enjoying the food and chatting in little groups, Jin Hayeon walked over to the beggars who were ravenously devouring their food.\n\"After you finish your snacks, follow me.\"\nAt the cold beauty's words, the beggars either stared at her with dazed expressions or hung their heads in embarrassment.\nThey felt that she was so far out of their league that the thought of talking to her was unimaginable.\nBut regardless of their reactions, her expression remained as indifferent as ever.\nWhen they looked like they were done eating, she led them somewhere.\nSurprisingly, the place she headed to was none other than the empty estate of the Heavenly Orchid Society.\nThat night, they'd burned all the corpses to eliminate evidence and covered up all the traces of Demonic Arts throughout the estate, but they hadn't been able to remove all the bloodstains scattered here and there completely.\nJin Hayeon guided them to a hall that had relatively little blood remaining.\n“It’s late, so you can stay here for the night. Starting tomorrow, the first task you'll be doing is cleaning this estate.\"\nAfter delivering all the necessary information to those who were no longer beggars, she disappeared into the darkness.\nOnce she was gone, the beggars looked at each other nervously.\n\"W-we made the right choice, right?\"\n“Ahem. I think so. They gave us food and a roof over our heads.”\n“Yeah, a roof where a bunch of people were just slaughtered a few days ago.”\nWhile the former beggars were trying to calm their nerves, Jin Hayeon used her stealth skills to get back to the branch headquarters without a trace.\n\"I've guided the workers to the Heavenly Orchid Society's estate, Young Master.\"\n\"Thank you for your hard work, Miss Jin.\"\n“Young Master… if it’s not too much trouble, may I ask a question?”\nIl-mok noticed that her tone was even more worshipful than usual, which he found a little weird.\n“Go ahead.”\n“Do you mind if I ask what the plan is for them?”\nShe hadn't heard the full details either.\nShe’d just gotten a quick voice transmission message from Il-mok telling her where to take them and what to say.\nIl-mok just shrugged like it was no big deal.\n“Reinforcements from the main headquarters should be here in about two weeks, correct? I figure we can use these guys to get the place ready for them. On top of that, I’m planning to launch a few businesses here.”\nIl-mok told her about several things he was planning.\nAnd after hearing all of this, Jin Hayeon responded with her usual calm expression, but...\n“I never would have dreamed you’d planned all this out in such a short amount of time.”\nThere was a very faint tremor in her eyes.\nFor someone whose Demonic Art was all about suppressing her emotions, that tiny twitch was the equivalent of a full-blown meltdown.\n'...I can never tell if she's being sarcastic or sincere.'\nFrom Il-mok's perspective, she just looked completely expressionless as always.\n\"I just got lucky, that's all.\"\nEven Il-mok himself thought he was far from being called a \"genius.\"\nLooking at how he'd passed the Rank 7 civil service exam in his past life, he wasn't stupid, but he was nowhere near the word \"genius.\"\nStill, having passed the Rank 7 exam, he figured he could at least be considered bright.\nThe reason he could come up with various plans so quickly was simple.\nWhile he was only eighteen as Il-mok, he had the experience of living as an adult in society from when he was Seo Ji-hoon.\n'And I had the good luck of learning this damn Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword. Fucking hell.'\nOn top of that, the side effect of his Demonic Art had created a habit of calculating dozens of possibilities for any situation.\nEarly the next morning...\n“Get up, you lazy bum!”\nThe owner of a fruit shop yelled at his son, Byuk.\n\"What the hell? Did you eat something bad after coming back from that gathering yesterday?\"\nStill half-asleep, Byuk threw back the same words his father had said to him a few days ago.\nIt turned out they had both gone to the gathering last night. What had initially seemed like his son's eccentric behavior began to make sense when customers who frequented the fruit shop started saying similar things or singing the same songs.\nNow, the father’s eyes were blazing with conviction.\n“Tch. Is that all you went for? To chase girls? Shame on you.”\nHaving said that, his father suddenly unfurled a large piece of paper.\n\"Remember what the Incarnation of Maitreya said! From today on, this phrase will become our family motto!\"\nWritten on it were the words: [A Day Without Work is a Day Without Food].\nAs a father who had worked at the fruit shop for decades and built a household, he had been deeply moved by the sight of the Incarnation of Maitreya disciplining the beggars.\nHe'd even paid some middle-aged scholar to write out this phrase on paper before returning home. Content orıginally comes from novel⚑fire.net\n\"Come on, let's go!\"\nWith those words, his father headed to the fruit shop with his still-drowsy son.\n\"I’ve got peaace~ liiike~ a river. I’ve got peaace~ liiike~ a river.\"\nHumming that addictively catchy hymn was just a bonus.\nByuk had been annoyed about being dragged out of bed so early.\n\"I’ve got peaace~ liiike~ a river. I’ve got peaace~ liiike~ a river.\"\nBefore he knew it, he was humming the hymn along with his father as they started their work.\n'When the Heavenly Orchid Society was around, life felt so threatening.'\n'Now all we need to do is work hard.'\nAnd for the first time in a long time, the sky looked bright and clear.\nAt the Heavenly Orchid Society's estate...\nThe men who used to be beggars were now hard at work, carrying materials, tearing down buildings, and patching up broken walls, all under someone's direction.\nThe man giving them orders was a carpenter hired by the Maitreya Luminous Cult.\nNot just any carpenter doing odd jobs either, but a master craftsman capable of designing houses and estates.\n'I have my doubts that a bunch of former beggars can do this right, but the pay is good, so I’ll give it a shot.'\nHe was giving instructions while looking at the former beggars carrying and organizing materials with a skeptical eye.\nHonestly, he was skeptical about the cult just as much.\nThey’d shown up out of nowhere, wiped out the Heavenly Orchid Society, and were making a name for themselves through Lanzhou. Of course, he suspected they had ulterior motives.\nBut that wasn't the main issue.\n'They want me to knock down the main buildings and put up one giant hall. Are they planning to build an indoor training ground or something? And on top of that, a school and a medical clinic? What the hell are these people even doing?'\nHe looked down at the blueprint request from the Maitreya Luminous Cult with a deeply confused expression.",

    "content": "Chapter 206: A Day Without Work is a Day Without Food (3)\nAround the time when construction was in full swing at the place that was once the estate of the Heavenly Orchid Society...\nThe guy who came up with the whole \"A Day Without Work is a Day Without Food \" was sleeping like a log. He finally dragged himself out of bed late in the morning, feeling refreshed.\n\"Haaaah~!\"\nAs he let out a satisfying yawn and stretched, a cheerful greeting came from beyond the door.\nThe voice of one like Dam Bin or Jin Hayeon, who always welcomed him.—\n“YOUNG MASTER! YOU’RE FINALLY AWAKE!!”\n—were nowhere to be heard.\nInstead, it was that attention-seeking lunatic shouting his head off.\nIl-mok's good mood evaporated the moment he woke up. He sighed and responded.\n“What’s wrong with you this early in the morning?”\nIl-mok was starting to think that guy needed some serious counseling.\n'Ugh. Talking about counseling reminds me of that other lunatic…'\nThe thought brought back memories of a certain mad scientist from the Hall of the Demonic Way who'd insisted on following him.\nThank god he'd managed to escape to the Central Plains before that bastard could chase after him.\nWhile Il-mok was briefly lost in thoughts about that crazy physician, Baek Cheon entered the room along with Ouyang Mun and Hyeokryeon Seon-ah, who'd been standing guard.\n\"Young Master! Actually, I have a favor to ask!\"\n\"A favor?\"\nIl-mok had a bad feeling about this.\nA request from a lunatic was bound to be something insane.\nBut before Il-mok could even think of a way to say no, Baek Cheon started gushing.\n“Last night, when we sang the hymns with the musicians… it was a revelation! I realized it’s the perfect way to spread the teachings of the Divine Cult, Young Master! So, I was thinking… could we maybe practice with them, even when we’re not holding a gathering?”\nBaek Cheon's expression grew ecstatic as he recalled the previous night.\nThat glorious scene of everyone singing along to his hymns while the courtesans played their instruments.\nEven now, just thinking about that euphoric moment made his body tremble with excitement.\nWatching Baek Cheon shake and shiver with that deranged look in his eyes, Il-mok felt his skin crawl.\n'Ugh.'\nBut setting aside how disgusting Baek Cheon was, his request was actually pretty useful.\n\"Is Dam Bin or Miss Jin awake?\"\n\"Yes, big brother.\"\n\"They're outside right now, teaching Miss Jeong and Miss Ju.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nIl-mok seemed to ponder for just a moment before giving his orders.\n\"Leave the training to Dam Bin and bring Miss Jin here.\"\n\"Right away, Young Master!\" Follow current novels on novel-fire.ɴet\nOuyang Mun practically skipped out of the hall with a huge smile on her face.\nA moment later, Ouyang Mun and Jin Hayeon returned with their expressions a perfect contrast to each other.\n\"Miss Jin. I need you to make a quick trip to the red-light district.\"\nIt was an instruction ripe for misunderstanding, but Jin Hayeon asked with an indifferent expression.\n\"What orders should I relay there?\"\n\"Young Master Baek Cheon wants to practice hymns with the courtesans. Ask them to cooperate. Do not drag them here against their will.”\nIf the courtesans of the red-light district had been fanatics of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, there would have been no need to use the word ‘cooperation.’\nHe could just snap his fingers, and they'd all be lining up, eyes gleaming with madness, screaming, “I’ll do anything for the Heavenly Demon!”\nBut they weren’t at that stage yet. For now, he had to be careful.\n“Also, while you're there, hire some cooks and have them make some food.”\n\"Food for the workers at the construction site?\"\n\"Correct. The estate’s huge, so there’s plenty of space that's not being worked on. They can use a spot like that for the rehearsal.”\n\"Then I'll also have them prepare food for Young Master Baek Cheon and the courtesans, and I'll bring money in advance to distribute to the workers.\"\nWhen Il-mok nodded at Jin Hayeon's words, she clasped her fists and left the hall.\nAt the estate, the former beggars and the construction crew were sweating buckets.\nSuddenly, a group of about a dozen people showed up.\nOne masked woman, one man with unnervingly clear eyes, ten other women.\nAll the women except the masked one were carrying trays loaded with food.\n“Please take a short break and have some refreshments.”\nWhen one of the women said this with a smile, the master carpenter overseeing the construction, Deok Gwang, nodded and shouted.\n\"Everyone, take a half-hour break!\"\nThe moment his order fell, the former beggars and workers gathered around and began eating the food the women had brought.\nWatching this scene, the woman in the wrathful deity mask spoke in an indifferent tone.\n\"Let's go.\"\nAs soon as her instruction dropped, the clear-eyed man and the ten women followed her, but...\nOddly enough, they were heading toward the interior of the estate.\n“Hey, where are you headed?” Deok Gwang asked.\nThe masked woman stopped and turned. “We’re going to rehearse in an area that isn't being worked on.”\n“Rehearse?”\nDeok Gwang stroked his scratchy beard for a second, then just shrugged and turned away.\nAs long as they didn't interfere with the construction, he couldn't care less.\n“Guess they’re going to sing for us while we work,” he muttered to himself.\nIgnoring the carpenter’s muttering, the masked woman led her group to a different part of the estate.\n\"This spot should work well for your rehearsal.”\nAt the masked woman's words, the performance began under Baek Cheon's direction.\n\"Let's start with Siloam.\"\nThe woman who had brought them—Jin Hayeon—stepped back and watched with her usual blank expression.\nHer job was to keep an eye on things.\nYou might think it was to make sure the courtesans didn’t try anything funny, like spying or passing messages.\nBut you’d be wrong.\n—Young Master Baek Cheon is a lunatic who could go off the rails at any moment, so Miss Jin, please keep watch and stop him if needed.\nIt was actually because of a secret message Il-mok had sent while giving his instructions, without Baek Cheon knowing.\nAnd there was one more thing Il-mok had instructed.\nAfter Baek Cheon and the ten women had been practicing for quite a while...\nAround the point when one hour had passed, Jin Hayeon, who had been watching the practice with an impassive face, opened her mouth.\n\"Let's take a fifteen-minute break.\"\nBaek Cheon immediately objected to her instruction.\n“A break? But we’re nowhere near good enough yet! What are you talking about?”\n\"Unlike you, Young Master Baek, these women haven't trained in martial arts. You need to think about their physical limits.”\nThis was another one of Il-mok’s secret orders for Jin Hayeon. He’d known that if left to his own devices, the lunatic would get so caught up in the practice that he’d work the musicians until they literally collapsed.\n—Also, you might strain your voice, Young Master, so wet your throat with some water. Young Master Il-mok sent word that he's concerned your precious vocal cords, the very instrument needed to spread the word of our cult, might get damaged.\nOn top of that, Il-mok hadn't forgotten to advise her on exactly how to phrase things so Baek Cheon would listen.\n—As expected, Eighth Young Master is even thinking about my precious vocal cords! This Baek is deeply, deeply moved!\nJin Hayeon just gave a slight, tired shake of her head.\n\"Ahem. Everyone, take a fifteen-minute break!\"\nIn a much better mood, Baek Cheon gave the order and began wetting his throat with water to care for his voice.\n\"Phew.\"\nFinally getting a break, the women let out a collective sigh of relief. They started massaging sore muscles and grabbing some water.\nThe women were divided into two groups. Three women who'd been dragged here from the Heavenly Orchid Society and somehow ended up singing hymns with Baek Cheon. And seven courtesans who'd come to play instruments for the practice.\nThey were all in the same place, but there was an awkward vibe between them. Finally, one of the singers broke the ice.\n“This must be pretty tough for you all, huh?”\n\"It'd be a lie to say it's not tiring, but it's worth it.\"\n\"Worth it?\"\n\"Thanks to the Maitreya Luminous Cult folks, we can earn money now. More than that, we can just be performers now. We don’t have to sell our bodies anymore if we don't want to, and no one punishes us for it. Being able to pay them back for that, even with just a little music… of course it’s worth it.”\nThat was the main reason all seven courtesans had volunteered.\nAnd since the taverns and brothels had all taken the previous night off for the gathering, they had the energy to spare.\nIn the strange atmosphere, one courtesan spoke calmly.\n\"Do you all remember what the Incarnation of Maitreya said at last night's gathering?\"\n\"Do you mean ‘A Day Without Work is a Day Without Food'?\"\n\"Yes. To me, that saying felt like it meant the opposite.\"\n\"???\"\nWhen everyone looked at her with puzzled expressions, she smiled gently.\n“‘If you don’t work, you don’t eat.’ Doesn't that also mean, ‘If you do work, you get to eat’? It’s a promise, right? I was sold here to pay off a debt. I worked—I was forced to sell my body—and I never got paid a single cent for any of it.”\n\"......\"\nNo one knew what to say to that.\nIt wasn't just that they felt sorry for her. It was that almost every woman there had a similar story.\nRather than sympathy, it was more like empathy.\nThe three singers might not have been sold to a brothel, but they were basically the property of the Heavenly Orchid Society Leader.\nAnd that courtesan was speaking up because she knew these women were in similar circumstances to her own.\nHer face was a strange mix of sorrow for the past and relief for the future.\n“But now, when I work, I get to make a living. I can't be punished or beaten anymore just for refusing to sell my body.”\nMaybe it was her courage in sharing her story. Maybe it was the fact that everyone there knew exactly what she was talking about.\nWhatever the reason, the barrier between the two groups of women just melted away. Soon they were all chatting quietly, sharing names and stories.\nAnd without anyone noticing...\nJin Hayeon, who'd been standing watch several steps back, had the tiniest smile on her lips.\nA smile of absolute pride in the man she worked for.\nMeanwhile...\nOn the opposite side of the estate, where the women and Baek Cheon were busy coordinating hymns, the construction crew who'd finished their meal were once again hard at work on construction.\n“Glo~ ry! Glory! O’ Divine Cult!!”\nThey could hear the music practice faintly in the distance.\nThe former beggars had also attended last night's gathering, so they knew the hymn.\nNaturally, they too began humming that catchy song.\n“Glo~ ry! Glory! O’ Divine Cult!!”\nBefore long, even the workers who'd never attended a gathering were all humming the hymn as they continued their labor.\nWatching this scene of everyone singing a work song he'd never heard before in his life, Deok Gwang tilted his head in confusion.\n“Glo~ ry! Glory! O’ Divine Cult!!”\nBut the song was leaking from his own mouth all the same.\nA few hours later, as the sun was starting to set, the music group returned to the main site.\nRight on cue, a cart with dinner arrived, and several new people appeared at the estate while pulling a cart.\n\"The sun will set soon, so how about we stop construction for today?\"\nDeok Gwang nodded. “Alright, that’s a wrap for today! Dinner time!”\nAt his instruction, the workers and former beggars gathered around the cart, and the women who'd been rehearsing also settled down beside the workers and began eating.\n“Great work today,” some of the women said to the construction crew and the men broke into goofy grins.\n“Since we have come together like this, it must be fate. Please, join us.”\nA few of the more sociable ones started mixing, and soon everyone was chatting while they ate.\nAfter dinner, the courtesans headed back to town for their own jobs. Then, the masked woman stood before the workers.\n\"Here's today's wages. Everyone worked hard.\"\nThe workers were pleased with the slightly more generous wages than they usually received.\nBut the men who used to be beggars…\n\"......\"\nThey just stared at the money in their hands. After so long, working a real job and earning real pay… the look on their faces was impossible to describe.",

    "content": "Chapter 207: A Day Without Work is a Day Without Food (4)\nThe next morning.\nAround mid-morning the next day, Il-mok woke up and casually strolled out of the building to get his training as always.\nEver since settling down in Lanzhou, his schedule had been mostly pawning off any important work to Dam Bin or Jin Hayeon and then spending most of his time either training or resting.\nOn his way to the training grounds, Il-mok spotted someone in the middle of the branch complex who looked like a complete wreck.\nIt was Baek Cheon.\nWell the guy was always a bit off his rocker, but today he was a wreck in a different way.\nInstead of his usual bright eyes, he had this crazed, hunted look. His eyeballs were completely bloodshot, and his hair looked like a bird’s nest he’d been trying to rip off his own head.\n'Nope. I’m not dealing with that shit.'\nKnowing that the smart move was to steer clear of crazy people, Il-mok quickly turned his gaze away.\n\"Young Master!!!\"\nBut Baek Cheon, who'd clearly lost his damn mind, shouted like he'd just found his savior and rushed toward Il-mok. Fınd the newest release on novel~fire~net\n\"Hah... What is the problem now?\"\n\"A disaster, Young Master! A complete disaster! I'm terrified that my own pathetic shortcomings will keep me from achieving the monumental task you gave me!\"\n\"I have no idea what the hell you're... Ahem. Just slow down and explain.\"\n\"Yesterday, while performing with the entertainers, I was struck by a multitude of inspirations. So I returned to the branch, and from evening onward, I managed to capture those countless inspirations and successfully compose several new hymns!\"\n\"...Good job.\"\nIl-mok said in a lukewarm tone.\nThough it was still praise.\nTruth was, Il-mok had only taught Baek Cheon four hymns total.\nHe may have had his run-ins with the church back when he was Seo Ji-hoon, but he wasn't some genius who could remember every hymn he'd ever heard.\nHe’d only managed to remember the four catchiest or most overplayed ones, and even then, only the first verses.\nThey were already sick of singing the same four songs on a loop, so new material was definitely good news.\nIt's just that Baek Cheon looked so wrecked that Il-mok felt uneasy giving his praise.\n\"So what exactly is the problem?\"\n\"The brilliant melodies I created are trying to leave my head!\"\nIl-mok thought, 'What the hell is he talking about?' , but Baek Cheon was too far gone in his madness and rambled.\n\"I've been humming them all night long to keep from forgetting, but I can't keep this up forever! You have to let me see the courtesans again! I need to teach them the songs right now so they can memorize them for me!\"\nIt was hard to make out what he was saying through his manic babbling, but Il-mok got the general idea.\n'Is this because I told him he couldn't meet with the courtesans today?'\nThose ladies were just helping Baek Cheon out as a favor. At the end of the day, they belonged to the entertainment house.\nSince they had to entertain guests from evening until dawn, he couldn't just call them over for practice every single day.\nObviously, the solution here wasn't to summon them so Baek Cheon could teach them hymns.\n\"Those women have their own lives. Why don't you just write down the tunes you came up with? Wouldn't that make it way easier to teach them later?\"\n\"Write them down? How exactly? Like 'Aah~ Aaak! Aaaaak~~ Aaak!!' on paper? How would anyone read the melody from that later?\"\nIl-mok scratched his head once and gave instructions to Dam Bin and Ju Seo-yeon, who were walking beside him.\n\"Can you get me some paper and a brush?\"\nOnce Dam Bin and Ju Seo-yeon brought the paper, brush and ground the ink, Il-mok suddenly drew five lines across the paper.\n\"When it comes down to it, a melody is all about two things: how high or low the notes are, and how long you hold them, right?\"\n\"That's correct, Young Master.\"\n\"Alright then, what if we did it like this? Use these five lines to show the pitch, and then use little symbols to show the rhythm.\"\nIl-mok was essentially teaching Baek Cheon the modern idea of a musical staff.\nIl-mok was no expert in music, but thanks to his mandatory schooling back in the day, he at least knew how to read and write sheet music.\n\"Last thing. Over on the side here, you can write down the tempo of the song. Let's use five levels: Super Fast, Fast, Normal, Slow, and Super Slow. It won't be perfectly accurate, but it'll be enough to jog your memory later. You can just tell the musicians the tricky parts in person when you practice with them, okay?\"\nWhen Il-mok finished his explanation—\nThud.\nBaek Cheon suddenly dropped to his knees and kowtowed to Il-mok.\n\"Young Master's grace is as vast as the ocean itself! I will follow the Heavenly Demon's will and your command to spread the glory of our faith! I will work until my dying day—no, I'll sacrifice my life—to use this system to write, record, and spread glorious hymns far and wide!\"\nSeeing Baek Cheon kowtowing to him with bloodshot eyes and looking like a beggar, Il-mok simply concluded that Baek Cheon’s brand of madness had shot up to another level.\n\"I know this is rude, but my ideas are vanishing as we speak! This worthless fool must go now and write them down!\"\n\"G-Go on, then.\"\nSince the madman himself was offering to leave quickly, Il-mok saw no reason to stop him.\nBaek Cheon took off in a blur of motion that you could practically hear the wind blow with his movements.\nIl-mok stared at the space where the madman had been standing, yawned once, and headed toward the training grounds with his leisurely gait.\n\"Hm?\"\nThen, realizing something, Il-mok turned around with a puzzled expression.\nDam Bin and Ju Seo-yeon, who should have been following him, were frozen in place like they'd been nailed to the ground.\n\"What's wrong?\"\nHearing how completely nonchalant he sounded, Dam Bin stared at Il-mok as if he wasn't even human.\nEven Ju Seo-yeon, who generally showed little interest in anything besides Jin Hayeon, couldn't hide her astonishment this time.\nSeveral days later.\nBaek Cheon went back to the construction site, this time with Jin Hayeon, three other ladies, and seven courtesans in tow.\nHe found a quiet building on the property and handed out sheet music to the courtesans.\n\"This melody came to me through inspiration, and I've recorded it using the method taught to me by the Incarnation of Maitreya. Furthermore, since the Incarnation of Maitreya selected this melody himself, you must play it with the utmost devotion.\"\nBaek Cheon's words were only half true.\nThe full story was that after Il-mok taught him how to write music, Baek Cheon had spent the past few days basically forgetting to eat or sleep while battling it out with the sheet music.\nThanks to that, he'd created over ten new hymns and tried to teach them all to the courtesans.\nBut then—\n\"Sing the songs you've composed.\"\nIl-mok suddenly stopped him.\nAfter listening to all the hymns Baek Cheon had written and composed, Il-mok picked up just one sheet of paper with his finger.\n\"Only teach the courtesans this one. The other melodies are either too difficult to sing or don't stick in your ear, so they're not suitable as hymns.\"\nOut of all the songs he'd written like a madman over several days, only one was approved.\nBut Baek Cheon wasn't displeased.\nTo Baek Cheon, Il-mok had already become someone he respected second only to the Heavenly Demon—even surpassing his own father.\nAnd far from being upset, he wanted to whip himself for still failing to meet the Young Master's expectations.\n\"Um, how exactly are we supposed to play from looking at this?\"\nWhen one courtesan raised her hand to ask, Baek Cheon taught them how to read sheet music based on what he'd learned from Il-mok.\nOn top of that, he added verbal explanations for the subtle details that couldn't be conveyed through the notation alone as he taught them the new hymn.\nMeanwhile, construction work was still happening on the other side of the manor. And just like last time, when the sun started to set, the workers and the women all ate dinner and chatted together.\nThe former beggars were settling into their new routine.\nMeanwhile, across town as the sun went down, things were different.\nIn the shantytown under the bridge, a bunch of glum beggars were huddled together.\n\"Hey. You hear the news?\"\n\"You mean about the guys who went off and joined that Maitreya Luminous Cult?\"\nThese beggars had trusted the Beggars Gang members and returned here out of suspicion that the Maitreya Luminous Cult might have some hidden agenda.\nBut all that remained for them was even greater misfortune.\n\"That fellow Gong Cheol is positively glowing, I hear.\"\n\"Guess he really hated not being able to wash while living as a beggar. They say he's bathing all the time now.\"\n\"Yeah? And he bought a bunch of new clothes.\"\n\"He bought multiple outfits after just five days of work?\"\n\"The pay must be pretty good. And they give 'em a place to sleep and food, so what's left to spend money on?\"\n\"I saw Cheol Gu in the market last night. He was actually walking and talking with a woman.\"\n\"...No way.\"\nIt had only been five days, but the beggars who left to join the Maitreya Luminous Cult were already living happy new lives.\nBut it wasn't just envy that made them miserable.\nGrrrrowl.\nAs thunder rumbled from the beggars' stomachs, one middle-aged beggar sighed and said, \"You all sure have a lot of energy for talking for a bunch of rats who haven’t eaten in days.\"\nThe others shut up and sheepishly looked away.\nWith fewer beggars around, there should've been more food for everyone. But in reality, most of them hadn't eaten in days.\nWhy? Because after that last public gathering, people had pretty much stopped giving them handouts.\nTo be precise, rumors had spread throughout Lanzhou that beggars deliberately didn't wash to look more pitiful for begging.\nPeople in this city were already stingy to begin with, thanks to the Heavenly Orchid Society. Just when things seemed to be improving after the Heavenly Orchid Society was gon, an even greater misfortune had befallen the beggars.\n\"Instead of staying like this, shouldn't we just go there too?\"\n\"We already refused last time. Do you think they will take us now?\"\n\"I actually bumped into Sam-sik. He said the door's always open as long as we don't betray the cult.\"\nAs a few beggars whispered among themselves, the middle-aged beggar clicked his tongue lightly and pointed somewhere with his eyes.\nHe was looking at the hut where the Beggars Gang guys were staying.\nOnly then did the beggars shut their mouths, but the Beggars Gang members who'd trained in martial arts had already heard everything.\nHowever, the Beggars Gang members didn't scold the beggars.\nThey just looked toward the shack with complicated expressions.\nInside was their leader, Hong Gae.\nHong Gae hadn't left his shack since that last gathering.\n\"Tch.\"\nUnable to bear the frustration, the Three-Knot beggar kid entered the shack.\n\"Branch Leader.\"\nHong Gae looked up at him, his eyes completely unfocused.\nHong Gae had been trapped in his own heart demon since that gathering.\n—One side offers them jobs and pay. The other just lets them keep begging and maybe stops them from getting kicked around a few times. So tell me, which one is really helping the beggars?\nThat devil’s question wouldn't leave his mind.\nFor someone who prided himself on being a Beggars Gang’s folk for decades, the question the snake had posed shook the very foundation of his life.\nThe only thing keeping him from completely snapping was the stable martial art he practiced. If he'd been a user of Demonic Arts or some Unorthodox Faction’s martial arts, he would've already gone berserk from Qi Deviation.\nThe Three-Knots beggar roughly understood Hong Gae's condition, but he couldn't just stand by and watch anymore.\n\"Looks like the beggars want to go to that estate.\"\n\"...The ones who already left... are they doing okay?\"\nWhen the Three-Knots beggar nodded with a complicated expression, Hong Gae let out a deep sigh.\n\"Let those who want to go.

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 208 : Hero (1)",
    "content": "Chapter 208: Hero (1)\nA few days ago.\nThousands of li away from Lanzhou, the capital city of Gansu Province.\nAmong the countless peaks of the Tianshan Mountain Range located in the west of Xinjiang, there stood a facility with a plaque that read Hall of the Demonic Way.\nIn the Hall Master's chamber, Yeom Ga-hwi and Chu Il-hwan were deep in conversation.\n\"How's that person settling in?\"\n\"He's adapting well enough, Hall Master.\"\nThe \"person\" they were discussing wasn't some fresh-faced disciple who'd just entered the Hall of the Demonic Way.\n\"Give him another month or so, and I think he'll be ready to take over my teaching duties without any major issues.\"\nThey were talking about a new instructor.\nEven after Il-mok had graduated from the Hall of the Demonic Way, changes kept rolling through the institution.\nActually, the changes were only getting bigger.\nIt was all because of the massive educational reform that Il-mok had drafted, the Heavenly Demon had ordered, and the First Disciple was now directing.\nStarting three years from now, disciples would enter the Hall of Demonic Way at eighteen instead of sixteen, and the number of students per grade would increase accordingly.\nAnd obviously, more students equals more teaching personnel in need.\nInstead of trying to do everything at once, the Hall of Demonic Way decided to hire the new staff first to let them get some on-the-job training.\n\"The expansion work on the Black Dragon Pavilion and Black Tiger Pavilion is proceeding smoothly so far, Hall Master. The whole project should be done in two years, but we should have some of the new space ready to use within a year.\"\nYeom Ga-hwi nodded at Chu Il-hwan's report.\nThe plan wasn't to suddenly flood the place with new students. They were going to ease into it, increasing the class size bit by bit.\nThis year, they'd stick with the usual twenty students, but next year, they'd bump it up to thirty.\nAnd with each increase, they'd add one more assistant and instructor per grade to run another test, with plans to recruit up to forty students per grade in two years.\nThen, three years from now, they'd finally switch to recruiting eighteen-year-olds instead of sixteen-year-olds as originally planned.\nForty new disciples—that was the official number decided by the Grand Teacher's department.\nChu Il-hwan continued with various other reports.\nHe covered things like the student clubs, notes on individual students, and how well they were all doing in their classes.\n\"To be honest, the disciples' average skill level has dropped compared to when the Eighth Young Master was here.\"\n\"That year was simply an anomaly. Compared to other years, there's not much difference, is there?\"\n\"That's true.\"\nAfter they'd finished discussing all the various changes happening at the Hall of the Demonic Way...\nAfter reading through the entire written report that Chu Il-hwan had submitted, Yeom Ga-hwi looked at him with a somewhat suspicious expression.\n\"Head Instructor Chu Il-hwan.\"\n\"Yes, Hall Master.\"\n\"Can you swear to me that none of your useless prejudices or personal opinions snuck into these reports?\"\n\"W-what happened with the Eighth Young Master will absolutely never happen again.\"\nCold sweat trickled down Chu Il-hwan's back as he answered.\nLately, Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi had been treating Chu Il-hwan with deep suspicion.\nAnd it wasn't because of that time he'd been tricked by the old Vice Director and lost his mind.\n\"See that it doesn't. Pinning the label of 'lecher' on an innocent kid who's done nothing is not acceptable.\"\n\"Y-you're absolutely right, Hall Master.\"\nThe truth was, Hall Master Yeom Ga-hwi had recently been called to the Heavenly Demon Palace and had come back completely mortified.\n\"Hehehehe. Hall Master Yeom, did you hear that rumor?\"\n\"I spend all my time at the Hall of the Demonic Way, so I haven't heard any particular rumors.\"\n\"Looks like my youngest is starting to think about marriage. He came right out and said he likes women in their prime years.\"\nSeeing his great lord go so far as to call the Eighth Young Master 'my youngest,' Yeom Ga-hwi forced himself to reply in a neutral tone.\n\"Is that so?\"\nBut something felt off. His lord's reaction was different from usual.\n'Was he perhaps hoping for a bit more flattery?'\nYeom Ga-hwi wondered if maybe the Heavenly Demon had been hoping to hear some praise about the Eighth Young Master, but what came out of his lord's mouth was completely different.\n\"Don't you think something's strange about this, Hall Master Yeom?\"\n\"Nothing in particular comes to mind, Lord of Ten Thousand Demons.\"\n\"How odd. Weren't you the one who reported that my youngest's only weakness is a love for the ladies'?\"\n\"...Isn't it precisely because of that tendency that the Eighth Young Master is already thinking about marriage?\"\n\"My, my, you weren't listening carefully, were you, Hall Master Yeom? I clearly said our youngest is looking for a woman 'in her prime years.' Tell me, were there any women in their prime years among the Hall of Demonic Way disciples?\"\nOnly then did Yeom Ga-hwi realize what had gone wrong, and he swallowed hard without meaning to. The Heavenly Demon chuckled softly as he stroked his beard.\n\"Hahaha. Oh, dear. I always thought you were such an upright and fair man, Hall Master Yeom, but it seems this old man was mistaken. To think you'd pin the false accusation of 'lecher' on an innocent child.\"\nSomehow, despite the jovial atmosphere, cold sweat kept pouring down Yeom Ga-hwi's face.\nSince that day, Yeom Ga-hwi had been distrustful of Chu Il-hwan.\nTo be precise, while he trusted and entrusted him with all other matters, he was completely unable to trust evaluations concerning the students—especially assessments related to their 'character or disposition'.\nFrom Chu Il-hwan's perspective, this was unfair in many respects. Thɪs chapter is updated by novｅlfire.net\nHe wasn't the only one who thought that about the kid! The other teachers did too, and the Hall Master himself had seen the evidence and agreed with them back then!\nBut there was no way he could ever say that to the Hall Master’s face.\nWas it because he held the Hall Master, the great 'Fist Demon' Yeom Ga-hwi, in such high esteem?\n...Actually, that wasn't it.\n'Even if I transferred somewhere else, it'd be exactly the same. Damn it.'\nIt was just the bitter reality of being a middle-level employee.\nAfter finally finishing the nerve-wracking meeting with the Hall Master...\nAnd so, after finally getting through the stressful meeting with the boss, Chu Il-hwan headed somewhere to find peace of mind.\nHe wasn't going to the infirmary for mental health counseling.\n\"Head Instructor Chu!\"\nHis destination was Instructor Xiao Hong's office.\n\"Hahaha. When it's just the two of us, there's no need to be so stiff and formal.\"\nA far cry from his old, awkward self, Chu Il-hwan was back to his usual smooth-talking ways with her.\nXiao Hong also glanced around quickly before breaking into a bright smile.\n\"Just being careful, you never know. Hehe.\"\nThe old bachelor and old maid had somehow become lovers.\nWhile the Hall of the Demonic Way was caught up in winds of change...\n\"Is the textbook for the intermediate course done yet?\"\n\"W-well, about that...\"\n\"Are you out of your mind right now?! We need to finish it by tomorrow and report to the Grand Teacher!\"\nThe organization driving these changes—the Demon-Teaching Pavilion—was being shredded to pieces by the hurricane of transformation.\nGiven the massive scale of the reforms they were pushing through, they had way too much work to handle.\nThe desks of everyone in the Demon-Teaching Pavilion were literally buried under mountains of paperwork.\nThe education system they were currently preparing was divided into four major stages.\nFirst, kids around ten years old would get two years of basic schooling at their local village branch.\nThen from age twelve to fifteen, they'd establish facilities called \"Elementary Demon Halls\" in several major counties, gathering children from multiple counties for more advanced lessons.\nThe curriculum included basic arithmetic, more complex Hanja beyond the Thousand Character Classic, more intricate doctrine, and fundamental martial arts instead of Demonic Arts.\nAfter four years there, they'd be sorted.\nHigh-achieving students would go to places called \"Middle Learning Halls\" built in what passed for cities within Xinjiang, while children with substandard grades would return to their family trades.\nAnd at the Middle Learning Halls, they'd split into three paths: children with talent for martial arts would begin learning Demonic Arts, while those without martial talent but with good heads would receive administrative or practical training according to their aptitudes, or training in medicine.\nHowever, the Demonic Arts taught at the Middle Learning Halls would be basic ones without serious side effects.\nThen, in the year the children turned eighteen, those with outstanding martial achievements would take the entrance examination for the Hall of the Demonic Way.\nChildren who passed would enter the Hall to learn advanced Demonic Arts and receive training to become elite warriors of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nThose who failed would return to their hometowns to start as regular martial artists in the local branch offices. As for the administrative and medical students, they'd go to the main headquarters for internships in the different departments.\nAnd right now, the Demon-Teaching Pavilion was preparing the entire education system except for what related to the Hall of the Demonic Way itself.\nNaturally, those being ground to dust in the division felt conflicting emotions about the Eighth Young Master.\nOn one hand, they marveled at the Eighth Young Master's intelligence for conceiving such a systematic education system in just a few days while lying in an infirmary bed recovering from injuries.\n\"I swear, this work never ends...\"\n\"At least you got to go home yesterday. I've been sleeping here for three days straight.\"\n\"You had time to sleep? Your workload must be pretty light.\"\nThey resented the Eighth Young Master for shoving them into this hellscape.\nThe Eighth Young Master had presented a truly excellent education system.\nThe problem was, he'd only provided the big framework.\nWhether it was the Elementary Demon Halls or the Middle Learning Halls, creating the actual textbooks was work the staff had to do.\nAnd it didn't end with just making textbooks. They had to train instructors to teach children using those textbooks and handle all the business related to establishing the Middle Learning Halls that hadn't even been built yet.\nThe number of other problems that popped up along the way was endless.\nOf course, the one who'd ordered the education reform was ultimately the Heavenly Demon. Logically, their resentment should have been directed at the Heavenly Demon, but for members of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, resenting the Heavenly Demon was unthinkable.\nThe Heavenly Demon was an object of absolute faith, so ultimately their resentment could only turn toward the easy target—Il-mok.\nNot that they could ever actually complain out loud.\n\"Who said that? Who just dared to complain?\"\nWi Jin-hak, the Grand Teacher and First Disciple, had appeared out of nowhere. A deathly silence fell over the office.\n\"Your heads are full of demons. Have you forgotten how important the work you're doing is to our great Heavenly Demon Divine Cult?\"\nBut he wasn't ruling their resentment through fear alone.\nAfter scaring the hell out of them with a blast of his murderous aura, Wi Jin-hak reined it in and looked at them with a serious expression.\n\"The kids who grow up with the system we're building today will be the shining future of this cult in ten years! Imagine that day!\"\nAt Wi Jin-hak's cry, those being ground down by their work began to swim through their imaginations with dazed expressions.\n\"Imagine our children kicking out those pathetic unbelievers from the Central Plains and offering salvation to the people!\"\nEither way, they were all people who'd been educated in the cult's doctrine for decades.\n\"Imagine every single person in the world praising the name of our Great Heavenly Demon Divine Cult!\"\nTheir faith in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult was beyond question.\n\"The Heavenly Demon Descends!!\"\n\"Ten Thousand Demons Obeys!!\"\n\"Make the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult Great Again!!!\"\nWith their resentment replaced by fanatical zeal, they suddenly started shouting at the top of their lungs and threw themselves back into their work with bloodshot eyes.\nWatching the fanatics voluntarily diving back into the hurricane of work, Wi Jin-hak nodded with a satisfied expression.\n'I found it frustrating at first, thinking fistfights were easier, but I'm getting used to this.'\nAt some point, Wi Jin-hak became an excellent leader of fanatics.\nYou could say it was because he'd had plenty of chances to watch his Master and his youngest brother working their magic on their followers.",

    "content": "Chapter 209: Hero (2)\nLate in the evening.\nWi Jin-hak left the Demon-Teaching Pavilion and headed toward the Heavenly Demon Palace to report on the progress of the educational reforms.\n\"I greet the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons.\"\nAs Wi Jin-hak paid his respects to his Master with utmost reverence, the Heavenly Demon nodded with a pleased smile spreading across his face.\n\"Hahaha. You may rise.\"\nWi Jin-hak noticed something different today. The Heavenly Demon was already known for being a benevolent master to his disciples, but today he seemed particularly soft and warm.\n\"Did something good happen, Master?\"\n\"A letter has come from our youngest.\"\n\"Youngest did?\"\nJust hearing the word 'youngest' was enough to bring a smile to Wi Jin-hak's face as well.\n\"Hahaha. I can't wait to hear what brilliant thing our youngest has pulled off this time, Master.\"\n\"Hoho. You should be. I was quite surprised myself after reading the letter.\"\nWhile the two brothers smiled warmly at each other...\n'Great. What fresh hell is the Eight Young Master about to unleash on us now?'\nOnly the Hiiden Guard Pavilion Master maintained his expressionless face, hiding his worries beneath it.\nThose two were in positions of authority, so naturally they'd find Il-mok's various changes impressive and clever.\nBut to the people who actually had to do the work, that kid's mouth was a one-way ticket to disaster.\nThe Demon-Teaching Pavilion might be suffering the worst, but everywhere else was equally tormented by the fires Il-mok had lit.\nStarting with the Black Tortoise Corps, who now live full-time at Peach Blossom Ridge, caring for dementia patients due to a sudden change in orders, to the various martial corps running back and forth to Xinjiang nonstop to escort children travelling between the academy and their hometowns.\nAnd because those squads were busy playing bodyguard, the ones left behind were understaffed and had to run patrols all day around without rest.\nOn top of that, there were the sorcerers from the An Family and Eight Trigrams Hall who wandered Xinjiang all day searching for water veins for some \"Make Our Xinjiang Green\" project or whatever it was called.\nBasically, every single department that had people reassigned to these new projects was getting swamped.\nThankfully, the Hidden Guard Pavilion was spared from the disaster since its job was to guard the Heavenly Demon.\nHe found it amusing that the people who used to look down on the Hidden Guard Pavilion for doing menial work were now dying for a transfer.\nAnd a letter from the architect of all this chaos had just landed in the Heavenly Demon's hands.\n\"Hoho. Our youngest is spreading word of our cult in Gulang County under the name of Maitreya Luminous Cult and is recruiting new followers.\"\n\"A fake name?\"\nWi Jin-hak, who had been smiling gently, asked back with a somewhat displeased tone.\n\"No matter how brilliant our youngest may be, to hide the name of our great Divine Cult... I fear this may not be the proper course of action, Master.\"\nTo Wi Jin-hak's criticism, the Heavenly Demon relayed the contents of the letter.\n\"Think about it like this. When one first encounters unfamiliar food from a foreign land, isn't it natural to be wary of it? Therefore, Il-mok plans to disguise it as food familiar to the Central Plains people, allowing them to adapt to our teachings.\"\nIt was the so-called \"food theory\" that Il-mok had used to persuade Dam-bin and Jin Hayeon.\nThe Heavenly Demon also explained the methods Il-mok had employed for his proselytizing activities.\nHe explained the classic lure of “Have you heard about the Way?” complete with honey traps and even punishing evildoers to save the common people.\n\"Master, shouldn't we inform all the other Central Plains branches about these proselytizing methods?\"\nCompletely blown away by these tactics he'd never even considered, Wi Jin-hak suggested this, and the Heavenly Demon nodded with a satisfied expression.\n\"That is my intention. However, there is an order to things. Since our youngest is trying to take control of Gansu Province starting with Lanzhou, we should first send some reinforcement there.\"\n\"He's already targeting Lanzhou? How very like our youngest.\"\nThe two wore expressions of anticipation, wondering how their youngest would seize Lanzhou and what methods he'd use for his proselytizing activities.\nSeveral days later.\nA few days later, a few dozen hand-picked cult members secretly set off from Xinjiang, heading for Gansu.\nThe fact that Il-mok was active in Gansu Province was top secret known only to the Heavenly Demon and a few key figures. As far as the people of the cult know, Il-mok was sent away from the main headquarters on a special mission assigned by the Heavenly Demon.\nThis was just common sense. Just as the cult has spies on the Central Plains, so does the Murim Alliance on the cult.\nAnd just as the Heavenly Demon expected, spies planted by the Murim Alliance were active throughout Xinjiang.\nSome of them were just lying low and watching, as usual.\n\"Everyone seems to have much brighter expressions these days.\"\nBut some moved more actively.\n\"Well, isn't it all thanks to the Eighth Young Master?\"\nWhen a middle-aged man said this with a bright smile, the Murim Alliance spy who had initiated the conversation asked while managing his expression.\n\"Oh, really? Hahaha. He's done a lot for us, has he?\"\n\"He sure has! Wells have been built in the village so we don't have to worry about dying of thirst, and the children are even learning to read! What more could you ask for? Hahaha.\"\n\"He sounds like a real saint, too bad I've never had the chance to see him myself.\"\n\"Oh, that's too bad. I've at least seen him from a distance.\"\nHearing that, the spy's eyes flashed.\nThese few proactive Murim Alliance spies were operating under special orders from the Flying Dragon Pavilion Master.\nThey had received special orders to scrape up any information about the Eighth Young Master they could find.\n\"Do you think you could... describe him for me? You know, in case I run into him. I'd want to recognize him so I can thank him properly.\"\n\"Hahaha! For a reason like that? Of course! Happy to help.\"\nLittle chats like this were happening all over Xinjiang, and by compiling the gathered information, the spies succeeded in creating a facial composite of the Eighth Young Master.\nThe spies looked at the completed composite with serious expressions.\n\"His mouth is bold, always carrying a hearty and refreshing laugh. His skin is like white jade, his jaw is as sharp as a blade, and his nose bridge is as prominent as Mount Tai. And above all, his eyes are full of intelligence and contain the spirit of a hero that can stop you dead in your tracks.\"\nIf one were to describe in words the composite they had completed, it would be roughly this face.\nAnyone who knew Il-mok's actual face would have made a bizarre face upon seeing that composite.\nLet's talk about Il-mok's eyes. To put it nicely, he had a pair of indifferent eyes. To put it bluntly, they are a pair of completely vacant eyes of a burnt-out middle-aged manager of a black company. Basically, he has dead-fish eyes.\nHis jaw was also \"reasonably\" sharp, but not blade-like as depicted in the composite, and his nose was reasonably high, but not like Mount Tai.\nMoreover, he wasn't the type to laugh boldly in the first place, so his mouth didn't look like that either.\nEyes, nose, mouth, face shape... every part was almost right, but just a little bit off.\nAnd when you added up all those \"little bit offs,\" you got a completely different person.\nIf you had to judge Il-mok's face, it was decent-looking enough to be considered reasonably handsome. Thɪs chapter is updated by N()velFire.net\nBut thanks to those dead fish eyes, he came across less like a legendary hero and more like the handsome slacker who lives down the street.\nThe reason for this epic mistake was actually pretty simple.\nPeople tend to see what they want to see.\nThose who had actually seen Il-mok's face had distorted their own memories.\nThey were so blown away by all the amazing things he'd done that they basically saw him through real-life rose-colored glasses.\n'Our beloved Eighth Young Master can't possibly be that plain!'\n'Exactly! His eyes sparkle with genius!'\nAnd that's how a genius sparkle he never had got permanently carved onto his face in their minds.\nOn top of that, it is the nature of a rumor to double in size in proportion to the number of people it passes through.\nSince there were so many stories about the amazing things he'd done, his legend was constantly being exaggerated and retold all over the province.\n\"He must be a heroic man.\"\nAt this point, the legend of Il-mok's face had gotten so out of control that a fortune teller would've taken one look, hit the floor, and started yelling, \"All hail the future Emperor!\"\n\"But seriously, can a person even look like this?\"\nNaturally, the spies were skeptical at first; the description was downright ridiculous.\n\"But everyone is telling the exact same story! It's not just one or two guys. The description is almost identical everywhere we go. So even if the sketch isn't perfect, the real deal must be pretty damn close.\"\nSince the story was the same everywhere, the spies had to accept it as fact.\n\"Well. It's definitely a memorable face. The moment we encounter him, there's no way we won't recognize that face.\"\n\"I can't believe a piece of scum from the Demonic Cult looks like that.\"\nFlames of jealousy and anger burned in the spies' eyes at this incredible face that would probably have women lining up just from walking down the street.\n\"A demonic cultist with a face like that must definitely be a womanizer!\"\n\"We have to report this to the Pavilion Master before this scum hurts innocent women!\"\n\"That's right! Once the Pavilion Master knows, he'll surely take some action!\"\nAnd so the spies felt a bizarre calling to save the world.\nSeveral days later.\nIn a little manor somewhere in Lanzhou.\nA man born with the face of a hero that would never exist again in this world woke from sleep.\n\"Huaaaam.\"\nThe hero who woke with a long yawn raised his upper body along with a stretch.\nAnd then he just sat there, staring into space with his usual blank expression.\n'Meh. Maybe I'll just go back to sleep.'\nIl-mok fell into the kind of slacker-like contemplation that suited his gaze.\nIt had been just over twenty days since the gathering where he had exchanged questions and answers with the Beggars Gang’s branch leader.\nIl-mok had nothing particular to do.\nTo be precise, there were many miscellaneous tasks, but others were handling those. There was simply nothing that required Il-mok's direct intervention.\nA few days after giving the beggars work and wages, other beggars who had initially refused began joining the Maitreya Luminous Cult one by one.\nAnd now, twenty days later, most of the beggars in Lanzhou were working construction at the old Heavenly Orchid Society's estate.\nThe only holdouts were the hardcore Beggars Gang loyalists and those who were too sick or disabled to do physical work.\nIn any case, thanks to the additional beggars joining, he'd heard a few days ago that construction speed had doubled.\nWith all the regular beggars who used to gather information while begging completely gone, it had become quite difficult for the Beggars Gang members to gather intelligence in Lanzhou.\nOn top of that, the Hao Clan seemed to have taken his warning to heart and was keeping its head down.\n'Well, there's no way to stop rumors spreading among the people of Lanzhou, so I'll let that slide.'\nSince they held gatherings once every ten days, it was inevitable that rumors would gradually spread.\nAnd thanks to those rumors, the number of people attending each gathering kept increasing.\nYou'd think that would be a management nightmare, but Il-mok didn't seem to care.\n‘The reinforcement should be here soon. I'll be busy when that time comes, so I should rest well today.'\nJust as he finished rationalizing his nap and was about to lie back down, a voice came from outside.\n\"Are you awake, Young Master?\"\n\"Young Master, people from the main headquarters have arrived.\"\nRealizing that today was that day, Il-mok let out a deep sigh.\n\"There goes my good day.\"\nWith an extremely annoyed expression, Il-mok got out of bed and began organizing his thoughts while yawning again.\nHe was contemplating how to put the people from the main headquarters to work, though it wasn't a particularly deep contemplation.\nHe'd already worked out the general framework in his head.\nThe sooner he could dump the work on them, the sooner he could return to peace.\n\"Tell only the representatives to enter.\"\nShortly after Il-mok's order, the door opened and several people entered the hall.\nIl-mok unconsciously sighed when he spotted a familiar face among them.\n\"I am pleased to see you again, Young Master!\"\nA man who entered the hall carrying ink, brush, and paper as if they were part of his body.\n'Ugh. Why do the crazy bastards keep multiplying?'\nIt was none other than Physician Seo Jae-pil.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 210 : Kongtong (1)",
    "content": "Chapter 210: Joining Forces (1)\n\"How did you even get here?\"\nSeo Jae-pil answered, looking like his world had ended.\n\"After the Young Master completed his training at the Hall of the Demonic Way, I sent a letter to the Demonic Physician and had a meeting with the elder. It was decided that I would return to the headquarters. However, the handover to my successor took some time, and by the time I finally made it back to headquarters, the Young Master had already left.\"\nSeo Jae-pil spoke mournfully, as if the shock of that day still hadn't worn off.\n\"But I couldn't just give up like that, so I begged the Demonic Physician every single day. I asked him to send me wherever the Young Master was.\"\n\"You made that request knowing where I was and what I was doing?\"\n\"Wherever that place might be, if the Young Master is there, wouldn't there be an abundance of research subjects?\"\nYep, still a mad scientist.\n\"Haa. So you kept pestering him, and the Demonic Physician sent you here?\"\n\"That's correct! The Young Master had requested additional personnel, so he said he would give me this opportunity!\"\n\"...I see.\"\nIl-mok let out a light sigh, realizing that this was all because of the Demonic Physician.\nNot that he was totally shocked.\nHe had asked for a physician to be sent in the first place, and his brain was hardwired to run through all the possible what-ifs, so this was technically on the list.\nIt's just that...\n'I figured since he was stuck way out at the academy when I left, there was no way he could follow me.'\nHe had considered the worst-case scenario—that Seo Jae-pil might have quit the Hall's infirmary and returned to the Pure Mind Hall in the meantime—but thought the chances were low.\n\"So what should I do from now on, Young Master?\"\nUnaware of Il-mok's inner thoughts, Seo Jae-pil asked with an innocent face.\nIt was the face of someone asking which humans he could use as test subjects.\n\"From now on, we'll be running a clinic under the name Maitreya Luminous Cult’s umbrella. Physician Seo, you'll provide free medical treatment and prescriptions to the people of this place at that clinic.\"\nThis was precisely why Il-mok had requested a physician from headquarters.\nNothing wins people over like free healthcare.\nHearing his orders, Seo Jae-pil's eyes sparkled as he replied.\n\"Does that mean I can conduct interviews during the process of examining and treating the people here? I've collected quite a few case studies on the psychology of those who learned Demonic Arts at the Hall of the Demonic Way and the main headquarters, so now I'd like to compare them with those who haven't learned Demonic Arts.\"\n\"Go ahead. Ah, but don't go dissecting living people or opening up their brains for your experiments. These are commoners, after all.\"\n\"Hahaha. You jest too much, Young Master. Would I really do such a thing?\"\nIl-mok simply look at that smiling face with eyes full of suspicion.\n\"Sigh... Just go. Miss Jin, take him to the clinic at the new compound. That part should be finished already.\"\n\"Yes, Young Master.\"\nOnce Physician Seo off with Jin Hayeon, Il-mok looked at those remaining in the hall.\nAside from Seon-ah, who stayed for guard duty, they were all faces he'd never seen before.\n\"I am Kang Yul, Third Squad Leader of White Tiger Corps.\"\n\"I am Ya Yul-pae, Fourth Squad Leader of Red Tiger Corps.\"\n\"I am Won Sul, Vice Head of the Orthodox Doctrine Division of the Demon-Teaching Pavilion.\"\n\"A pleasure to meet you. I am the Eighth Disciple, Il-mok. Can each of you tell me how many people you brought with you?\"\n\"I have nine from the White Tiger Corps’ Third Squad, myself included.\"\n\"Red Tiger Corps’ Fourth Squad also brought nine, including myself.\"\n\"From the Demon-Teaching Pavilion, there are three of us, and since we were short on personnel, we brought three additional martial artists from the Sacred Order.\"\nTwenty-four in total. Twenty-five if you counted Physician Seo.\nIl-mok turned to the two combat squad leaders.\n\"Your mission is to sweep through the counties of this province and clean out all the low-life criminal gangs that are preying on the people.\"\nThe Heavenly Orchid Society had been a big organization since they were able to control Lanzhou, the provincial capital of Gansu. But since they entrenched themselves in Lanzhou, they can’t expand their reach to other areas of Gasu.\nThat’s when the small gangs come into play.\nWith the big snake nestling comfortably in the capital, the smaller snakes are all free to cause trouble in other counties, like that Red Serpent Gang they'd already dealt with in Gulang County.\nAnd since the Heavenly Orchid Society practically wiped out any faction that didn’t pay tribute to them, the scums who run rampant right now are pretty much gangs with the Heavenly Orchid Society as their backers.\n\"The Lanzhou Branch Leader has compiled information on the locations of these scums. Their crimes, their strengths, their weaknesses, all of that is in that file. Go talk to him first.\"\nAnd Il-mok had already grasped the general state of these scums thanks to the Heavenly Orchid Society’s ledgers.\nThose books contained detailed information about the factions they received tribute from or exchanged women and slaves with.\nUsing those books, he'd corresponded with the cult's other local branches and put together a complete intel package.\nHe had simply lacked the manpower to wipe them out until now.\nAnd now, it was time for the blade of judgment to fall on those bastards who'd been running wild like they owned the place.\n\"We obey your command!\"\nAt the order to fight evildoers for the sake of the people, Kang Yul and Ya Yul-pae answered in solemn voices.\nIt was truly a mission befitting the doctrine of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\nAfter those two left the hall to get information from the Lanzhou Branch Leader, Il-mok looked at the middle-aged man who was the Vice Head of the Orthodox Doctrine Division of the Demon-Teaching Pavilion.\nFor some reason, the guy was smiling.\n'Hehehehe. Sorry guys, but you're on your own.'\nHe was thinking about his poor coworkers back at the Demon-Teaching Pavilion who remained at headquarters.\nThe Demon-Teaching Pavilion was already the busiest organization at headquarters. And now, with three of them absent including himself, those who remained were probably having their limbs torn off in a storm of work.\nBut in his glee at having escaped that bureaucratic hell, he had forgotten one very important thing.\nThe person who had created that hell in the first place... was the Eighth Young Master, standing right in front of him.\n\"You and your team from the Demon-Teaching Pavilion have three jobs. First, I need you to invent the entire doctrine for our Maitreya Luminous Cult. Make it so that the people of the Central Plains can easily accept it by gradually mixing the doctrine of our Heavenly Demon Divine Cult into Buddhist scriptures.\"\n\"C-create the doctrine, you say?\"\n\"That's right. Second, from now on, the Vice Head will be in charge of sermons at the gatherings. Teach the new believers the doctrine you've researched and prepared. By teaching the doctrine of Maitreya Luminous Cult, you must gradually make the believers familiar with our Divine Cult's doctrine.\"\n\"......\"\n\"Lastly, teach the Thousand Character Classic to those who came with you and the people living here. Just as Physician Seo is running our free clinic, you guys are running our free school.\"\n\"......\"\nWon Sul's face, which had been glowing with happiness just moments ago, now looked like it was actively dying.\nAs if he couldn't even see Won Sul's face, Il-mok turned his head to look at Seon-ah.\n\"Tell Dam Bin to spread the word in the red-light district. If any courtesans or servants want to learn to read, they should come to that estate.\"\nAt the place that had been the Heavenly Orchid Society's estate, now stood a school and a clinic.\nHe had asked the craftsmen to prepare those two places first, and since they were repairing and renovating existing buildings rather than constructing new ones, they'd been able to finish quickly.\nAnd Il-mok, having gifted Won Sul with a new hell, said with an indifferent face.\n\"Why are you still here and not on your way?\"\n\"I-I obey your command.\"\nAs Won Sul walked away with the face of a cow being dragged to the slaughterhouse, Il-mok gave instructions to Hyeokryeon Seon-ah.\n\"Take him to Dam Bin. You might as well stop by the red-light district together, then head to the school at the estate.\"\n\"I'll see to it, big brother.\"\nAnd just like that, Il-mok finished offloading most of his work onto the new guys.\n\"Haaam.\"\nHe let out another yawn and lazy stretch and was about to take another nap when—\n\"Young Master! We have a problem!\"\nThe two combat squad leaders he'd just sent away were back, and they had the Lanzhou Branch Leader with them.\n\"What is it now?\" Il-mok asked, not even trying to hide his irritation.\n“Young Master, bringing divine punishment onto those scums is no problem. It's the... other part of the mission.\"\n\"None of our guys are pretty enough to run a honey trap.\"\n\"......\"\nThat was a problem that not even Il-mok, with his tendency to plan for every insane possibility, had ever thought of.\n'...Fucking damn it. Good-looking or pretty people aren't exactly common. Especially if they're from combat squads, they'd have picked the best fighters, not the prettiest faces.'\nIl-mok had so many attractive people around him that he'd started taking it for granted.\nHe thought for a second while the three of them stared at him expectantly.\nHaving quickly come up with a solution, Il-mok answered flatly.\n\"Go find Squad Leader Dam Bin and have her take you to the red-light district. The courtesans there are already followers. Just hire a few of them for a couple of days. Problem solved.\"\nFirst came offloading. Now came outsourcing.\nAround the time the new group from the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult arrived in Lanzhou.\nThe Three-Knot Beggar, who had received orders from Hong Gae also arrived at the Beggars Gang’s main headquarters.\nIt was a hell of a long trip, all the way from Gansu to Hebei.\nThough the Three-Knot Beggar was a First-Rate master in his own right, by the time he arrived in Tianjin where the main headquarters was located, his appearance was beyond miserable.\nHe was a beggar, so he already started with a low baseline, but now he looked so pathetic that the head of the entire Beggars Gang probably would've tossed him a coin.\nAs the Three-Knot Beggar—who was easily in the top five most miserable-looking beggars that had ever been seen—approached the main headquarters, a beggar standing guard while pretending to beg watched him intently.\nAs befitting the main headquarters, the guard beggar had four knots tied on his clothes.\nBut the suspicious gaze lasted only a moment. The rıghtful source is novel·fıre·net\nAfter checking out the Three-Knot Beggar's genuinely pathetic state and seeing the three knots on his sash, the guard got up.\n\"Where are you from?\"\n\"I've come to deliver a letter sent by Branch Leader Hong Gae of Lanzhou.\"\n\"Let me see. Lanzhou... Is this information related to the Heavenly Orchid Society?\"\n\"Yes, but it's about the people who crushed the Heavenly Orchid Society.\"\nAt the Three-Knot Beggar's answer, the Four-Knot Beggar‘s eyes went wide. He leaned in close and whispered.\n\"Don't tell me the Demonic Cult invaded!?\"\nOne would expect a terrible stench to emanate from the beggar as he came close and spoke, but the Three-Knot Beggar couldn't smell any bad odor at all. His own body odor was so bad that it canceled everything else out.\n\"It's a group called Maitreya Luminous Cult. Branch Leader Hong Gae said he couldn't make a judgment about them and asked the main headquarters to decide.\"\nThe guard realized this was a big deal. He stepped out of the way.\n\"Go on in.\"\nThe Three-Knot Beggar was finally able to enter the main headquarters, but there wasn't much to look at.\nThe Beggars Gang was a gathering of beggars to begin with, so their headquarters was just a really big slum.\nAs the Three-Knot Beggar entered the slum, a beggar with five knots approached him, and they had more or less the same conversation he'd had at the gate.\nThe Five-Knot Beggar then took the piece of bark with the message on it and went to a specific hut.\n\"Chief. A message came in from the Lanzhou Branch Leader.\"\nThat place was none other than the hut where the Chief of the Beggars Gang resided—the Drunken Jade Manor.",

    "content": "Chapter 211: Kongtong (2)\nThe Three-Knots Beggar waited with a complicated expression on his face as he kept sneaking glances at the Beggars’ Gang Chief's shabby hut every few seconds.\nBefore long, Five-Knots Beggar emerged and gestured for Three-Knots Beggar to come closer.\nConfused, the Three-Knots Beggar walked over when he heard the Five-Knots Beggar say, \"The Chief is calling for you. \"Come on, let's go in.\"\nStill not sure what was happening, the Three-Knots Beggar followed Five-Knots Beggar into the Chief's hut.\nIt was his first time meeting the Beggars’ Gang Chief up close, and his first impression was this:\n'Wow. He is the most beggar-like person I've ever seen.'\nIt might've sounded like an insult at first, but since he was talking about the king of beggars, it was actually the highest praise possible.\nTrue to Three-Knots Beggar's observation, the Chief was an old beggar with grime dripping off him. Normally, high-level masters from the Gang had a certain powerful vibe about them despite their filthy appearance.\nUsually, even if high-ranking members of the Beggars’ Gang looked like beggars, they still carried an indescribable aura about them. But the Chief just seemed like an ordinary old beggar.\nThe Three-Knots Beggar stood there dazed for a moment before hastily paying his respects.\n\"Three-Knots Beggar Jong Gu of Lanzhou greets the Chief.\"\n\"Hahaha, no need for all that. We're all just beggars here. So, you're the one who brought this?\"\n\"That's correct, Chief.\"\n\"Then you must've taken a look at that Maitreya Luminous Cult place yourself.\"\nThe Beggars’ Gang Chief muttered the words written on the tree bark as if talking to himself.\n\"What's better for beggars? Giving them jobs and a paycheck, or protecting them so they can keep begging? So, what do you think? You think they are right?”\nWhen the Three-Knots Beggar hesitated, the Chief just smiled, \"Hehehe. Don't worry. It's not like a frail old man like me is going to bite your head off.\"\nEncouraged by that gentle atmosphere, the Three-Knots Beggar took a deep breath and spoke up. \"To be honest, sir... I think they have a point.\"\nThe young beggar braced himself for the verbal smackdown he was sure was coming, but the Chief's answer wasn't what he expected at all.\n\"You are right. Hehehe. Of course! The only real way to help a beggar is to make them not a beggar anymore.\"\n\"???\"\n\"What's with that look? It's what we've been trying to do all along with our intel business. They pay us to gather information, and we sell it for them to hear. After that, we use the money to feed our fellow beggars. How is that any different from giving people work and paying them wages?\"\n\"Ah... Now that you mention it, that's absolutely true, Chief!\"\nAs the Three-Knots Beggar exclaimed in surprise, the Chief smiled faintly. \"But what we do is just barely enough to keep them from starving to death. To do it right, you'd have to go all-in like this Maitreya Luminous Cult. So, can you guess why we can't?\"\nNow that he was on the right track, the Three-Knots Beggar pondered for a moment before coming up with an answer. \"It's money, isn't it? There's just not enough cash to get every beggar in the country a real job.\"\n\"Hahaha, exactly right. Which means this Maitreya Luminous Cult must have seized all the Heavenly Orchid Society’s money after they took them down. They're using that stolen cash to fund their little charity project.\"\n\"So... does that make them the good guys?\" The Three-Knots Beggar asked. Like any young person, he was kind of impressed by their methods.\nAnd like the old man he was, the Chief gave a cautious answer drawn from the wisdom of his years.\n\"They look good on the surface, but the real problem is what happens after Heavenly Orchid Society's money runs out. We have no idea what their long-term plan is, or if they're even doing this out of the goodness of their hearts. There could be a hidden agenda. And that's why I wanted to see you.\"\n\"???\"\n\"I'm sending someone to Lanzhou to figure out if these people are truly doing this out of goodwill. Your job is to be their guide. Get them there safely and tell them everything you know.\"\nWith that, the Chief turned his head toward Five-Knots Beggar and gave an order.\n\"Go get me the Little Tiger Beggar.\"\n\"...You're giving this job to a disciple? Not one of the Elders?\"\nHu-gae or little beggar, was a term referring to the Seven-Knot Beggars who ranked just below the Eight-Knot Beggars Elders and were the Chief’s personal disciple.\n\"Gansu is in the west, so this should be the Beggar Chaser problem, but that guy is busy with Sichuan’s things, isn’t he?\nCurrently, there were four Elders in the Beggars’ Gang, and they each handled major matters by dividing the Central Plains into east, west, south, and north.\nWestern affairs were mainly handled by Elder Beggar Chaser, while northern affairs were mainly handled by Elder Sober Beggar.\n\"Besides, it's about time my student learned how to read people. The fool still thinks being Chief is just about being the best fighter.\"\nThe Five-Knots Beggar left the hut to summon Little Tiger Beggar.\nMeanwhile, things were happening all over the place in Gansu Province.\nFollowing Il-mok's orders, warriors from the White Tiger Corps and Red Tiger Corps left Lanzhou with several courtesans and headed to another county in Gansu Province.\n\"Have you heard of the Way?\"\nThere, they engaged in missionary work utilizing a honey trap for two or three days.\nOnce they'd gathered enough people, they held a gathering and demonstrated their martial prowess to those who attended.\nThey did this by eliminating the Unorthodox Faction scums who had been committing evil deeds in each county.\nThey were repeating what Il-mok and his companions had done in Gulang County.\nAnd to make it easier, they first started in counties where the Divie Cult's branch offices were located, then branched out to other places.\nAs the Unorthodox Factions gangs were being swept away one by one...\nBack in Lanzhou, at the former estate of the Heavenly Orchid Society, the plaque bearing the Society’s identity was gone, replaced by one reading [Maitreya Luminous Cult].\nDeeper inside, the construction crew of ex-beggars, led by the master carpenter Deok Gwang, was still hard at work.\nAnd two huge buildings near the entrance were packed with people.\nOne building had a sign that said [School], and classes were running inside it pretty much all day.\n\"The characters we'll learn today are from 'Black Heaven, Yellow Earth. The Universe is Desolate, and the Heaven is Limitless.’ First, let's start with the character for 'Heaven.'\"\nFrom the front of the class, Won Sul recited the lesson and painted a huge character on a sheet of paper on the wall, and all the students repeated after him.\nHowever, the students weren't writing on paper.\nWith no telling how many people they'd end up teaching, buying paper for everyone's education would be an enormous waste of money.\nInstead, everyone had a small sandbox in front of them and was tracing the characters with a stick.\nMeanwhile, across the courtyard, in the building with the [Clinic] sign, Seo Jae-pil was busy seeing patients.\nThe estate that had once been a symbol of terror was now bursting with life.\nThat night.\n\"Young Master. I really feel like I'm going to die at this rate.\"\nWon Sul looked like he had spent his day in life-and-death duels rather than teaching students and begged Il-mok for mercy.\nAnd Seo Jae-pil was there beside him.\n\"Is it the same for you, Physician Seo?\"\n\"The number of visitors is overwhelming. The line of those waiting never shortens, so I have no time to conduct my interviews and research, Young Master.\"\nWhen Physician Seo answered gloomily, Won Sul chimed in.\n\"It's the same for my team! We can just about manage the reading classes, but we have absolutely no time actually to develop the new religion's doctrine or write sermons!\"\nIl-mok crossed his arms and pondered for a moment.\nIf the one before them were his Eldest Brother or his Master, they would’ve shouted \"For the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult!\" and ground themselves out of pure fanaticism.\nBut Il-mok liked to think of himself as a reasonable person. He didn't believe in solving problems just by running his people into the ground.\nWell, to be fair, he was fine with that for a quick sprint. But this was a marathon, not a sprint, and he couldn't afford to burn everyone out.\nLike he always did, Il-mok dug his memories of modern Earth for an answer, and pretty soon, he had one.\n\"Hmm. First, for the Clinic, I'll have some of the literate women from the red-light district sent over.\"\nThe idea he'd hit on was basically creating nurses.\n\"Physician Seo, teach those courtesans basic medical care. You'll lose a bit of time at first, but once you've taught them, they'll be able to handle the easy cases for you.\"\nIt was a solution that killed two birds with one stone.\n'I remember hearing that some of those women only stay in that line of work because they don't see any other way out.'\nHe wouldn’t force them to become nurses, but he was sure some would jump at the chance for a new career.\nIt was a chance for them to start over.\nAnd he'd make sure to pay them a decent salary, of course.\nHearing all this, Won Sul saw his opening and yelled, \"In that case, send some of those women our way, too, Young Master!\"\n\"Then send us courtesans too, Young Master!\"\nIt was a demand that could have been taken the wrong way.\n\"No.\"\nBut Il-mok wasn't shutting him down for the reason you'd think.\n\"There aren't that many literate women in the red-light district to begin with. There won't be enough to send to the school. Besides, they're not the only ones who need a job. Hire some of the old folks who can't do heavy lifting, or disabled people who can read.\"\nOnce again, Il-mok had decided to subcontract the subcontracted work.\nWhile Won Sul was grinning with joy at being able to offload teaching the Thousand Character Classic, Il-mok slapped him with another idea.\n\"You know, I heard there are still a few beggars left who were too disabled to work construction. Hire them as teachers, too.\"\nHis plan was to find a job for every last beggar and put an end to the problem for good.\nWon Sul asked with a worried expression after hearing that.\n“But Young Master, they are still beggars in the end. How could beggars know how to read?”\n\"That's not a problem.\"\nFor a moment, Won Sul wore an impressed expression as if thinking, 'As expected of the Eighth Young Master, he's already thought of a solution!'\n\"You and your team can just teach them how to read first.\"\n\"......\"\nWon Sul's impressed look froze solid on his face.\n\"Hmm. Now that I think about it, it won't just be your problem. Once other counties are settled, we'll need to conduct educational volunteer work later. Draw up a plan to train more instructors for when we expand.\"\nJust when he'd gotten rid of one job, a bigger one popped up to take its place.\n\"Alright, you two can leave now.\"\nAnd with their \"problems\" solved, Il-mok kicked them out.\nThe second they were out the door, Il-mok let out a massive yawn and a stretch.\n\"Haaaaah.\"\nIt was already well past sunset. He'd been practicing his sword forms all afternoon and was feeling that nice, sleepy ache.\nHe was ready to crash on his bed when an uninvited guest arrived.\n\"Young Master. This is Kang Yul, Third Squad Leader of the White Tiger Corps. I've returned from completing my mission.\"\n\"If there's nothing special, you can just go back and rest.\"\n\"There's one unusual matter, so I'll report it before returning.\"\nHearing Kang Yul's voice from beyond the door, Il-mok let out a sigh internally.\n\"Come in.\"\nKang Yul entered and bowed.\n\"Was there some problem in Dingxi County?\"\n\"There was no particular problem eliminating the local gang that was tormenting the common people there. But the day after we finished, some people claiming to be Taoist priests from the Kongtong Sect came looking for us.\"\n\"...The Kongtong Sect?\"\nIl-mok looked completely baffled.\nHe hadn't expected to hear that name in a million years. The sect had been totally wiped out centuries ago.\n\"You're telling me the Kongtong Sect is back from the dead?\"\n\"I can't say for certain, but they claimed to be Taoist priests from the Kongtong Sect and tried to ‘help’ the people of Dingxi County.\"\nIl-mok fell into thought after hearing that.\n'Of all the times for the Kongtong Sect to pop up.'\nMount Kongtong, where the Kongtong Sect was located, was geographically quite close to Lanzhou. Close by the standard of the vast Central Plains, of course.\nThat meant that even if they were just poking around in one county for now, run-ins were going to become more common after this.\nBumping into them wasn't a huge problem. The real problem was that they are from the Orthodox Faction, and a famous one at that. Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on novel✶fire.net\nEven after suffering annihilation, their descendants spread throughout the Central Plains and founded new sects, some of which became part of the Nine Sects and One Gang.\nAnd the biggest problem was that the ones who had annihilated the Kongtong Sect were none other than the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult that Il-mok belonged to.\n'If we're not careful, all the branch headquarters in Gansu Province could get wiped out.'\nIn the worst-case scenario, the sects founded by the descendants of the Kongtong Sect could even form a coalition and attack them.\nOf course, this was just considering the worst-case scenario. In the best case, they might not even be the Kongtong Sect to begin with.\nAfter all, the real sect was long gone.\n'...Too many variables. I'm just guessing without good intel.'\nHe sighed, realizing that just sitting here thinking wasn't going to solve anything.\n'So much for a quiet life.'\nHe considered ordering others to do it, but everyone was already swamped thanks to his chain of delegation.\nMoreover, given the nature of the matter, he felt uneasy about entrusting it to someone else.\n\"Looks like I'll have to visit Dingxi County and Mount Kongtong myself.\"",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 212 : Kongtong (3)",
    "content": "Chapter 212: Kongtong (3)\nThe following dawn.\nThe group, minus Baek Cheon, slipped out of Lanzhou under the cover of darkness.\nIl-mok's official excuse was that Baek Cheon was needed in Lanzhou for the gathering and the hymn session. As for the real reason, having an attention magnet along would only cause problems since this was essentially a spy mission.\nThey made good time, alternating between sprinting with their lightness skill and taking short breaks, and reached the outskirts of Dingxi County by noon.\nIl-mok and the group split into smaller teams, each at a set distance from the others.\nThis was done both to avoid attention by reducing the number of people traveling together and partly to speed up their investigation.\nDam Bin and Seon-ah were the first to enter.\nHyeokryeon Seon-ah, the first to enter Dingxi County. They chatted about random things as they made their way through town.\n\"Excuse me, are there any inns around here?\"\nThey'd stop to talk to locals, then rent a room at an inn and order some food, putting on a show of just being two travelers enjoying a slow meal and a chat.\nBut despite their casual appearance, from the moment they'd entered Dingxi County, they'd been channeling their internal energy to enhance their hearing and eavesdropping on conversations around them.\nThe second pair was no different. Ouyang Mun and Ju Seo-yeon put on the same show but in a different location.\nAnd then there was Il-mok's group with Jin Hayeon and Jeong Hyeon.\n\"I greet the Eighth Disciple of the Supreme One.\"\nThey'd gone straight to the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's branch in Dingxi County.\nSo while everyone else was running around gathering information the hard way—\n\"I heard from Squad Leader Kang Yul that Taoists of the Kongtong Sect paid a visit here.\"\n\"That's correct, Young Master.\"\n\"Bring me files on what they've been up to and any notable rumors. All of them.\"\n—Il-mok just had to ask for the finished report.\n\"Oh, and before you get those files, draw me a bath. I worked up a sweat getting here from Lanzhou.\"\nYeah, being the boss definitely has its perks.\nThat night.\nEveryone snuck back to the cult's branch office under the cover of darkness.\nThey all gave their reports to Il-mok, who compiled them with the file he'd gotten from the Branch Leader.\nAnd the conclusion they reached was... pretty anticlimactic.\n\"So basically, they just poked around and left?\"\n\"It's thanks to us being one step ahead.\"\n\"Exactly. Because you gave Squad Leader Kang Yul instructions to spread the greatness of the Maitreya Luminous Cult here first, Young Master, they had no opening to make their move.\"\nEveryone started praising Il-mok's brilliant foresight, but Il-mok didn't look particularly pleased.\nAfter all, they'd basically made a wasted trip.\n\"Since those bastards are gone, we'll need to head to Mount Kongtong if we want to dig up more on them.\"\nIl-mok let out a light sigh and gave his orders.\n\"Alright, everyone back to the inn for some rest. We leave for Pingliang County tomorrow morning.\"\nPingliang County was the closest settlement to Mount Kongtong.\nAnd the next day, they managed to reach the vicinity of Pingliang County.\nAnd just like before, they split up before heading into the county.\nThe difference this time was that Il-mok also had to wander the marketplace searching for an inn.\nUnlike Dingxi, Pingliang didn't have a local cult office to crash at.\nThat's why they'd heard about the Kongtong Sect so late.\nAs he strolled through the market, Il-mok noticed something strange about the locals.\n'Something's off... There seem to be fewer people than there should be for a county this size.’\nMaybe he was just used to Lanzhou's bustling atmosphere, but he couldn't shake the feeling that things were oddly empty.\n'Plus, everyone looks kind of anxious?'\nEvery single person looked like they were being chased by something.\nHe saw people with shifty eyes, people who stuttered or spoke with a tremor in their voice, and a whole lot of folks with twitching hands and bouncing knees.\nNaturally, Il-mok's head turned back.\nTo Jeong Hyeon, who was trailing a few paces behind him.\n\"I-Is something wrong, Young Master?\" Jeong Hyeon stammered.\nYep, just like that.\nIt was one thing for one or two people to be that twitchy—Jeong Hyeon was living proof of that—but when half the town was doing it, something was definitely weird.\nAs that nagging feeling in his head grew stronger, Il-mok headed toward an inn visible on one side of the marketplace.\n\"Welcome...\"\nThe inn's server greeted them with a somewhat listless attitude.\n\"Let me know when you've decided.\"\nThe guy looked so profoundly lazy and bored with his job that both Jin Hayeon and Jeong Hyeon immediately looked over at Il-mok.\n(TL Note: lol.)\n\"...Is something wrong?\"\n\"...It's nothing, Young Master.\"\nJin Hayeon answered indifferently, while Jeong Hyeon awkwardly looked away, seemingly embarrassed.\nFeeling even more unsettled for no reason, Il-mok turned his head and surveyed the inn's interior.\nThere are a few customers filling in.\nThat is to say, they were in the middle of picking at their food with an attitude that suggested they were eating merely to live.\n\"Haa...\"\nSome even let out heavy sighs mid-bite.\n'Did I pick the wrong inn?'\nThinking the food here might taste like absolute shit, Il-mok ordered the most basic dishes.\nA moment later, that same server brought the food with a lethargic attitude and set it down on the table.\n\"Just in case, the two of us will taste it first, Young Master.\"\nJin Hayeon and Jeong Hyeon sampled the food first in case it was poisoned, and after they confirmed there were no issues, Il-mok also took a taste.\n\"Hm?\"\nIt didn't taste like garbage. It was just... average.\nAfter filling his stomach adequately, Il-mok called the server over again.\n\"Here's for the meal. We'll also be staying the night. Give us your best room, and get a bath ready.\"\nAs he said this, Il-mok handed the server some silver taels.\nIt was quite a large sum from the server's perspective.\n\"Sure.\"\nBut the server just pocketed the silver with that same listless attitude and shuffled off looking utterly bothered by everything.\n'What the hell is wrong with this town?'\nEveryone was either completely listless or exuding an air of anxiety.\nIt was at that moment that a faint noise could be heard from outside the inn.\nIt was faint and far away, but since he was already focusing his senses, he picked it up.\nIl-mok, Jin Hayeon, and Jeong Hyeon exchanged glances and immediately left the inn to head to where the noise was coming from.\nThey stopped at some distance to be safe and what greeted Il-mok left him speechless.\nHow should he put it?\nIt was damn familiar to him.\n\"Please grant me salvation too!!\"\n\"Please, please help us!\"\n\"Yuanshi Tianzun!!\"\n(TL Note: One of the Three Pure Ones, basically one of the creators of the universe within Daoism)\nA group of Taoist priests was holding court in the market, and the entire town of zombies and nervous wrecks had suddenly transformed into a wailing, screaming mob of fanatics, all bowing down to them.\nThey were a textbook cult and its fanatics.\nAnd Il-mok couldn't help but glance over Jin Hayeon.\nToward Jin Hayeon.\nShe gave him a frosty look. \"...Is there something you'd like to say?\"\n\"Ahem. It's nothing.\" Il-mok said, quickly looking away.\nIt takes one to know one, and Il-mok instantly caught on to what’s going on.\n'These bastards aren't really from the Kongtong Sect. Hell, they're not even from any proper sect.'\nThey were fakes. Frauds. A rival cult.\nBut just because they weren't from Kongtong didn't mean all their problems were solved.\n'These bastards are seriously doing their business on someone else's turf?'\nIn a way, they were an even more dangerous enemies.\nIl-mok maintained some distance while observing that bizarre scene.\nHe wants to figure out exactly the methods those Taoist bastards used in their missionary work to drive people this crazy.\nAnd then he got his answer.\n\"Do not fear! Tonight, we will hold a gathering! Salvation will be granted to all!\"\nIl-mok's eyes lit up.\nThat night. Follow current novᴇls on NoveI-Fire.ɴet\nIl-mok and his party left their inn at the appointed time and gathered in one place.\nAnd not long after, people began leaving their homes all over the village and heading somewhere despite the late hour.\nFrom the shadows, Il-mok's crew uses the cover of darkness to tail the crowd.\nThey followed them out of town to a small hill just outside the county.\nIl-mok silently cursed.\n'Fucking hell.'\nThe people who had set out from all over Pingliang County were all converging on that hill.\nIt was clear that these fakers had managed to turn most of the town into brainwashed followers.\n'What the hell did they do?'\nHe was genuinely curious about their business methods.\nThey reached the clearing where the rally was being held, and soon, a few of the Taoists walked out.\n\"Thank you all for joining us tonight.\"\n\"Ohhhhh!\"\n\"Yuanshi Tianzun!\"\n\"Please grant us salvation!\"\nAt the heated cries of the cult fanatics, Il-mok's companions frowned.\n'What is this? Self-loathing among their own kind?'\nHe shook off the weird thought and focused on the stage.\nBut the bastards' sermon had no real substance.\nThey didn't even sing hymns like his group did, or show anything special that would captivate people.\nAs the meaningless sermon was winding down...\n\"We will now show you the paradise where Yuanshi Tianzun awaits you all.\"\nThe Taoist who'd been preaching up front said something bizarre.\n\"Ohhhhhh!\"\n\"Finally!!!\"\nThe fanatics, whose eyes were already rolling back, screamed even more fervently, and in that moment—\n\"!!!\"\nIl-mok sensed a bizarre energy flow and moved quickly,\n‘It’s a Formation!’\nThe energy around the gathering went haywire, and a massive Formation swallowed everyone inside.\nLuckily, everyone except Seon-ah had received Formation countermeasure training at the Hall of the Demonic Way, so no one panicked.\nThey all scrambled together into a tight group so they wouldn't get separated.\nAs for Seon-ah, Il-mok moved swiftly and was already standing guard with his hand on her shoulder.\n\"Thank you, Big Brother.\"\nThe girl blushed and spoke with deep emotion, but Il-mok's gaze was directed elsewhere.\n'Some kind of illusion Formation.'\nThe darkness of the night sky had disappeared, and beautiful scenery was now spread out around them.\n'Using Formation to scam people...'\nIt was a method even Il-mok hadn't thought of.\nRight then, whether it was an effect of the illusion or not, a hazy mist began enveloping the surroundings, and sensing something, Il-mok quickly covered Seon-ah's mouth and nose.\n—Circulate your internal energy and push out anything that enters when you breathe.\nHe could feel something... weird mixed in with the fog.\n‘Poison? No, that'd kill their entire audience. Unless... did they spot us? Are they trying to take out just our team?'\nWhile calculating various possibilities and assessing the situation, Il-mok felt Seon-ah circulating her internal energy and removed his hand from her mouth and nose.\nHe kept watching his surroundings for a while, just in case the bastards were using poison to specifically target them.\nAt some point, the mist finally faded away from the Formation and Il-mok finally could see what was going on. The county residents who’d been exposed to the mist began babbling in complete gibberish.\nThanks to that, Il-mok could easily figure out what was mixed into the mist.\n\"There's shit you should use and shit you shouldn't, you fatherless sons of bitches.”\nIl-mok's expression had already turned ice cold.",

    "content": "Chapter 213: Kongtong (4)\nIl-mok's face was ice cold as he gave orders to his group.\n\"Put on your masks.\"\nWithout a word, his team pulled out the masks they'd packed and strapped them on.\nEvery single one of them wore expressions of fury or cold anger.\nThey all understood just how twisted this rival cult really was.\nWhen they were ready, Il-mok started walking, his expression cold enough to freeze hell.\nHe'd been carefully observing the flow of energy ever since the Formation had first been deployed to memorize their pattern.\nHis natural talent for sensing qi, combined with what he'd learned back at the Hall of the Demonic Way, made it possible.\n'Compare the flow of energy felt from outside the Formation with the flow inside.'\nHe recalled the lessons from the Eight Trigram Hall’s elder who'd come as a temporary instructor and took the lead.\n'In an Illusory Dream Formation, the biggest danger is your own vision. You need to find your way using qi perception, not your eyes.'\nFollowing the path of least resistance in the Formation’s energy field, he pushed forward.\nThe drugged-up villagers were wandering around like zombies, but Il-mok just shoved them out of the way. They were so high on whatever was in the mist that they wouldn't remember a thing.\nBefore long, Il-mok came to a stop.\n'This is where the Formation's flow is most unstable.'\nThe Illusory Dream Formation laid out here wasn't meant to kill anyone in the first place.\nIt was just a trap to get people high and keep them from wandering off. It wasn't built like a maze; it didn't even have a proper Life Gate built into it.\nKnowing this, Il-mok had been searching from the start for the spot where the energy flow was most unstable.\n\"Haah!\"\nWith a sharp drawing motion, Il-mok's sword radiated a brilliant Sword Qi.\nZzzzrik!\nHis sword cut through empty air, but there was a sharp cracking sound, and a rift tore open in the energy field around them.\nTo Il-mok's super-sensitive qi perception, it looked like a pane of glass breaking apart.\nThe Illusory Dream Formation crumbled away, revealing the original low hill and night sky before his eyes.\n\"What the—!?\"\n\"Who the hell are you people!\"\nThe Taoist bastards who'd been keeping the villagers trapped in the Formation shouted in shock.\nThey’d spread themselves in the four cardinal directions to maintain the Formation.\nWhoosh!\nThe team saw their positions and split up instantly, each lunging for a target.\n\"How dare you disrupt our gathering!\"\n\"Kill them!\"\nShaking off their surprise, the Taoists started forming hand seals in the air or pulling out talismans to cast their spells.\nThe Taoist that Il-mok was targeting threw a handful of talismans that burst into flame, becoming fiery birds that came screaming toward him.\nIl-mok swung his sword with that same cold expression.\nNo fancy moves, just a few clean, efficient slashes. But the insight behind them was on another level.\nIn just three swings, all seven talismans were sliced cleanly apart.\nThanks to those efficient movements, Il-mok didn't slow down at all as he closed the distance right up to the fake Taoist's face.\n\"!!!\"\nThe bastard's eyes went wide with terror as he frantically moved his hands to form another seal, but—\nShwick!\nA wet slicing sound rang out and the Taoist’s hands hit the ground with a thud.\nShhhhaaaaa.\nA beat later, blood sprayed from his wrists like fountains.\n\"AAAAGHH!!\"\nThe Taoist finally screamed as the pain caught up with him.\nThud.\nBut Il-mok's expression remained indifferent as he flicked his hand, sealing the man's acupoints.\nHe hit the pressure points to shut him up and paralyze him, then hit two more on his wrists to stop the bleeding.\nAfter subduing one Taoist for interrogation, Il-mok turned his head to check on the others.\n\"Kugh...\"\nThe first thing he saw was a Taoist tangled up in black threads like a puppet on a string, unable to move.\nIt was Dam Bini’s handiwork.\nJin Hayeon and Seon-ah were also working together to corner their target, and Ouyang Mun and Ju Seo-yeon were doing the same.\nSwissssh!\nAn arrow shot by Jeong Hyeon pierced the leg of the Taoist who was being pursued by Ouyang Mun and Ju Seo-yeon.\n\"KYAAAGH!\"\nWith his leg disabled, the Taoist was finally captured and subdued by the two of them.\n\"P-please. S-spare me...\"\nNext was the Taoist who’d been hit by Jin Hayeon’s White Hand Demonic Art. His face went pale as he begged for his life.\nEven when the fake Taoists' voices were filled with agony and pleas, Il-mok couldn't feel even a shred of sympathy for them.\n\"Ehehehehe.\"\n\"Oh, Yuanshi Tianzun~\"\nTheir screams and pleas were nothing compared to the voices of all those people high on drugs that echoed from every direction.\nAfter subduing the Taoist bastards, they moved to a more distant location in case the drugged people woke up.\nIl-mok then ordered his companions to search through the bastards' belongings.\nThey found a bunch of magic trinkets and talismans, and one small bag of a mysterious powder.\nIl-mok took the bag and walked over to one of the subdued Taoists.\nThe man had been writhing in pain, but when he saw Il-mok coming with that bag, his face went white with fear.\nIl-mok's expression remained indifferent as he gave Jin Hayeon a look. She grabbed the priest's head, pried his jaw open, and Il-mok dumped the whole bag of powder down his throat.\nThe man who'd been groaning in pain suddenly had his eyes rolling back as his face flushed red and he started making bizarre expressions.\nIl-mok unblocked his vocal cords and asked his question.\n\"Why did you do this?\"\n\"Ghhhrrgghh.\"\nMaybe he'd given him too much; the bastard just frothed at the mouth and made gasping sounds.\n\"Tch.\"\nIl-mok gave the twitching Taoist a look of utter disgust, then walked over to the next one.\nCrack.\nHe stomped on the man's foot, shattering the bones in his toes. The Taoist’s eyes bugged out.\nWith his mute and paralyzed acupoint sealed, he couldn't even groan. After finally releasing his paralyzed acupoint, Il-mok asked again.\n\"Why did you do this?\"\nIt was the first question that came to mind after his head had cooled down a bit.\nGoing so far as to use drugs and a Formation to pose as cultists and cultivate fanatics...\nWhy would anyone go through so much trouble to turn ordinary citizens into cult fanatics?\nIf the goal was to take their money, the return on investment had to be terrible. He was sure that drugs weren’t cheap.\n\"T-to send them to paradise.\"\nIl-mok was about to respond to that garbage answer, but Dam Bin stepped up.\n\"I've handled a few of these before, Young Master. Let me.\"\nHer creepy vibe was back in full force now that she'd been in a fight.\nShe pulled a black thread from her sleeve and, with a pleasant smile, started sewing right through the Taoist's skin like she was doing needlework.\n\"Fufu. Don't worry, I know exactly where everything vital is. You won't die.\"\nUntil he gave a proper answer, her black thread kept punching new little holes in his body.\n\"KYAAAAAAGH!!\"\nAnd before long, the Taoist finally vomited out the truth.\n\"T-To use them as sacrifices!\"\n\"Sacrifices? What kind of sacrifices?\"\n\"F-for creating artifacts and Formations! H-human life force contains spiritual energy far more potent than any animal's blood. W-We have been extracting the l-lifeblood of those intoxicated by the drugs to create artifacts and F-formation.\"\n\"...You mean all those people back there?\"\n\"Th-they're just preparation. A-among those who've come to believe in paradise, we select a few from each gathering and p-process them at Mount Kongtong.\"\nThanks to the bastard's answer, Il-mok could piece together their general operation.\n\"You get them hooked on the drug, brainwash them with the illusion, and then you skim the best ones off the top with a promise of heaven. Then you take them to that mountain and bleed them dry. Until there's nothing left but a mummy.\"\nThese crazy bastards were treating Pingliang County like a livestock farm.\nIt was an act that would be utterly impossible if they saw the people of Pingliang as fellow human beings.\nAnd now they were getting greedy and looking to expand their operations.\nThe Taoist bastards who'd shown up in Dingxi County were proof of that.\n\"P-please spare me! I didn't want to do this either! It was all my Master's idea!\"\nThe Taoist couldn't take the pain anymore and threw his boss under the bus to save his own skin.\nAccording to the bastard's story, these men's master was an old Taoist known in the world as Guiguzi—the Ghost Valley Master.\nHe'd originally been a Taoist living on some nameless mountain in Shanxi Province, researching sorcery and Formations while teaching disciples.\nBut at some point, after hitting a wall in his cultivation, he gradually grew desperate and eventually crossed a line that should never be crossed.\nTo refine his sorcery and create better magical tools, he'd turned to human sacrifice. Follow current novᴇls on novel{f}ire.net\nAt first, he conducted human sacrifices in secret, and later, he used disciples who opposed him as sacrificial materials.\n\"I-I didn't want to do it either. I was just scared he'd use me as the next sacrifice if I didn't go along with it!\"\nHe kept making lame excuses, trying to make himself look like a victim.\nIl-mok thought it was a load of shit. He'd seen the way this guy looked at the townspeople.\nBut he needed information, so he decided to hear more of the story.\n\"So how did you end up coming here?\"\nThe story continued.\nOnce he got a taste for human sacrifice, he set up a permanent trap on their mountain to catch lost travelers.\nOf course, rumors started spreading that the mountain was haunted, and people stopped going there completely.\nAs if that wasn't enough, martial artists and other sorcerers who'd grown suspicious started frequently coming to investigate the mountain because of the rumors. Eventually, they had to leave the Ghost Valley behind and come here to Mount Kongtong.\nThis was due to a rumor that there was a great deal of \"prey\" that passed through Mount Kongtong.\nWhile they were setting up their new sacrificial altar and studying the local ley lines, one of the students found something.\nOne of his disciples discovered a place where a certain flower was growing.\nButterfly Dream Grass. It was a dangerous flower known to make those who inhaled its pollen experience hallucinations.\nAs expected from someone whose mind worked in twisted ways, the moment the Ghost Valley Master heard about the flower from his disciple, he came up with this exact scheme.\nA scheme to use the Illusory Dream Formation and flower pollen to cultivate fake cult followers to scam them and use them as sacrifices.\nThe faces of Il-mok and his party grew even colder as they learned just how horrific these bastards' actions had been.\nThe most important doctrine of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult was to punish evil for the sake of the masses.\n\"Including the Ghost Valley Master, how many more of you bastards are left at Mount Kongtong?\"\nIn their eyes, these people were trash that needed to be removed from this world immediately.\nAfter unsealing the mute acupoints of the other two Taoists, they interrogated all three to gather information on their strength and the Formations deployed at Mount Kongtong.\nJust to make sure they weren't lying, they even force-fed them some of their own drugs to loosen their tongues and cross-checked their stories.\nEven as they became wrecks from torture and writhed like worms while high on the Butterfly Dream Grass, no one felt any sympathy for them.\nCompared to what they'd been doing, this was nothing.\nOnce they had squeezed every last drop of intel out of them—\nIl-mok turned his head to look at Mount Kongtong, faintly visible in the moonlight.\nIt was supposed to be a holy mountain, but tonight it radiated an especially ominous atmosphere.\nBut even facing that ominous feeling, Il-mok moved forward without hesitation.\n\"Looks like we've got a lot of trash to take out tonight.\"\nSeven wrathful incarnations of Maitreya moved as one toward the mountain.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 214 : Kongtong (5)",
    "content": "Chapter 214: Kongtong (5)\nMount Kongtong was close enough to Pingliang County that you could practically see it from there. Then again, \"close\" means something different when you can travel as fast as martial artists of the Central Plains.\nIl-mok and his group used their lightness skill for about two hours before finally reaching the foot of Mount Kongtong.\nThey took turns standing guard at the mountain's entrance while recovering their internal energy through meditation, then headed into Mount Kongtong proper.\nFollowing the well-worn path left by countless travelers, they began their ascent. It wasn't long before they started feeling a powerful spiritual energy coming from the mountain itself.\nOnce they were about halfway up the mountain path.\n\"I'll scout ahead.\"\nDam Bin announced her departure before using her stealth techniques to melt into the shadows.\nAbout fifteen minutes later, she returned.\nWith her leading the way, they started climbing again. Before long, they spotted a grand gate with a sign that read [Kongtong Sect].\nJust as the scammers claimed, they had brazenly established themselves on the mountainside of Kongtong.\nAnd right in front of that gate lay a Taoist sprawled on the ground, apparently sleeping.\nDam Bin walked past the sleeping priest without a care, heading straight for the Kongtong Sect compound. The rest of the group followed her lead.\nOnly when they passed by the sleeping Taoist did they notice the small hole pierced through his body and the blood that had trickled out.\nThis was Dam Bin’s handiwork from her little scouting trip.\n\"How many were there?\"\nAt Il-mok's question, Dam Bin flashed a bewitching smile.\n\"Three more inside, Young Master.\"\nHe figured those three had probably been sent to the afterlife before they even knew what hit them.\nBut something was off. The Kongtong Sect was a huge place, with more than ten different buildings. It was way too big for just four people. Even counting the guys from Pingliang County, it was an awful lot of space for only eight of them.\nBut Il-mok and his group didn't find it particularly suspicious.\nAfter all, it matched what they'd heard from torturing those Taoist bastards back in Pingliang County.\nThey moved without hesitation, walking past the sect's buildings and heading straight into the dense woods behind them.\nAfter pushing through dense underbrush thick with sacred energy, they hit a dead end.\nIt was a cliff.\nWheeeeeee!\nThe cliff echoed with a ghastly wind that sounded like screaming demons.\nThen, Dam Bin launched herself off the edge without hesitation; her falling body plummeted out of sight.\nDespite the horrifying sight, the rest of the group followed one after another without a moment's hesitation.\nWhoosh.\nAfter Il-mok jumped last, something incredible happened.\nThe cliff that had filled his entire field of vision vanished without a trace. The ominous atmosphere, the demon-like screaming, and the wind all disappeared.\nThe cliff, the dense woods, and the howling wind had all been one big illusion created by the Formation set up by these bastards disguised as the Kongtong Sect.\nThose bastards had used the Formation to hide the place where they performed their human sacrifices while acting like perfectly normal Taoists to the outside world.\n\"This is where it gets dangerous. Stay sharp.\"\nIl-mok surveyed the dense thicket now spread before them.\n‘These crazy fuckers... just how many people have they killed?’\nDespite Mount Kongtong's reputation as a sacred peak, it was overflowing with sinister energy and ghostly qi.\nEveryone Seon-ah had completed their training at the Hall of the Demonic Way, which meant they'd all learned how to deal with Formations.\nMore precisely, they'd learned how to counter them.\nAnd through the temporary instructor dispatched from the Eight Trigrams Hall, they knew one thing very well:\nWalking into a trap set by Shamans or Taoists was practically suicide.\nThe one saving grace was that Il-mok and his group had come somewhat prepared.\nAfter torturing the four priests they'd captured, they'd obtained information about the Formation set up here.\nSince those Taoist bastards had to bring their civilian victims here as sacrifices, there had to be a Life Gate inside.\nIl-mok and his group followed that very path.\nWheeeeeee.\nThe veteran of the group, Dam Bin, led from the front, while Il-mok brought up the rear in case of emergencies.\nIt wasn't that he was trying to stick the others with the dangerous job. It was because he had the sharpest qi perception of them all. From the back, he could keep an eye on everyone and be ready for anything.\n\"Miss Jeong, be careful.\"\nWalking right in front of Il-mok, Jeong Hyeon jumped at the sound of his voice and bowed her head.\n\"I-I'm sorry.\"\n\"No need to be so tense. There's plenty of sinister energy and ghostly qi, but as long as we don't stray from the Life Gate, we'll be fine.\"\nIl-mok meant to comfort her, but it wasn't the creepy vibe that was making her so stiff.\nThe Formation made this place dangerous, so everyone had to stick close together, and that's what had her all stiff.\n‘At least... at least that last mission helped a little.’\nThe mission she was thinking of was 'Operation Jade-Faced Young Master.'\nIt had involved her dressing up as a man and getting mobbed by women. Over and over again.\nAfter surviving a few brushes with Qi Deviation and her own Heart Demon, she'd gotten a tiny bit more used to having people in her personal space.\nWhich meant her face was deathly pale and she was sweating buckets, but at least she wasn't passing out anymore.\nEven after that, Il-mok kept watch from the rear to make sure no one strayed from the Life Gate or took a wrong step.\n\"Miss Ju, focus.\"\n\"Seon-ah, be careful.\"\nWhile Il-mok looked after everyone from the back, Dam Bin at the front used the information from those Taoist bastards to find the safe path forward.\nEven under the crushing pressure akin to walking on thin ice, she calmly led the group.\nThe moment she took the final step, she heard from the Taoists, the dense thicket that had filled their surroundings until a moment ago, along with the ghostly qi and the spectral wails, vanished without a trace.\n\"Hm? You're back earlier than I expected.\"\nJust then, someone spoke to her.\nIt was one of the Ghost Valley Master's disciples.\nHe'd mistaken Dam Bin for an ally.\nPart of it was that she'd walked right through the Formation's unharmed, but the bigger reason was her clothes.\nTo be safe, Dam Bin and three others in the group had stolen the Taoists' robes.\nOf course, Il-mok was too much of a clean freak to wear someone's hand-me-downs, especially if they were stained with blood.\nSince it was late at night, the Taoist had momentarily mistaken Dam Bin for a fellow disciple, but soon his brow furrowed.\nHe'd belatedly noticed her qi was different from his fellow disciples.\n\"Who the hell—\"\nHe tried to shout, probably to call for his fellow disciples, but—\n\"Kugh...\"\n—He never got the chance. Before he could finish, a black thread shot out from Dam Bin and ran him through the throat and heart.\nAfter quickly taking care of the Taoist, a refreshed smile spread across Dam Bin's face.\n\"Fufufu. This is far more comfortable.\"\nNo matter how seasoned she was, leading the party inside a deadly Formation had been seriously stressful.\nAssassinating people like this was much more her style.\nAfter taking care of the guard, she quickly moved aside to let the rest of the group trickle out from the Formation one by one.\nIl-mok came out last, took one look at the threaded-up Taoist on the ground, and knew exactly what had happened.\n\"Any more delays and they'll know we're here. We're going in now.\"\nThey stepped past the body and were immediately confronted by a strange sight.\nA ritual altar carved with grotesque patterns stood at the center, surrounded by about fifteen Taoists.\nWhile the Pingliang County Taoists had gone out to find sacrifices, this bunch was getting ready for the ritual.\nAmong them, Il-mok's eyes turned ice-cold when he spotted the old priest at the altar's center, holding a sharp sword.\n‘So that's the Ghost Valley Master.’\nThe master and leader of these fake Taoists.\nThe Ghost Valley Master also noticed Il-mok and his group and frowned.\n\"Tch. What a shame. Annoying little flies are already buzzing around.\"\nWith that, the old Taoist pointed his sacrificial sword at Il-mok's crew and gave the order.\n\"Get rid of them.\"\nThe second he gave the command, his disciples started weaving hand signs or pulling talismans and other magical trinkets from their sleeves.\nWhoosh!\nAt the same instant, Il-mok and his group launched themselves at the Taoists with their lightness skills.\nWhen Il-mok swung his sword at the air, the Sword Qi gathered on his blade shot forward, cutting through space toward the nearest priest.\nThe startled Taoist hurriedly shoved a talisman forward while chanting an incantation. The paper went rigid, and a shimmering energy shield appeared in front of him.\nBOOM!\nThe Sword Qi and barrier collided, the two forces canceling each other out.\nWHOOSH!\nBut right behind it, an arrow from Jeong Hyeon zipped past her friends, heading for the same guy.\nThunk!\nThe arrow embedded itself right in the forehead of the Taoist who'd created the barrier.\n\"Kugh...\"\nJust like that, the front-line Taoist died a pathetic death.\n\"Die!\"\nWith the enraged shouts of the other Taoists, storms of spells were heading toward Il-mok's group.\nA bundle of talismans covered in blood-red writing transformed into flaming birds and flew at them, while lightning burst forth when someone swung a staff stained blood-red.\nFaced with their bizarre sorcery, Il-mok flared his Sword Qi and swung his sword wide, forming a sword barrier.\nJin Hayeon beside him channeled her yin qi into both palms and swept them in a wide circle to create an ice wall.\n\"Hah!\"\nAs for Ouyang Mun, he unleashed his refreshingly straightforward saber techniques, slicing through the fire birds coming at him one after another.\nThough the three at the front blocked most of the sorcery, a few spells slipped past them toward the rear.\nThey were targeting Jeong Hyeon, who'd just killed a priest with her arrow.\n\"Hah!\"\nBut Hyeokryeon Seon-ah and Ju Seo-yeon quickly swung their claw and spear to block the attacks.\nWHOOSH!\nMeanwhile, another arrow from Jeong Hyeon pierced straight through another Taoist's heart.\nAnd that wasn't all.\nCrack.\nBlack threads shot by Dam Bin had already pierced through yet another priest's vital points.\nThanks to Jeong Hyeon and Dam Bin's covering fire, Il-mok, Jin Hayeon, and Ouyang Mun could push forward much more easily.\nCrack!\nWatching his disciples die one after another right before his eyes, the Ghost Valley Master frowned again.\nBut he wasn't sad to see them die.\n'Tch. What a waste of good minions.'\nHe just felt annoyed that he'd have to train new slaves to handle the menial work.\n\"Useless vermin. But you'll have one last use before you die.\"\nWhile his disciples were dying around him, the Ghost Valley Master muttered something incomprehensible and thrusted the sacrificial sword he was holding right into the heart of the disciple standing next to him.\nShunk.\nHit by an unexpected strike, the disciple collapsed with a face full of questions.\nThe blood spurting from his pierced heart began soaking the center of the altar.\nThe Ghost Valley Master then plunged the blood-stained sacrificial sword into the altar's center and chanted an incantation.\n\"By the command of the law!\"\nAt that moment, the altar began absorbing the blood on the sword and the blood spurting from his disciple's heart.\nThe Ghost Valley Master's true plan. He had been secretly building a backup formation this whole time, hiding it even from his own disciples.\nSince it wasn't complete yet, the blood of a single man wasn't nearly enough to power it up. But he didn't care.\nAfter all, the bleeding disciple he'd stabbed wasn't the only one.\nBlood from the disciples killed by Il-mok's group also got sucked into the grooves carved into the altar. Updates are released by n0velfire.net\nIt wasn't just flowing; the altar greedily devoured the blood like a living creature.\n\"That crazy bastard...\"\nThe curse slipped out of Il-mok's mouth as he watched the grotesque scene unfold.\nBOOOOOOM!!\nAnd in that instant, a colossal, malevolent crimson energy erupted, consuming everything and everyone in its path.",

    "content": "Chapter 215: Kongtong (6)\nThe moment that ominous energy burst out from the altar, Il-mok quickly formed a sword barrier to block it.\nWhiiiiing.\nThe energy that crashed into Il-mok's sword barrier dissipated, but what he managed to eliminate was only a tiny fraction.\nThe same went for everyone else.\nJin Hayeon's ice arts and Ouyang Mun's saber techniques managed to cancel out bits and pieces of the wave, but most of it simply washed past them and kept going.\nThe energy fanned out in every direction and mixed with the mountain's own sacred power, creating a massive prison.\nThough Il-mok was no expert in sorcery, his exceptional qi perception allowed him to instinctively realize one thing.\n'There is no Life Gate.'\nA Formation with no way out. Of course, he could understand that much.\nIf it was meant to trap someone, having no escape route was actually pretty logical.\nWhat puzzled Il-mok was something else entirely.\n'What is that lunatic planning?'\nBecause Ghost Valley Master was trapped in the Formation too.\nAnd he was standing right in the center of the altar, the very core of the Formation.\nJust then, a bizarre change occurred within the Formation that was churning with ghostly qi.\nThe twisted energy began to condense in one place, then rapidly took on a distinct form.\nThe shape of a human.\nNo, they were human, yet their forms were somehow grotesque.\nSome had limbs bent at impossible angles, while others were just dripping with blood.\n\"My blood! Give me back my blood!!\"\n\"Send me to paradise!!\"\nThese bizarre entities suddenly appeared from thin air and shrieked like they were screaming in agony as they attacked Il-mok and his group.\n'Are they illusions?'\nThat was his first thought, but he wasn't about to bet his life on it.\nThe concentration of malevolent energy flowing through the entire Formation was too thick. Whatever these things were, they weren't just simple phantoms.\nClang!\nAfter blocking an attack from one of these unidentifiable monsters wreathed in red energy, Il-mok used the principle of redirection to deflect its arm and simply cut off its head.\n\"Kyaaaaaaah!!\"\nThe monster whose head was grotesquely severed screamed as a geyser of \"blood\" shot from its mouth.\nExcept it wasn't blood, it was just pure red energy.\nClang!!\n\"Kugh.\"\nIl-mok barely managed to block that blood-colored energy. With that final attack, the monster dissolved into thin air.\nBut things weren't getting any easier.\nFor every monster Il-mok cut down, the Formation's thick energy was clumping together and spewing out new monsters.\n\"Watch out, Hayeon!\"\nOuyang Mun, who'd managed to take down a monster, shouted as he blocked the coordinated attack of two monsters that had suddenly appeared on both sides.\n\"Noisy.\"\nThat was Jin Hayeon's cold reply as she used her ice powers to handle her own pincer attack.\nThe women in the rear weren't faring much better.\nWith their numbers growing by the second, Ju Seo-yeon was frantically executing her already dizzying spear art at a pace that made her head spin.\n\"Eeek!\"\nHyeokryeon Seolnah was tangled up fighting two monsters, and since she fought with the same kind of blood-red energy they had, the whole mess looked like three monsters tearing each other apart.\nAs monsters spawned from all directions—\n\"Hiiik.\"\nOne materialized right in Jeong Hyeon's face, causing her to retaliate with an arrow despite her spooked face.\nThunk!\nThe monster twisted its body just in time, so the arrow lodged in its shoulder instead of its head.\n\"Kyaaaaaaah!!\"\nIgnoring the arrow sticking out of its body like it was nothing, the monster lunged right for her. The situation in the back was suddenly even more dangerous than it was for the fighters up front.\n\"Hah!\"\nSeeing the endless horde, Dam Bin swung both hands in succession.\nA storm of black threads erupted from her sleeves, weaving through the air like an intricate dance controlled by her fingertips.\nPAPAPAPAK!\nA flurry of sharp sounds rang out as more than half her threads found their marks, piercing deep into the monsters.\nBut since these weren't human, hitting their vital points didn't stop them.\nSeeing that, a chilling and bewitching smile spread across Dam Bin's face.\nShe strongly gripped the myriad outstretched threads with both hands, and the moment she violently pulled her arms apart—\nKRRRRRRR-TCH!\nThe threads embedded in the monsters' bodies suddenly went taut, acting like a thousand tiny blades that sliced them apart from the inside out.\n\"Kyeeeeeek!!\"\nThe shredded monsters screamed their ghostly death rattles and vanished, only for a fresh wave to pop up instantly.\n\"Blood!! Give me back my blood!!\"\nThanks to the monsters’ screams, something clicked in Il-mok's head.\n'Don't tell me... these are the ghosts of the people they sacrificed here.'\nBut even figuring that out didn't really change anything.\nFor some reason, the spirits weren't going after the Taoists who'd murdered them. They were following their orders.\nNo, wait. That wasn't right.\nCrunch.\n\"Kueeeok...\"\nThe surviving Taoists were also getting their bodies pierced by those vengeful spirits' attacks.\nAnd the blood flowing from their wounds was being absorbed back into the altar, adding to the Formation's malevolent energy.\nThere was only one person the vengeful spirits weren't targeting.\nThe Ghost Valley Master who is standing in the center of the altar. ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ N()velFire.net\nDam Bin caught on to this fact just as quickly as Il-mok, and boldly shot a single thread at Ghost Valley Master right after executing a major technique.\nThe thread that traveled a distance rippled with sharp energy similar to Sword Qi, but—\nSCREEECH!!\nIt scraped against something with a nasty shriek and then fell dead in the air.\n\"Hehehehe. You think this pathetic technique can pierce my Ink Blood Steel Tablet?\"\nGhost Valley Master was now holding out a dark red wooden tablet, and blood-colored energy rippling from that tablet was enveloping him.\nIt was a magical artifact created by Ghost Valley Master, who valued his own safety above all else. He had forged it from the life force of the countless people he’d sacrificed here.\nActually, it was something he'd been creating and strengthening since the days of human sacrifices at Ghost Valley Mountain.\n\"You'll never escape this Dead Spirit Blood Demon Formation.\"\nAt Ghost Valley Master's shout, which sounded almost like a curse, Il-mok scowled.\n'Damn it.'\nHe knew this was going to be a real mess.\n'He's just going to hide behind that shield of his and wait for the spirits to tear us apart.'\nWith his keen qi perception, Il-mok had noticed something. These vengeful spirits couldn't spawn infinitely.\nHe'd felt the foul energy in the air dip just a little when Dam Bin took out that big group. But the dip was tiny, and the energy had shot right back up the second the other Taoist bastards started dying.\nWorse, he realized it wasn't just death that refueled it. Any blood they spilled was being used as fuel.\nThe amount of malevolent energy flowing within the Formation was still overflowing, so trying to hold out until all that energy ran out would be a guaranteed loss.\nFiguring all this out in a split second, Il-mok started shouting orders.\n\"Squad Leader Dam Bin! Keep the others safe in the back! Miss Jin, Young Warrior Ouyang, I need cover!\"\nAfter shouting that, Il-mok cut down a monster screaming right in front of him and launched himself toward Ghost Valley Master.\nInstead of waiting for the Formation's energy to run out, he'd decided to target Ghost Valley Master directly.\nHe became a blur of motion, his sword flashing out again and again while maximizing the principle of swift swordsmanship, and the vengeful spirits blocking his path were instantly torn into pieces.\nIn a heartbeat, he'd carved a path and used his speed to appear right in front of Ghost Valley Master.\n\"Haaaah!\"\nHe put all his power into the swing, and the Sword Qi around his blade solidified into pure Sword Force.\nBOOM!!!\nThe Sword Force Il-mok unleashed clashed with the blood-colored barrier with a deafening roar.\nBut Il-mok's expression after swinging his sword wasn't great.\nSurprisingly, the blood-colored energy barrier didn't disappear despite clashing with the Sword Force.\nIt just flickered unstably with cracks forming in it.\nBut even those cracks disappeared quickly.\nEnergy flowing from Ghost Valley Master's body was sucked into the tablet, instantly repairing the cracks.\nLike a tug-of-war, the Sword Force on Il-mok's sword and the blood-colored barrier created by the tablet pushed against each other for a moment.\n\"Kyeeeeeek!\"\n\"Blood! Hand over your blood!!\"\nBefore long, new vengeful spirits materialized by the Dead Spirit Blood Demon Formation and began rushing toward Il-mok.\nBut Il-mok didn't twist his sword path to strike at the vengeful spirits.\nHe just silently kept his sword pressed against the blood-colored energy.\nHe was counting on Jin Hayeon and Ouyang Mun to have his back.\nSwoosh!\nThwack!\nAnd they did.\nOuyang Mun's swift blade and Jin Hayeon's freezing cold palms flew toward the vengeful spirit trying to attack Il-mok, and the two who'd landed on the ground used their lightness skills to position themselves on the left and right behind Il-mok.\n\"Brilliant move, Hayeon!\"\n\"Shut up.\"\nJin Hayeon shot back, ignoring his pointless chatter as she calmly stared down the next wave.\nBehind her, Il-mok's Sword Force and Ghost Valley Master's blood-colored barrier were struggling against each other, constantly creating explosive sounds, but she paid no mind to the events at her back.\n'If it's Young Master Il-mok, he'll find a way to handle it.'\nHer faith in him was absolute, second only to her faith in the Heavenly Demon himself.\nThough his occasional displays of laziness were a slight concern, there was not even a shred of doubt about his ability and talent.\nHowever, as someone who served him, it wouldn't be right to leave everything to the person she served.\n'My job is to make sure nothing distracts him.'\nAs her mind became perfectly calm, the icy energy deep in her dantian surged through her body and gathered in her palms.\n\"Kyeeeeeek!!\"\nAs vengeful spirits rushed toward her—\nShe simply kept her palms pressed together, condensing the energy flowing from her dantian.\nAnd the moment the closest vengeful spirit swung its blood-energy-wreathed claws at her—\nTssssshk.\nWith a strange sound, her palms that had been pressed together in a prayer-like gesture separated.\nTsssshk.\nIn a place filled with ghostly wail, a breathtakingly beautiful dance began.\nFollowing her slow but unceasing movements, countless ice flowers embroidered the air along her palms.\nThe crimson energy of the Formation, the eerie moonlight filtering through clouds of blood, it all mixed with the shimmering frost, painting the cavern in strange colors.\n\"Kyeeeeeek...\"\nThe vengeful spirits that touched the ice flowers created by her White Hand Demonic Art screamed as they froze solid.\nShe had created a deadly garden of icy thorns, a wall that would stop anyone who dared to threaten her master.\nFrigid yin qi leaked from her as she sighed.\n\"Phew.\"\nJust then, a strained voice spoke up from right next to her.\n\"Ahem. H-Hey, a heads-up would've been nice, Hayeon.\"\nIt was Ouyang Mun's voice.\nHe'd nearly frozen solid along with those vengeful spirits.\nHe'd survived only because he'd swung his saber like a madman, barely managing to deflect a few ice flowers flying toward him.\nIn response to his whining, Jin Hayeon just clicked her tongue.\n\"Tsk.\" [! ] ]",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 216 : Kongtong (7)",
    "content": "Chapter 216: Kongtong (7)\nJin Hayeon added, as if she wasn't particularly bothered by failing to kill Ouyang Mun.\n\"Less talking, use that saber more.\"\nHer jab just made Ouyang Mun laugh cheerfully.\n\"Hahaha! Since you've frozen them, Hayeon, I'll handle the cleanup!\"\nAs he swung his saber toward the vengeful spirits slowed by her ice art, Ouyang Mun thought to himself.\nSlash!\nMan, with chemistry like this, we are totally soulmates.\nWhile Ouyang Mun was off in his own little world, Jin Hayeon was calmly scanning the area.\n'There's really no end to them.'\nFor every wraith she froze and Ouyang Mun diligently chopped to pieces, the Dead Spirit Blood Demon Formation spat out new ones.\nBut she wasn't worried or discouraged.\n\"Huuu.\"\nShe took a deep breath to stabilize her internal energy and pull up more of her internal energy from her dantian once more.\nShe had an absolute faith in the man fighting right behind her.\nKABOOM!!\nThe air roared as Il-mok's sword continued to clash against the blood-colored barrier.\nWatching Il-mok suppress the blood barrier with his Sword Force, the Ghost Valley Master let out a mocking laugh.\n\"Hehehehe. What a foolish whelp. If you'd used that strength to fight the blood demons instead of targeting me, you might've at least had a chance of lasting until the end.\"\nThough Ghost Valley Master was mocking him, he was also constantly pouring energy into his tablet without rest, but he looked more relaxed than Il-mok.\nIt was the composure you get when you're more experienced and have been stockpiling power from countless human sacrifices.\nIl-mok just clicked his tongue at the old man's taunt.\n\"Tch.\"\nIt pissed him off, but he had to admit that son of a bitch had a point.\nEven at this moment, Ouyang Mun and Jin Hayeon were fighting the vengeful spirits to protect him.\nThe same went for those fighting in the rear.\nBecause Il-mok was tied up in this power struggle with Ghost Valley Master, they were short one fighter, making everyone else's job that much harder.\nStill, Il-mok didn't regret his choice.\nJust as the son of a bitch said, they might be able to hold out until the Formation's energy was depleted. But if they did that, some of his companions would definitely die.\n'I will never let what happened that day repeat itself.'\nHis mind flashed back to the Hall of the Demonic Way. On the day they were ambushed by the fanatics.\nBut the hard truth was that a stupid shoving match wasn't going to work either.\nIl-mok pulled back his sword and calmed his demonic energy with a deep breath.\n\"Huuu.\"\nHe gave up on the head-on approach and started testing the shield and striking different places to find a weak point.\nBut no matter where he aimed, the results were similar.\nAll he got was a nasty scraping sound or a dull thud. The shield didn't even crack.\nThe reason there were no thunderous booms was that Il-mok's sword wasn't wrapped in Sword Force.\nEven with the boost from that thousand-year-old herb, he hadn't achieved Transcendence in his Demonic Art yet, so he couldn't just spam Sword Force however he pleases.\nAnd unfortunately, Sword Qi alone wasn't enough to create even the smallest crack in the barrier.\n'The power is spread out evenly.’\nThe blood barrier that the Ghost Valley Master had created was spherical in shape, boasting uniform strength in all directions.\nOnce he realized this, Il-mok lowered his sword and observed the barrier with calm eyes.\n\"Hahaha. Giving up so soon?\"\nThe Ghost Valley Master's mockery pierced Il-mok's ears, but he paid it no mind.\nIl-mok was focused entirely on a single problem.\n'I have to hit it harder.'\nHe needed one perfect strike. One attack that could shatter it.\nWasting energy on more failed attempts would mean he'd be too weak when the real chance came.\nSo Il-mok lowered his sword and poured all his concentration into that one problem.\nBut the topic was far too abstract.\n'What does 'strong' even mean?'\nTo find the answer to that abstract problem, Il-mok willingly closed his eyes and sank deep into his mental realm.\n\"KIEEEEEEK!\"\nHe did this despite the continuous shrieks of the vengeful spirits and the malevolent energy flowing from all directions.\nJust as his party believed that Il-mok would deal with the Ghost Valley Master, Il-mok also trusted those protecting him.\nDeep inside Il-mok’s mind.\n—Just hit it with everything you've got, you idiot!\n—Make a denser Sword Force! Use every last bit of your innate life force if you have to!\nThe side effect that was now smaller than before screamed its head off as it watched Il-mok trying to find enlightenment.\nIl-mok ignored the side effect's cries and raised his right hand. Within his raised right hand, a sword appeared.\nThere, in his mind, he started practicing the forms of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword as if learning it from scratch all over again.\n'The forms that emphasize the principle of strength are... the Soul-Crushing Sword, and the Shadow-Suppressing Strike. And from the latter forms...'\nAfter executing several forms emphasizing the principle of strength, Il-mok's movements transitioned to other forms.\n'Is just being strong really the point? If I need to cut it, wouldn't it be better to use a technique like the Northern Wind Soul-Severing Strike?'\nAs he moved from one form to another, he mixed multiple principles into his movements and moved toward a fundamental question.\n'That boar Dokgo Pae used his sword this way.'\nBefore he knew it, Il-mok had moved beyond the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword and was mixing in other sword and saber arts as well.\nDokgo Pae's Nine Swords of Dokgo. Eldest Brother's Raging Demon Sword Art and other domineering martial arts.\nThough he didn't know the specific mnemonics and formulas, he'd seen them enough to copy the basic forms and, more importantly, the intents behind each Demonic Art.\nHe didn’t know how long he danced with his sword.\n‘Strength isn’t just about swinging your sword as hard as you can. Strength can also be created through speed, and it can even be realized through softness.’\nSwinging faster naturally made it stronger, and swinging smoothly with elastic force also made it stronger.\nAnd this wasn't just limited to the body.\n'The same goes for Qi.'\nHe'd already learned to apply different principles to his regular Sword Qi, so why not to his higher-level Sword Force?\nGranted, the difference between the two was night and day.\nJust creating Sword Force took an incredible amount of focus and mental power, drawing on everything he'd learned.\nBut now that he had a glimpse of the realm he had to reach, Il-mok decided to go all out and drew up his internal energy.\nFollowing his will, a massive surge of internal energy poured from his dantian and raced through his meridians.\nEmerging from the depths of his mindscape, Il-mok's eyes flashed open.\n'What is he doing?'\nThe Ghost Valley Master stared at the intruder standing before him with closed eyes and fell into contemplation.\nHe looked far too defenseless.\n'Maybe I should just take him out right now...'\nThat thought kept rising, but the Ghost Valley Master couldn't bring himself to try it.\nIt wasn’t just because of the two lovebirds fighting so hard to protect him.\nIt’s also because the distance between that defenseless bastard and himself was too close.\nThe Ink Blood Steel Tablet was a magical tool that perfectly blocked attacks from outside to inside, but it also perfectly blocked energy flowing from inside to outside.\nIn other words, for the Ghost Valley Master to attack Il-mok, he'd have to lower the blood barrier.\n'Maybe it's a trap to deceive me.'\nIf he dropped his shield this close to a master of Il-mok's level, he'd probably get his head lopped off before he could even chant the first word of a spell.\nSo the Ghost Valley Master kept agonizing over whether to stay put or lower the barrier and attack, but...\nNearly half an hour had passed since the bastard closed his eyes. Even that worry had gone now.\n\"Hehehehe. Thanks to you standing there like an idiot, all your companions will become blood demons too.\"\nIn the span of that half an hour, the intruders who had charged in here had slaughtered countless blood demons.\nThanks to that, the ghostly qi that had filled the Formation had also been depleted by nearly half.\n\"Seuup. Huuu.\"\n\"Huk. Huk.\"\nBut the problem was, the intruders who'd been in constant combat with the blood demons were also breathing quite roughly now.\nThe two lovebirds who'd been constantly scattering Saber Qi and creating ice flowers had been fighting while conserving their strength as much as possible for a while now.\nIt wasn't some clever new tactic. It was a desperate move because they were running on fumes.\nThe folks in the back weren't seriously hurt, but they were covered in cuts and scrapes.\nEven the deadly woman with the thread attacks was starting to look drained.\nAs their wounds pile up, the formation's energy will recover through their blood, so now all he had to do was hold out here.\nJust as the Ghost Valley Master reached that conclusion—\nFlash.\nIl-mok's eyes opened.\nFollowing the insight he'd glimpsed beyond the wall, Il-mok thrust his sword forward.\nRelease of Tension (脫力).\nLike a puppet with cut strings, all strength vanished from his body, then all the vanished strength was channelled to his sword to form the most perfect path for the sword to strike.\nFollowing the principle of softness, his body acted like a whip. The force started at his toes, snapped up through his legs and hips, and amplified all the way to his wrist.\nAnd by the time it reached the final motion, the strike was charged with twice his usual power. Thɪs chapter is updatᴇd by novel✦fire.net\nAnd it wasn't limited to just his physical movement.\nIn tune with his body's movements, the demonic energy of the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword also raced through his meridians.\nIt wasn't just following a set path anymore; at times it flowed softly, at times it was strong, and at times it was fast.\nWhen the endlessly amplified power of internal and external arts reached its peak, an even more condensed Sword Force blazed from Il-mok's sword tip.\n'Sword Force isn't just about creating it and calling it done!'\nWith his focus at its absolute sharpest, he infused that energy with the pure principle of Strength.\nBOOOOOOM!!!\nA thunderous roar echoed as Il-mok's sword tip clashed with the blood barrier.\n'This can't be!?'\nThe Ghost Valle Master stared in horror as massive cracks began to spread across the blood barrier like a cracked eggshell. He scrambled to pour more power into it to fix the damage, but—\nSHRRIIIIIEK!\nAt some point, Il-mok was already swinging a second strike.\nIt was a movement that applied a fragment of the enlightenment he had just obtained.\nHe'd returned the rebound force from clashing with the barrier using the principle of Softness to unleash a faster strike than usual.\nMaybe it was the strain of using a technique he wasn't ready for, or maybe it was just the force of the impact, Il-mok's face had become a mess with blood flowing from his seven orifices.\nCRACK!!\nBut the second strike Il-mok unleashed finally succeeded in piercing through the blood barrier.\nCLANG!\nBut the impact was too much, and Il-mok's sword exploded into pieces. It had already been damaged from hitting the barrier so many times. His internal energy was a chaotic mess, and his brain felt like it was frying from the strain of using power he couldn't fully control.\nYet Il-mok dismissed the pain and took one step forward.\nWithin that world of pain, his concentration peaked, and the world slowed.\nHe could feel the raw panic in the Ghost Valley Master's eyes. He saw the old man toss aside his broken tablet and start to weave a hand sign, all in perfect slow motion.\nWhy was it happening?\nWhile the Ghost Valley Master and everything else moved slowly.\nIl-mok's own energy was moving at full speed, flowing through him and pooling in his hand.\nLike wielding a sword, Il-mok's left hand formed a hand sword of pure qi and carved a single, perfect line through the frozen world.\n\" Cough .\"\nThe moment the blow was finished, his chaotic energy erupted, and he coughed up a spray of blood. Finally, the slowed world returned to normal.\nSlash.\nA fraction of a second later, the sound of the cut finally arrived, and the Ghost Valley Master's head started to tumble from his shoulders.\nHis eyes hadn't even registered his own death.

    "content": "Chapter 217: Kongtong (8)\nWhile his internal energy churned violently and a splitting headache threatened to crack his skull open—\n—Hehehe. All thanks to my teachings.\nIl-mok inwardly rolled his eyes at the Soul-Stealing Heartless Sword’s bullshit as he forced himself to move forward.\n'Teachings your mom ass.'\nAll it had told him to do was stupidly dump all his power into one hit. How the hell was that teaching?\n'Useless bastard.'\n—...\nIl-mok got this weird feeling that the side effect in his head was sulking, but he shut it out completely.\nHe felt like he was about to drop dead as it was; he had no spare attention to waste on some crazy bastard.\nThe place Il-mok headed after barely managing to walk was in front of Ghost Valley Master's corpse.\nTo be precise, it was the sacrificial sword embedded in the center of the altar before the corpse.\nEven though Ghost Valley Master was dead, the Formation still hadn't deactivated.\nIl-mok grabbed the handle of that sword stuck in the altar with both hands and, with a strained grunt, wrenched it free.\n\"Hngh.\"\nIt felt like he was trying to pull the sword out of the jaws of some ravenous beast. He had to force his churning internal energy to flare up just to get it loose.\nSssshhhk.\nThe moment it came free, the foul energy cage around them shattered, and the spirits let out one last, agonizing scream before fading away.\n'Killing these fucking scammers probably won't settle your grudges completely, but I hope you can rest in peace now.'\nHe watched them fade with a bitter look on his face.\n'Wait... am I seeing things?'\nJust before the spirits disappeared, Il-mok caught sight of something. The spirit faces, once filled with rage and madness, seemed to show peaceful smiles.\nIt might have been an illusion, but seeing them look like they'd released even a bit of their resentment made Il-mok feel more at ease.\n\"Phew.\"\nWith a sigh of relief, Il-mok dropped into a meditative stance and started trying to get his energy back under control.\nIf he delayed any longer, he'd really fall into Qi Deviation.\nThe moment Il-mok began his meditation, the Demonic Art bastard who'd been keeping his trap shut for a bit started acting up again.\n—You filthy wretch! How can you sit down in a place drenched in blood?!\n—Clean up this filthy world!!\nIl-mok was certain now.\n'Yep, it’s definitely sulking.' Thɪs chapter is updated by novel-fire.net\nThis dog-like bastard was throwing a tantrum at the absolute worst possible moment.\nWhich was just great, since his head was already spinning and he felt like he was going to puke.\n'SHUT THE FUCK UP!!'\nAfter snapping at the side effect, Il-mok kept one part of his consciousness fixed on that bastard in his mental world like a hawk, while carefully circulating his internal energy with the other part.\nBut he quickly realized this was way too risky. He stopped meditating after only managing to get the worst of his chaotic energy under control.\nRefilling his empty dantian would be better done after getting some rest.\nWhen he opened his eyes, he found several members of his group surrounding him protectively.\n\"Congratulations on your breakthrough, Young Master.\"\nAs Dam Bin spoke up as the representative, Il-mok frowned.\n\"Sorry, but my head is absolutely killing me. Could you keep it down a little?\"\n\"I'll be careful, Young Master.\"\nDam Bin bowed her head and stepped back, apologizing in a tiny voice.\n\"It's fine.\"\nHe tried to focus on the upsides to take his mind off the pounding in his skull.\nSo, he'd fought a bunch of psychos who used drugs and illusions to start a death cult, and he was now seriously injured and had a migraine from hell. But at least he'd gained something.\nIn fact, what he'd gained was even bigger than the immediate power-up.\n'I've found the direction I need to walk.'\nIl-mok's current state was less about having crossed a wall and more akin to having succeeded in arriving at the foot of a new mountain.\nWithout knowing which mountain to climb, all the hard work in the world is pointless.\nYou can end up going the wrong way, running in circles, or even sliding backwards.\nIn that sense, Il-mok had found the mountain he needed to climb.\nNot only that, he'd even caught a glimpse of what lay at the summit.\nAll that remained now was to head straight for that peak.\nWhen that time came...\n'Soon enough, I'll be saying goodbye to you too, you damn side effect.'\nHe could finally be free from this stupid compulsion.\nEntering the Realm of Truth and becoming an Absolute Master was just a secondary concern for Il-mok.\n—Hmph. You think it'll be that easy?\nIgnoring the sulky bastard's grumbling, Il-mok closed his eyes tightly then opened them to calm his headache a bit before asking, \"How long was I meditating?\"\n\"About an hour, Young Master. During that time, Hayeon and I stood guard while the others searched the area.\"\n\"Find anything?\"\nIn response, Dam Bin pulled a small book from her sleeve.\n\"We found this on Ghost Valley Master's corpse.\"\nOn the booklet were the crimson characters for [Blood Curse Record].\nAs Il-mok took the book, Dam Bin spoke up.\n\"My knowledge of shamanistic arts isn't deep enough to fully understand it, but everything within was about spells, Formations, or ritual implements that use human blood.\"\nHaving said that, Dam Bin pointed to the headless corpse of the Ghost Valley Master's body.\n\"The Dead Spirit Blood Demon Formation and the Ink Blood Steel Barrier he created are also described in that book.\"\n\"Hmm. This might be a journal he kept while researching sorceries.\"\n\"That seems unlikely.\"\nWhen Il-mok looked at Dam Bin with a questioning look, she elaborated.\n\"The book appears to be decades old. The paper is worn, the ink has bled in places, and some pages are torn. There are also signs of recent additions. In my opinion, Ghost Valley Master probably stumbled upon this book by chance and only then started using blood sorceries.\"\n\"Come to think of it, those Taoist scammers mentioned that the Ghost Valley Master suddenly started performing human sacrifices out of nowhere. And considering he kept the book hidden on his person, he probably kept it secret even from his disciples.\"\nThe party members nodded their heads at Il-mok's reasoning.\nDam Bin hesitated for a second, then spoke up carefully.\n\"This is just a guess, but there's one faction I suspect might be the source of that book.\"\n\"Which one?\"\n\"The Blood Cult.\"\nIl-mok tilted his head. The name didn't ring a bell.\nIt was a faction that appeared often in the martial arts novels he'd read in his modern life, but this was the first time he'd heard of it since being reincarnated here.\n\"Can you tell me more about this Blood Cult?\"\n\"They were a fanatical cult that caused a lot of trouble in the Central Plains about seventy years ago, before I was born, so I do not know the full details. I have merely heard it said that, true to their name, they used sorceries, Formations, and martial arts related to blood.\"\nHer explanation only confirmed Il-mok's suspicion that this book was their handiwork.\n\"What happened to this Blood Cult?\"\n\"Since they slaughtered countless innocent civilians, both the Murim Alliance and the Imperial Court stepped forward to subjugate them. I also heard that the last of their remnants even came to our Divine Cult to request aid.\"\nFrom her explanation, Il-mok could roughly imagine how that story ended.\n\"I assume our Divine Cult told them to get lost.\"\nJoining forces with people who used helpless civilians as sacrificial offerings would directly violate the doctrines of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.\n\"That's correct. The only reason I know anything is because I read the old records about them making contact and us turning them down. I apologize for not knowing more details beyond that.\"\n\"That's plenty of good information. I didn't even know the Blood Cult existed in the first place.\"\nIl-mok gave her a reassuring nod, then looked down at the book in his hands with a complicated face.\n'The Blood Cult was already wiped out long ago, huh...'\nMaybe this was some kind of Blood Cult legacy that the Ghost Valley Master had stumbled upon by chance.\nOr maybe, just maybe, some of them survived and are starting to crawl out of the woodwork again.\nHe thought about it for a second.\n'My head already hurts too much for this. To hell with it.'\nSoon enough, he shut off those thoughts.\n'Besides, I don't even need to hunt down every last one of them myself.'\nBut that didn't mean he'd turn a blind eye to those pieces of trash.\n‘I'll just tell Master about it or leak the information to some upstanding faction in the Central Plains. There's no shortage of people who'd jump at the chance to hunt those bastards down.'\nWith that problem mentally filed away, his eyes drifted from the book.\nHe looked over at his own sword, lying in two pieces where he'd dropped it.\n\"Tch. I need to get myself a new sword.\"\nAt Il-mok's mutter, Ouyang Mun stepped forward as if he'd been waiting for this moment.\n\"From what I've examined, this one's made of surprisingly good material, Young Master.\"\nAs expected, when it wasn't about Jin Hayeon, Ouyang Mun was excellent at handling matters.\nBut Il-mok just stared at the sword with a sour look on his face.\n\"Isn't that the Ghost Valley Master's sword?\"\n\"Hahaha! Who cares who owned it before? A famous sword should be in the hands of a master to show its true worth, don't you think?\"\nOuyang Mun's cheerful laugh made Il-mok's eye twitch.\n'The old owner isn't the issue, you idiot.'\nHow should he put it...\nIt was... well, maybe he was imagining it, but the sword was practically oozing a ghostly qi.\nHe couldn't even guess how many souls and how much blood a sword had to soak up to get like this.\nJust from its aura, it felt like the kind of sword that would cut down anything in its path, probably including whoever was holding it.\nIt was a textbook cursed sword. A genuine cursed artifact.\nAfter staring at that cursed thing for a moment, Il-mok sighed and replied.\n\"Keep it for now. It'll have some use or another.\"\nHe figured it could be used as evidence or sent to the main headquarters. There had to be some use for it.\n'If things go sideways, it seems like it would make a good gift for someone I want to kill.'\nInstead of giving an extra rice cake to someone he hated, gifting them a demonic sword might produce quite satisfying results.\nBesides that, the party was also packing away other artifacts used by the Ghost Valley Master and his disciples, and anything else that seemed useful.\nThe most interesting piece was the tablet that the Ghost Valley Master had used for his shield.\nThe Ink Blood Steel Barrier, the thing that created that blood energy barrier.\nBut it was covered in tiny cracks now, probably from where Il-mok's big attack had shattered the barrier.\n'Tsk. It was made using people as sacrifices anyway, so using it would feel wrong.'\nStill, you never know, so he told them to pack it up with the rest of the stuff.\nOnce they'd gathered up all the morbid loot, the team started following Jeong Hyeon.\nIt turned out that while Il-mok was meditating and the others were playing guard (scavenger), she'd been doing some actual scouting.\nOne of them was a field blooming with certain flowers.\nButterfly Dream Grass.\nMaybe it was the moonlight, or maybe it was just knowing what those flowers were used for, but the whole field had an eerie beauty to it.\nIl-mok let out a light sigh.\n\"I'd love to just torch the whole place, but we'd probably set the entire mountain on fire.\"\nHe thought about using his Dew Condensation Spell to control the blaze, but the field was massive and he was in no shape for that kind of exertion.\n\"Miss Jeong. Besides this place, were there any other locations we should see?\"\nAt Il-mok's question, Jeong Hyeon nodded with a somewhat bitter expression.\nCurious, the group followed Jeong Hyeon's guidance through the forest path, and before long, they arrived in front of a cave.\nAnd saw the bodies. A pile of them, tossed aside like garbage. They all had the same blank look as the fanatics from the town.\nThe sight of the carnage under the moonlight made Il-mok curse under his breath.\n\"Fucking monsters.\"\nThe others were just as furious.\n\"We let them off too easy.\"\n\"We'll make sure their corpses pay for their crimes.\"\nListening to his enraged companions while staring intently at the cave, Il-mok spoke up.\n\"First, let's head back to the main buildings. We'll get some rest, and then we'll give these people a proper burial before we leave.\"\nIl-mok felt they should at least let these people rest in peace. [! ] ]",

    "content": "Chapter 218: Son of a Bitch (1)\nAfter deciding to rest here for a day, the group left the Formation and headed toward the Kongtong Sect's main hall.\nThe place had been run by impostors, but they hadn't wrecked it.\nAfter cleaning up the corpses of the Taoist fiends whom Dam Bin had assassinated when they first entered, Il-mok picked the cleanest hall among them to get some sleep.\nHe wasn't about to sleep without taking a long bath and changing into fresh clothes, of course.\nThose scammers must have lived here when they weren't busy with their death rituals, as there were spare robes and plenty of water.\nHe was dead to the world, so deep in sleep he had no idea how much time had passed.\n\"Haaaaah.\"\nIl-mok woke with a lazy stretch and stepped out of the hall to find the sun already high in the sky.\nMaybe it was because he'd gotten some solid rest, but even the headache from breaking through the blood barrier had settled down quite a bit.\n\"You're awake, Young Master?\"\n\"A-are you feeling b-better now?\"\nOuyang Mun and Jeong Hyeon greeted Il-mok as he emerged.\n\"I feel pretty refreshed. Are you two doing alright?\"\n\"We took turns standing guard in three shifts of two, so we managed to get some rest.\"\n\"Th-the others are st-still sleeping right now.\"\nIl-mok nodded at their response and sat down cross-legged.\n\"Alright. We should probably start getting ready to move. I'm going to meditate until everyone else is up.\"\nHe spent the next thirty minutes or so finally circulating his qi, something he'd been too injured to do last night.\nAfter restoring his internal energy to some degree, he opened his eyes to find everyone else had woken up as well.\nThe group scrounged up a quick meal from whatever the fake Kongtong Sect had left behind.\n\"Young Master, while we were on watch, we searched the buildings and the bodies. We found a few more things.\"\nDam Bin presented Il-mok with items the group had collected. Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn novᴇlfire.net\nIt was mostly small trinkets and charms, but there were also a few books.\n\"Are these related to sorcery too?\"\nJin Hayeon answered Il-mok's question.\n\"I skimmed through them, but they're not like the Blood Curse Record. Some are about sorcery, but if I had to describe them, they're more like journals written by the Ghost Valley Master's disciples.\"\nFollowing her explanation, Il-mok pocketed the books first, then entered the Formation again with his companions.\nTheir first destination was the cave that had been packed full of corpses.\n\"We need to dig the ground so we can bury them properly.\"\nAt his word, the whole team started digging.\nSince they were all top-tier martial artists, they just channeled their energy into their hands, and graves appeared in seconds.\nWhile the group was busy digging dozens of graves...\nIl-mok, whose obsessive clean-freak tendencies were flaring up, decided to read one of the journals they'd found instead of getting his hands dirty.\n'There might be clues about the Blood Cult, so I should look through this first.'\nThe book he started reading was indeed a journal, just as Jin Hayeon had said.\nIt contained most of what the Taoist bastard who wrote this journal had done.\nLearning sorcery from the Ghost Valley Master, deceiving innocent people from Pingliang County and using them as sacrifices, managing the Butterfly Dream Grass growing in the fields, and so on.\nAs he quickly skimmed through the journal filled with various records...\n\"Hmm?\"\nIl-mok paused at one particular passage.\n'I wonder if this matters much?'\nAs Il-mok pondered how to digest this unexpected information...\nDam Bin's voice snapped him back to attention.\n\"Young Master, we've made about a hundred graves for now.\"\nIl-mok closed the book and said, \"Then we should start taking the corpses from the cave and burying them one by one.\"\nWith those words, Il-mok took a deep breath and started walking.\n'Let's just do what I can.'\nIl-mok wrapped his arms with a cloth he'd prepared in advance, then began removing corpses from the cave with his companions and placing them in the graves —\n—You crazy bastard! Don't you know about corpse poison!?\n—GTHE GERMS! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY GERMS ARE ON THAT THING!?\n— While fighting against the side effect screaming in one corner of his mind.\nEven though he was getting stronger and began to step away from Extremity, he still fell short of achieving Transcendent in the end.\nIt took every ounce of his willpower to ignore his screaming OCD and touch the dead bodies.\n'SHUT THE FUCK UP!!'\nStill, Il-mok yelled back in his mind and kept working.\nThis was about honoring the dead. He couldn't back down just because it was \"unclean.\"\nThe reason he had entrusted the digging of the graves to the party was so that he could move the bodies with his own hands.\nIf his hygiene compulsion had already flared up from digging in the dirt, he likely wouldn't have been able to touch them at all.\nHe'd only managed to move five bodies when Seon-ah saw the cold sweat on his brow and grabbed his arm.\n\"Big Brother, please rest and leave this work to us.\"\n\"These people died unjustly. I should help however I can to honor their spirits.\"\nHearing that, the others finally got what was going on and chimed in.\n\"Young Master, you already killed the monster responsible for this. That's the most important thing. They will understand that you can't help it due to your condition.\"\n\"That's right, Young Master. Our Divine Cult’s doctrine emphasises killing the evil doer who torments the common folk. You’ve done more than enough.”\nDam Bin and Jin Hayeon tried to stop Il-mok with their own logic.\n\"P-please r-rest...\"\nThen there was Jeong Hyeon, who tried to chime in but was too quiet to be heard.\n\"Hahaha. If you overexert yourself and fall into Qi Deviation and go on a rampage, Young Master, we won't be able to handle it.\"\n\"That's fine by me! If the Young Master goes berserk, I will gladly sacrifice myself to stop him!\"\n\"Oh! That method works too, Miss Ju! If that happens, Hayeon and I...\"\n\"Don't even start, Senior Ouyang.\"\nAnd then there were Ouyang Mun and Ju Seo-yeon, who took turns spouting nonsense.\nHe understood that, in their own weird ways, they were all just worried about him. Realizing this, Il-mok finally relented and watched them work with a small nod of thanks.\n'This won't completely ease your resentment, but I hope you can rest a little more peacefully.'\nTime passed as they kept working.\nAs they pulled more and more bodies from the cave, it became clear that a hundred graves weren't going to be nearly enough.\nIn the end, some dug additional graves while others continued extracting bodies until they finally managed to bury all the corpses piled in the cave.\nWhen they were done, there were one hundred and twenty-seven burial mounds.\nIl-mok and his companions pressed their palms together and prayed for the dead.\nAs they stood in silent tribute, an eerie quiet fell over the valley.\nIt was broken by a soft, gentle breeze that seemed to sweep through the graves, as if paying its own respects.\nAnd right after the breeze departed, caressing the burial mounds...\nFrom a far distance, a very faint noise could be heard.\nRecognizing it as human voices, the group opened their eyes and looked at each other.\n\"Could be more of the Ghost Valley Master’s disciples.\"\nWith cold expressions, they nodded and quickly exited the Formation.\nBut when they got there, the scene was not at all what they'd expected. The newcomers weren't those Taoist scammers but the townspeople.\n\"P-pleeeease~!!\"\n\"S-send us to paradise!\"\nTo be precise, they were the addicts.\nThey looked awful. Not just because the drug had ravaged their bodies, but also from the trip they'd made to get here.\nWhile Pingliang County is indeed the closest county to Mount Kongtong, the actual distance is still dozens of miles away.\nA martial artist could make the trip in three hours or so, but for the common folks, it would take at least half a day of walking to reach this distance.\nOn top of that, they'd had to climb Mount Kongtong's treacherous terrain, which meant these people had walked continuously for a day to get here.\nTheir clothes were covered in dust and dirt, and their faces and bodies showed small cuts and scrapes.\nThey'd walked this entire distance until they looked like this. Just to get a bit of that damn drug.\nThe team looked to Il-mok, and Il-mok sighed once and gave his orders.\n\"Knock them out. Hit their pressure points to paralyze them and keep them quiet. Then force-feed them some water and food. After that, put them to sleep.\"\nThere was no way he was going to give them the drug, no matter how much they begged.\nWhile the team was busy gently taking down the desperate townspeople, Il-mok laid out the next phase.\n\"Miss Ju and Young Warrior Ouyang will stay here. Handle any others that show up the same way. The rest of us are going back to burn that damn flower field to the ground.\"\nOuyang Mun and Ju Seo-yeon didn't look too happy about being left behind, but Il-mok didn't care.\nAs Il-mok turned his back and started on the path back toward the Formation—\n\"Hm?\"\n—He stopped and tilted his head at a strange sight.\nWhat he was looking at was the demonic sword Ouyang Mun had retrieved for him the day before. The demonic sword that he had left on the side because it felt distasteful to touch.\n'Did I sense it wrong yesterday because I wasn't feeling well? It seems like... the ghostly qi has decreased?'\nStill, a demonic sword was a demonic sword.\nIl-mok quickly lost interest and entered the Formation with his companions.\nThey first moved toward the nearby stream.\nAfter filling jars and gourds they'd brought from the Kongtong Sect's hall with water, they headed to the field.\nDam Bin used a fire-starter she took from her sleeve to set fire to one side of the field.\nThe wind caught the flames, and the fire started to spread.\nIl-mok watched it carefully. Whenever the fire tried to jump from the flowers to the surrounding forest, he would flash a hand sign.\nShaaaaaaa.\nWhile Il-mok extinguished fires using the Dew Condensation Spell, his companions also used jars and gourds to put out flames that spread to the wrong places.\nIn Jin Hayeon's case, she used the cold energy from her White Hand Demonic Art to suppress the fire.\nAnd while Il-mok and Jin Hayeon bought time, the companions repeatedly fetched more water and sprinkled it around.\nFire naturally goes out when it runs out of fuel. They simply prevented the flames from spreading outward while burning the field.\nAfter wrestling with fire for about two hours, the place where the fire had completely died out had transformed into a burned field covered only in ash.\nWith their job done, they left the Formation again and returned to the hall.\nIn the two hours they'd been gone, three more addicts had shown up at Mount Kongtong.\nIl-mok briefly observed those subdued by Ouyang Mun and Ju Seo-yeon.\n\"Looks like the situation in Pingliang County is much more serious than I had thought.\"\nSince it was already too late to return to Lanzhou immediately anyway, Il-mok decided to stop by Pingliang County to check on the situation while resting.\nAs everyone started packing up their gear, Il-mok glanced at the cursed sword one more time.\n\"Hm?\"\nThe ghostly qi had decreased quite a bit more. At this point, calling it a demonic sword felt like an overstatement.\n\"Why?\"\nPuzzled, Il-mok picked up the demonic sword and left the Kongtong Sect's hall with his companions.\nEach carrying civilians who'd been put to sleep with acupoint pressure.\nUsing their lightness skills, they managed to enter Pingliang County again.\n\"Haah...\"\nThey could see the village looking even more anxious and lethargic than when they'd visited before.\nSighing at the bitter scene, Il-mok felt something strange and looked down toward his hip.\nThe demonic sword he'd strapped to his side for travel was vibrating faintly, as if crying.\nNaturally, Il-mok thought about the changes in the demonic sword.\n'After we held the funeral for the bodies, the ghostly qi decreased. And it decreased again after we burned that field.'\nAs a result, Il-mok arrived at a certain hypothesis.\n\"...You want me to resolve their grudges, don't you?\"\nMany of those who'd become sacrifices to this sword must have been from this village. Which meant the people still living here were their families or friends.\nMaybe the spirits' last regret, the one thing tying them to this world, was worrying about the people they'd left behind.\nAs if to say, Yes, that's it! , the sword let out a powerful hum.\nWOOONG!\nIl-mok looked down at the sword and spoke to it soothingly.\n\"We can't do it with just us right now. We don't have enough manpower. So wait just a little longer.\"\nWith those words, Il-mok turned his head to look somewhere.\nIt was the direction where Lanzhou lay.\nAfter resting in Pingliang County, Il-mok and his companions ran continuously from early dawn for half a day before arriving at the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's Lanzhou branch around afternoon.\nThe Lanzhou Branch Leader greeted Il-mok with respect as he returned four days after leaving.\n\"Young Master! A special dog from the Beggars’ Gang has come!\"\nUnfortunately, he also came with some unexpected news. [! ] ]",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 219 : Son of a Bitch (2)",
    "content": "Chapter 219: Son of a Bitch (2)\nHu gae a title reserved for the Beggars’ Gang's Seven-Knot Beggar and the disciple of the Chief himself.\nWhen news arrived that this beggar had come calling, Il-mok frowned and asked, \"Is he at the branch office right now?\"\n\"No, Young Master. He's been lurking around the Maitreya Luminous Cult's estate since yesterday.\"\nThe Branch Leader's explanation made Il-mok let out a light sigh. \"Well then, guess I have to go meet him.\"\nSeeing Il-mok's reluctant response, Jin Hayeon who was standing nearby asked, \"Is it really necessary to meet with the beggar, Young Master?\"\n\"We'll make sure there's no evidence left behind, Big Brother,\" Seon-ah added with a smile. It was a smile that promised a bloody death.\n\" Ahem . I appreciate the thought, but there's no need for that.\"\nHe wasn't saying no because he thought they'd fail. To be honest, if she coordinated with Dam Bin and the personnel at the Hidden Guard Pavilion, they could probably pull it off somehow.\nThe real issue was that killing him would be a waste. In fact, if they played their cards right, keeping him alive would be far more beneficial.\n\"We can use this opportunity to tell him about what happened at Mount Kongtong. That way, the one who’ll work is the Beggars’ Gang, not us.”\n\"You mean, investigate the Blood Cult?\" Seon-ah asked.\nJin Hayeon answered in his stead. \"The Beggars’ Gang is famous throughout the Central Plains as an information network. When it comes to gathering intel in the Central Plains, they'd definitely be faster than our Divine Cult.\"\nAs Il-mok nodded in agreement, Dam Bin spoke up. \"What those lunatics on the mountain did was unforgivable, and I agree we should hunt down anyone involved. But we have no actual proof this was the Blood Cult’s doing, Young Master.\"\nAt her words, Il-mok shrugged his shoulders and replied casually, \"Doesn't matter if they were connected or not. The point is to get the Beggars' Gang to think they were, and go chasing them.\"\nFor a moment, everyone looked confused. Wasn't that the same thing? But Dam Bin, with her wealth of experience, was the first to catch onto Il-mok's real intention.\n\"Your primary objective is to redirect the beggars' attention away from us and toward the Blood Cult.\"\nOnly then did the others grasp Il-mok's true plan, and they looked at him with various expressions.\n\"Even though we're operating under fake names, the last thing we need is the Beggars' Gang breathing down our necks.\"\nBut internally, he was thinking something else entirely.\nAnd there's the problem of the cleanup.'\nHis mind went back to Pingliang County, and he glanced down at the sword hanging at his hip.\nThey were already short on manpower. If he could get the Beggars' Gang involved, he could trick them into providing the manpower he needed to fix the town.\nWhile Il-mok was lost in thoughts about Pingliang County, Seon-ah noticed something odd and asked, \"But Big Brother, if that's the case, why were you so reluctant to meet the beggar?\"\nAt the young girl's question, Il-mok's body trembled as he answered, \"Because he's a beggar. The thought of having to stand near a beggar... It's making my skin crawl.\"\nIl-mok still hadn't freed himself from his hygiene obsession.\n\"So for now, could you bring me some water to wash with, Branch Leader? I feel disgusting after traveling all day.\"\nLanzhou’s market.\nAs always, Byeok was humming hymns with his father as they continued their business.\nSuddenly, he snapped his fingers with an \"Ah!\" as if remembering something and shouted at his father, “Dad, it’s time for class! I'll head to the Maitreya Luminous Cult's estate now!\"\nTo anyone watching, he looked like the most dedicated student in the world. But in reality, he'd been dying to get out of work all day.\nHis father, of course, wasn't fooled for a second.\n\"You little brat! If you're just going to run off and chase skirts again, you can stay here and man the shop. I'll go to class in your place!\"\nCaught red-handed, Byeok laughed awkwardly. \"Ahaha. Th-that's not it, Dad! I'm going to learn how to read, I swear!\"\nHis father sighed at the terrible acting.\n'Tch. He's grown on the outside, but he's still just a kid inside!'\nParents always see their kids as children, but this was something else.\nStill, this was a chance for his son to finally become literate, and he wasn't going to stand in the way of that.\nWhen Byeok was a boy, his father had been too broke to afford a real education for him.\nBoth father and son had only learned a handful of numbers needed for business and a few basic characters.\n\"When you come home tonight, you have to teach me the characters you learned today! If you come back without remembering them, next time I'll be the one going to lessons instead, you hear?\"\nAt his father's stern warning, Byeok's face brightened immediately. \"You bet, Dad!\"\nFinding his son's attitude suspicious, the father quickly grabbed a cloth and wrapped up a few pieces of their best fruit.\nSince he couldn't trust his son, he decided to send a small gift to the teachers to ask them to keep a good eye on his hopeless son.\n\"Take these with you! This is for the teachers. If I hear you gave them to girls instead while chasing after them, you'll be in serious trouble. You hear me?\n\"Yes, Dad!\"\nKnowing he'd only get more nagging if he stayed, Byeok quickly grabbed the bundle and left the fruit shop.\nSimilar scenes were playing out all across Lanzhou.\nAt a brothel tucked away in the red-light district, several courtesans who had only fallen asleep at dawn were now waking up and preparing to head out.\n\"Haaaaah.\"\nAwakened by the sound of their movements, another courtesan looked at them with tired eyes as they hurried about. \"You're all so diligent. How is learning a few letters going to change our lives?\"\n\"Haven't you heard the story? Some of the girls who learned to read ended up working at the clinic there. Why can't that be us?\"\n\"So what, you want to become a female physician?\"\n\"Why not~?\"\nThe young courtesan replied with a humming voice and left the red-light district with eyes that shone too bright for someone working in a brothel.\nPeople from all over Lanzhou were gathering at an estate with a plaque that read [Maitreya Luminous Cult].\nSome were happy simply to learn how to read after living their entire lives illiterate. Others imagined a future that would change through literacy.\nAnd some were just there to meet cute girls.\nBut no matter why they came, the place was buzzing with life.\nAnd it wasn't just those heading to the hall with the [School] sign.\n\"Oh, Physician!\"\nThose gathered at the building marked [Clinic] might have been expected to have a gloomy atmosphere, since they were all ill, but their eyes held hope, all thanks to the physician who offered free treatment.\nAnd it wasn't just the patients.\n\"I don't have time to teach this twice, so watch carefully.\"\nAs Physician Seo Jae-pil treated patients, the women beside him did their best to record every detail of his treatment process with brushes and papers they'd brought.\nThey were all former courtesans from the red-light district who had quit to become medical assistants.\nBut in one quiet corner of this bustling estate, two beggars lay sprawled out.\nOne of them had three knots tied to their sash, while the other had seven,\nThe Three-Knot Beggar was the same one who had traveled from Lanzhou to the Beggars’ Gang headquarters, and the Seven-Knot Beggar was none other than the disciple of the Chief, Little Tiger Beggar.\n\"Wow. I couldn't enter Beijing since I'm a beggar, so I've never been there, but I've never seen such a hopeful place anywhere in the world.\"\n\"Tell me about it, sir. While I was traveling to headquarters and back, I never thought they'd built all of this in the short time I was gone.\"\n\"You're telling me. They've even got construction going on in the back area.\"\n\"Most of the workers there used to be beggars we looked after.\"\n\"That's what I'm saying. And I heard that school even teaches beggars with physical disabilities.\"\nFor a man who had seen almost everything, this place was something else entirely.\nHe continued observing the Maitreya Luminous Cult's estate with an intrigued expression for a while longer.\nJust then, the crowd bustling around the estate parted to both sides, and a man wearing a wrathful deity mask appeared.\nAnd that masked man is heading straight for the Little Tiger Beggar. Thɪs chapter is updated by NoveIＦire.net\n'According to what the Branch Leader Hong Gae said, he should be a shaman or something...?'\nBut the vibe he was getting was weird.\nAs the future leader of the Beggars' Gang, the Little Tiger Beggar was a top-tier master himself. He could tell the masked man was dangerous. Seriously dangerous.\nThe problem was that's all he could tell. He couldn't pin down exactly what level they were at, whether they were really a shaman, sorcerer, or if they'd learned martial arts. Nothing. It was like trying to see through fog.\n'The Heavenly Orchid Society Leader who originally controlled this area was said to be at the Supreme Peak Realm, so this is probably the one who killed him.'\nWhile the Little Tiger Beggar roughly assessed his opponent, the man stopped about ten feet away.\n\"It seems you have come with some business for our Maitreya Luminous Cult. Follow me.\"\nThe masked man turned around and headed toward an empty hall.\n\"Oho.\"\nHis interest piqued, Little Tiger Beggar scratched his beard and stood up.\n\"You wait here.\"\nLeaving the Three-Knot Beggar behind, Little Tiger Beggar followed the masked man into the hall and sat across from him.\n\"Not planning to take off that mask?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Hmm. Everyone who hides their face has something shady to hide.\"\n\"Hiding among beggars isn't any different, is it?\"\n\"Hahaha. That's an interesting point. But we do it to protect the beggars.\"\n\"And we do it to protect the common folks. If no one knows who the Incarnation of Maitreya is among the common folks, the evil men will think twice before hurting them, won't they?\n\"Hmm.\"\nSensing he couldn't shake his opponent with this topic, Little Tiger Beggar changed the subject.\n\"I've been watching you folks for the past few days, and I’d say your concern for the common folks is truly admirable. But in this world, nobody gives away that much money for nothing.\"\n\"Is that how the Beggars' Gang works? You only help beggars because you want something? Ah, that's right. You run the world's biggest spy network. I'm sure that's just a coincidence.\"\n\"Are you mocking our Beggars’ Gang right now?\"\nLittle Tiger Beggar's face twisted as he asked, but the masked man just shrugged with indifferent eyes.\n\"I meant we're two of a kind. Just as the Beggars’ Gang helps beggars, we simply wish to help the common people.\"\nHe'd deliberately tried to gauge his opponent's reaction, but Little Tiger Beggar gained nothing from it.\nThe eyes behind the mask didn't even flicker.\n'This guy's an old fox who's weathered every storm in life.'\nTo put it nicely, they had shrewd eyes. To put it harshly, they were the dead fish eyes of someone already jaded by life.\nRealizing these mind games were getting him nowhere, Little Tiger Beggar decided to get straight to the point. \"Good. Glad we're on the same side. But our Beggars’ Gang is so poor we have to sell secrets just to feed our people. Where on earth are you getting the cash for all this?\"\n\"We took it from the criminals we killed. The old gangs that used to run this city and others.\"\n\"And what happens when that money's gone? Don't tell me you plan to rob innocent people?\"\n\"When the money's gone, we stop. Why would we rob people?\"\nWhen his opponent asked back as if confused, Little Tiger Beggar pressed him, \"Wait, so you're saying once that money's gone, you won't help people anymore?\"\n\"Obviously.\"\nLittle Tiger Beggar was about to argue, but the masked man's words came faster.\n\"Why do you think we're teaching them to read? Why do you think we're training them to be doctors and carpenters? Ever hear the saying, ‘Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach him how to fish and you feed him for a lifetime’?”\nIt was an old saying meaning to teach people the method rather than just giving them charity.\nOnly then did Little Tiger Beggar grasp what the man was really saying, and the scenes he'd witnessed in Lanzhou over the past two days came flooding back.\n'No way ... I didn't think they'd considered it that far.'\nHe suddenly felt a little embarrassed.
