    "content": "<Prologue. This Trade is a Draw>\n\"Now, let’s clear things up.\"\nThe woman put down the tobacco pipe she had been gently biting down on, puffed out the smoke, and licked her lips. She was a beautiful woman with striking red, wavy hair, but more importantly was the fact that she was a ’god’.\n\"So, what you desire is... an immortal body and infinite growth potential?\"\n\"Yes!\"\n\"Nope, not possible. Go back.\"\n\"Aw, don’t be like that.\"\nThe man, a 27-year-old man called Lee Shin Woo, sat opposite from the woman, separated by an antique desk. He was an ordinary office worker who liked fantasy novels and games. Well, at least until he died.\nAnd now that he’d died, he was a hero that had been chosen by a god. Probably.\n\"I heard that I still had a long life ahead of me, yet I died prematurely. Shouldn’t I receive at least this much from a god since I died so unfairly?\"\n\"Jeez, the novels these days have really spoilt these kids’ backbone. Before, if I told them they were getting a second chance, they would go ’yippee’ or yell ’call’.\"\n\"Well, people change as the times go by.\"\nThough God wanted to hit Lee Shin Woo, who had nonchalantly nodded his head and replied to her, she restrained herself. After all, it was none other than her who had gathered the souls of those who had died unfairly, because she needed their help.\n’If he was from my world, then I would’ve just...’\nShe was certainly a god, but she wasn’t the god of Earth. She was the god who reigned over Heguroa, which differed in culture, history, size, and every other aspect from Earth.\nThen why was she in a situation where she had to bring souls from another world? There was a truly sad, tear-jerking reason behind that.\n\"Anyhow, those guys sure are cold-hearted. Their god is saying that she’ll get herself involved and clean up their mess, but they’re just avoiding it since they don’t want to die.\"\n\"There were a lot of heroes who accepted my revelation, you know!? ...They all just died in Heita.\"\nLee Shin Woo instinctively gulped and asked God.\n\"... Is the place that dangerous?\"\n\"Of course, it is.\"\nGod couldn’t hide her bitterness, and responded for a second time, putting the tobacco pipe back into her mouth. If she didn’t at least do that, she felt like she would’ve sighed in front of a human.\nThis was a story that happened several decades ago. Heita, a great empire that thrived in the undergrounds of Heguroa, was met with tragedy. Their emperor, Jissehanu, dreamt of immortality and researched forbidden black magic, but as a consequence of his recklessness... the entire underground empire received an undead curse.\nWhat’s worse, the curse would spread gradually, and if left unchecked, would devour the entire world.\nGod, recognizing the severity of the situation, passed down a divine revelation to all humans and promised that she would grant a wish to the savior of the Empire.\nThere were many heroic men who came forward. But all of them failed. The curse deeply rooted in the Empire was strong, and the heroes who headed underground in order to save the Empire couldn’t overcome the curse, degenerating into the undead, and becoming a part of the undead empire.\nOnly after did God decide to exhibit her power more extensively. She scattered and planted her power across the Empire, encouraging the heroes, but it didn’t help. The influence of the Empire, which sought to lead all life to undeath, gradually increased, and devoured half of the continent...\nAnd that’s when God, unable to endure any further, decided that she had to stop the Empire, even if it meant dragging heroes from other worlds. Lee Shin Woo was also one of them.\n\"Still, an immortal body is impossible. Ask for something else.\"\n\"Then please give me something similar.\"\n\"Listen, kid.\"\nGod raised her tobacco pipe and pointed at Lee Shin Woo’s shabby soul as she explained.\n\"Tremendous power burdens the owner. An immortal body? Infinite growth potential? You won’t be able to handle such power, and you’ll just explode and die. So, go on and offer more realistic, and fitting conditions.\"\n\"But with a realistic and fitting power, I’ll probably end up like my seniors, dying without being able to do anything.\"\n\"...\"\nAt that moment, the human’s words thrust deep into the god’s heart. Right now, Lee Shin Woo was practically declaring to the god that her ’struggles were meaningless’. Why should I hear this from a mere hero candidate? Should I just kill him? God momentarily felt the impulse to do just that, but... changed her mind upon seeing the human’s challenging expression.\nThis kid would have to go through hell before he could even understand her a little.\n\"Alright, I’ll do as you ask.\"\n\"Yeah!\"\n\"Of course, a perfect immortal body is impossible. You won’t die ordinarily, but you’ll still die in deadly situations.\"\n\"What about the infinite growth potential?\"\n\"That’s also up to you, but I’ll make it so it’s theoretically possible.\"\n\"Oh!\"\n\"In exchange.\"\nGod flicked her tobacco pipe, and ash flew through the air.\n\"You’ll lose something very important. Your normal, physical body can’t accept that power.\"\n\"What exactly is that important thing? I’m not going to become impotent, or become bald, am I?\"\n\"This is the best I can do. Now... Lee Shin Woo. Are you going to do it, or not?\"\nShe didn’t answer his question. He faced God’s spiteful, cold eyes, and he briefly felt conflicted, but.... he ultimately nodded his head and spoke. Even if he were to become impotent, or become bald, there’s a time when a man needs to take the risk!\n\"Alright, I’ll do it!\"\n\"Fine, then our contract has been established.\"\nGod put the pipe into her mouth again, and simultaneously, Lee Shin Woo’s body was enveloped in a bright light. Transmission magic that would transport his soul to the Heita Empire had been activated.\n\"You’ll be sent to the entrance of the Empire. Once you arrive there, I won’t be able to help you directly, but I’ll send you quests instead. You know what quests are, right?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Good, and when you arrive, remember to check your status first. It’s really important that you know who ’you’ are.\"\n\"Ok...?\"\nIt seemed as though God had grinned and laughed wickedly when she put the tobacco pipe into her mouth, but... he was soon shrouded by a bright light and was unable to see anything.\nIn the next moment, the light disappeared, and Lee Shin Woo’s body was dumped onto the cold floor. The transfer was done in the blink of an eye.\n\"Oof! She could have let me down a little more gently... hoo.\"\nLee Shin Woo grumbled softly and stood up. He had been dumped into an enormous underground cave, as expected of an underground empire.\nThere was a passageway on both of his sides, and it felt eerie as if mummies would pop out at any minute from all sides. At least there weren’t any enemies nearby.\n\"I was ready for this, but... this feels really serious... it’s cold, too.\"\nHe felt cold, perhaps because he didn’t have any clothes on. He stroked his skin in order to soothe the cold, but he soon realized that something was off.\n\"Huh?\"\nHis body was hard. The hand that had touched his body was also really hard. When he raised his hand to see what was going on, there were bones, rather than a human hand.\n\"...Huh?\"\nShin Woo was so shocked that he went stiff for a while. He somehow got a hold of himself, and when he moved his hand, the bones naturally bobbed. The five fingers composed of bone truly began to dance rhythmically in the air.\n\"Hahaha... no way. Haha, this guy.\"\nIt was such an unrealistic sight that he laughed automatically. For the first time, Lee Shin Woo bowed his head and observed his body, but his entire body was obviously all bone.\n\"...\"\nThe moment he saw that his mind blanked.\nWhat do I do? Is this by any chance God’s mistake? Did I perhaps receive the Empire’s curse as soon as I arrived, and became an undead? Then, he remembered what God had said before their sudden parting.\n\"That’s it. Status... She told me to check my status as soon as I arrived.\"\nThe moment Shin Woo said the word status, as though he had just grabbed onto a final strand of hope, a strange row of text was engraved in the air in front of him. It was similar to what he had often seen in the games when he was alive. Yeah, even the contents written within...\n[Lee Shin Woo]\n[Normal Skeleton Blessed by God]\n[Lv - 1]\n[Strength - 13, Agility - 13, Health - 13, Magic - 3]\n[Passive skills - Invisible Heart Lv1] Newest update provıded by N0v3l.Fiɾe.net\n[Active skills - Bone Reinforcement Lv1]\n\"...\"\nThe wind passed by his smooth (bald) skull, and his empty (impotent) crotch.\nIt only took around... 10 minutes before Lee Shin Woo figured out that this was neither God’s mistake, nor the Empire’s curse.",

    "content": "<Chapter 1. Reinforcement Hero - 1>\nAfter he had accepted that he would have to deal with a skeleton body (bald and impotent) from now on (even he thought it was an incredible feat of composure), Lee Shin Woo began to earnestly research his status.\nIf you know the enemy and you know yourself, you need not fear the results of a hundred battles. It was a basic principle to know oneself before entering the battlefield. Though he still lacked the courage to actually seek out his enemies.\n[Lee Shin Woo]\n[Normal Skeleton Blessed by God]\n[Lv - 1]\n[Strength - 13 Agility - 13 Health - 13 Magic - 3]\n[Passive skills - Invisible Heart Lv1]\n[Active skills - Bone Reinforcement Lv1]\n’I get that I’m a skeleton, but what does this blessing thing mean?’\nAs expected, he was most concerned about his class. No matter how he thought about it, this wasn’t a blessing, it was a curse. What exactly is the blessing? When he carefully thought about it, a series of text appeared, just like when he had called out the status window.\n[You are a skeleton that was blessed and created by God. As such, you will not take any damage from holy magic, and will instead receive 1.5x the normal recovery rate.]\n[You are unaffected by curses, as you were blessed by God. Your body is immune to all curses.]\n\"That’s unexpectedly amazing!\"\nThe ability was truly befitting of the word blessed! It felt like it wouldn’t be out of place to replace the term ’skeleton’ with the term ’angel’ instead. But she should’ve just made him an angel in the first place then... He thought pointlessly, and went over the next item.\n’In some ways, starting at level one is natural. And as for my physical abilities or my magic... I don’t know the standard here, so it doesn’t matter.’\nHe skipped past the level and stats and checked his skills, which were a reflection of his negotiations with God. He had one passive skill and one active skill, and Lee Shin Woo checked the passive skill first.\n[Invisible Heart Lv1 (Passive)]\n[Your heart cannot be seen, nor can it be grabbed. You are immune to mental status ailments, and you will revive even if your body is broken to pieces. Each revival will increase the skill level by 1. Each skill level will increase your stats by 3. However, you will be completely destroyed if the skill reaches the max level (Lv100).]\nOne of the secrets had been solved. He wondered why he was so composed despite being dumped into a situation like this, and it was all thanks to this skill! However, since it would help him survive in his current situation and wouldn’t be detrimental, he accepted the truth quite easily.\n’So, a perfect immortal body is impossible? But with this...’\nDid this mean he had 99 lives? Well, it didn’t seem like he would die under ordinary circumstances. Moreover, whenever he died, he would gain additional stat bonuses. Isn’t this an ability that forces him to accept that he’d become a skeleton?\nOf course, he didn’t know what would happen if his body was broken into several pieces all at once, or if it were possible to die several times at once. He had other questions like those, but since they were questions he couldn’t solve right away, he decided that he’d solve those problems later. Rather, it was actually better for it to remain unsolved forever.\n[Bone Reinforcement Lv1 (Active)]\n[Sacrifice a bone, or a piece of bone equipment in order to reinforce your bones or your bone equipment. You can absorb the special experiences and memories within the bone. The higher the level, the more effective the absorption.]\nThe last one was the skill that would ’theoretically’ allow Lee Shin Woo to grow indefinitely. But why didn’t he feel inspired when he saw it?\n’There’s no way to find out until I get a bone and try it out myself...’\nWhile thinking that, a series of text suddenly appeared before his eyes.\n[A quest has been generated!]\n\"Ah, a quest.\"\nThis was honestly a nice time for a quest since he didn’t know where to go. Perhaps the quest had waited for this moment. The contents of the quest were very suitable for him as well.\n[The Entrance of the Underground Empire]\n[The place where you have arrived at is the Underground Empire’s exterior passageway, where the effects of the curse are almost non-existent. However, the Empire’s guards are always patrolling these areas. Whether you exterminate or evade the patrols is up to you, but proceed forward, and find the hideout that possesses God’s power.]\n[Quest Reward: Minimap.]\n\"A minimap, huh...\"\nHe was curious as to what a minimap was like, and the passageway was a one-way road anyway. It wouldn’t be bad to find the hideout, and he also didn’t really have a reason to ignore the quest either.\nHe was still hostile to the God who made him like this, but since he didn’t want to lose out by going astray, Lee Shin Woo decided to follow the contents of the quest for now.\nBut just as he was about to move his body to do so, an undead appeared from far inside the passageway.\n[Patrol...ling... Are there no... heroes anywhere...]\nLuckily, it was a skeleton that looked similar to Lee Shin Woo; however, unlike him, it carried a decent white bone spear, and since it was in an equipped state, it was much better off than him.\nIt was surprising that a skeleton composed of all bones could speak and that he could understand what it was saying, but now wasn’t the time to be surprised about that.\n[Skeleton Soldier - Lv1]\nWhen he saw its appearance, its class and level appeared right before Lee Shin Woo’s eyes. But wait a second. It’s only level 1 when it looks like it should at least be level 5?\n\"How the hell is that level 1?\"\n[Hm... Voice... unclear...]\nHe had ended up talking aloud due to his shock that the skeleton was only level 1. The skeleton, which was several meters away, instantly turned its head towards him. It noticed him, even though it didn’t even have eyes.\n[Skeleton... I haven’t seen before... A newbie?]\n\"...\"\nIn that extremely short moment, Lee Shin Woo thought of countless things.\nThe other side is level 1, and I’m level 1 with high stats, so shouldn’t I just fight it, he thought. On the other hand, the other side has a weapon. Wouldn’t it be difficult for me, who doesn’t know any martial arts, to beat it bare-handed? He soon came to a conclusion.\n\"Yeah, I’m a newbie! Nice to meet you!\"\n[A newbie, huh... Nice to... meet you...]\nIf the enemy misunderstood and considered him an ally, then there was no need to throw away that advantage! Lee Shin Woo greeted him as brightly, and as pleasantly as he could, and slowly approached it. The Skeleton Soldier also approached him, as if there were no enemies around.\n[Your bones... are really clean...]\n\"Your bones are also... uh... sturdy.\"\n[Thanks...]\nThe skeleton soldier seemed happy from the compliment, and with the hand that wasn’t holding the spear, rubbed its head, while emitting a squeaky sound. When he saw that, Lee Shin Woo’s (nonexistent) eyes gleamed. This was his best chance!\nHe quickly extended both of his bone arms and stole its spear. The skeleton panicked as its weapon was snatched in the blink of an eye.\n[What... are you doing...!]\n\"It means I’m a newbie hero!\"\nSince he had never learned how to use a spear when he was alive, Lee Shin Woo just swung the spear like a club and attacked the skeleton. The moment it hit its bones, his own bones felt a considerable rebound force and he did his best to not let go of the spear.\n[You... traitor! You’re... with the goddess!]\n\"Who the hell is with that old hag!\"\nHe would pay her back later for turning him into this. It just wasn’t possible right now!\nLee Shin Woo swung the spear, focusing all his rage towards God into it while clenching his teeth. However, the skeleton would scream whenever it was hit by the bone spear, and it surprisingly didn’t back away, instead gradually getting closer.\n\"Isn’t this too hard for someone who’s level 1?\"\n[You traitor!]\nLee Shin Woo was shocked that the skeleton had so quickly gotten in front of him, and swung the spear with all his might, attacking it. However, the skeleton easily evaded the obvious attack, threw its body at him, and bashed into him!\n\"Ugh!\"\nOnce Lee Shin Woo was struck by his opponent’s decisive blow, he pitifully dropped the spear, and it fell to the floor. Even though he was just bones, no, perhaps because he was just bones, it hurt even more.\nTo make matters worse, when he had somehow managed to stand up, he saw that the Skeleton Soldier had regained its spear and was pointing it at him. Though the skeleton was cracked in various places due to his attacks, its spirit was no less than that of a Death Knight.\n[Executing... traitor...!]\n\"W-Wait a second, Paul! Remember our good old days...!\"\n[Executing!]\nThe Skeleton Soldier’s spear flew towards his skull, crushing it apart. It was a clean attack, compared to Lee Shin Woo’s unsightly attack. It was truly a perfect critical hit.\n[Execution complete. Returning to.... patrol...]\nThe Skeleton Soldier confirmed that Lee Shin Woo’s skull had indeed been crushed, and it seemed as though it were sure of his death, as it nodded its head and turned around. However, in the next instant, the broken pieces of Lee Shin Woo’s shattered skull emitted a faint light, gathered into one piece, and was restored.\n[Invisible Heart has become level 2. All stats have risen by 3.]\n[98 levels remaining until the max level.]\nLee Shin Woo regained consciousness in a split second and stood up without a sound. His empty eye sockets momentarily flickered with a faint flame before disappearing.\nHe carefully closed and opened his fist, and then attacked the defenseless and slowly moving skeleton from behind.\n[You’re...!?]\n\"Urgh...!\"\nIf he learned anything from his defeat, it was that a skeleton’s greatest weakness was their head. Lee Shin Woo didn’t even attempt to snatch away the spear this time. He rushed in real close, turned his hands into fists, and pounded on its skull like a madman.\n\"Die! Die!\"\n[Keuaaahk!?]\nThe Skeleton Soldier screamed and swung its spear, but they were too close for his spear to be effective. Its spear floundered in the air a few more times, and it soon threw it away, responding with its own fists, but by then, it was already too late.\nShin Woo didn’t know how many times he had struck its head, but the cracks he’d made thus far suddenly emitted a cracking sound and expanded, shattering the skull.\n[You have hunted a Lv1 Skeleton Soldier.]\nEven after the message appeared before his eyes, Lee Shin Woo remained on guard, but when he saw that the Skeleton Soldier was unable to maintain its body any longer, and start to break down, he barely released the tension within his body and dropped to the floor.\nThough an undead body didn’t feel fatigue, his mind that barely remained inside was completely groggy.\n\"I shouldn’t have underestimated him.’\nHe was confident that he had done everything he could to prepare. But there had been an unbridgeable gap in skill between him and the Skeleton Soldier.\nIts spear had crushed his skull in a single strike, and he had to strike him several times before he could do the same. That difference caused him to die once.\n’... I can’t help that I’ve already died once. I just have to not die again.’\nLee Shin Woo energized his spirit, which had been exhausted by the fierce battle. A mere Skeleton Soldier was nothing more than the lowest rank monster in the Empire. If he gave up here, he would be nothing. Follow current novᴇls on noveⅼfire.net\n\"Hoo.\"\nHe somehow exerted strength into his bones and stood up. Then, he saw 3 spoils of war that remained where the skeleton had disappeared.\nOne of the remaining items was the white bone spear he had used, another was a black coin, and the last one was a bone that had remained without breaking down. Lee Shin Woo instinctively extended his hand and grabbed them.\n[You have acquired a Lv1 Bone Spear.]\n[You have acquired the Skeleton Soldier’s Arm Bone.]\n[You have acquired 10 Perium.]\nWould there really be any need for money in an empire only comprised of the undead, he thought. That was the first question that had come to mind, but then again, he had a leather pouch on him, even though he was just bones.\nLee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and decided to put the coin into his pouch. Now, the only remaining things of importance were the two spoils of war.\n[Bone Spear]\n[Lv1]\n[Durability: 93/100]\n[Attack Power: 5 - 15]\nThe bone spear remained sturdy, despite clashing against bone several times during the battle. It had an important detail: there was a level on the item. No, there was more.\n[Would you like to sacrifice the bone spear in order to reinforce your bones? You can choose one of the following to reinforce: toe bone, leg bone, arm bone, a finger bone, upper jaw bone, and the lower jaw bone.]\n\"No.\"\nIt seemed as though it was possible for bone equipment to be sacrificed in order to reinforce the body, but he desperately needed a weapon right now, so he let it be. More importantly, there was still something left that could reinforce his bones.\n[Would you like to sacrifice the Skeleton Soldier’s Arm Bone to reinforce your bones? You can reinforce your arm bone.]\nLee Shin Woo scanned his surroundings before he nodded his head. The desolate passageway was silent, without even the sound of ants crawling by.\nWell, he had already killed a patrolling guard, so it would take some time before another one came up to bat. After he confirmed his safety, he silently muttered.\n\"Reinforce.\"",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 1 part2",
    "content": "<Chapter 1. Reinforcement Hero - 2>\nThe moment he used his Bone Reinforcement skill, the skeleton’s arm bone flickered with a weak flame and oxidized in the air, followed by a stinging feeling in his left arm.\n[You have reinforced your arm bone. Strength has increased by 1. Absorbing a portion of the Skeleton Soldier’s memories and experiences.]\n[That spear isn’t meant to be swung like that. Look. Though it may look like this, this is the spear technique that was taught to me by the strongest general of the Empire, General Leofield.]\nAnd that was it.\n\"...\"\nUm, alright. He didn’t have high expectations from the get-go. On the contrary, he should be happy that his strength permanently increased by 1. He didn’t know how long it would continue to increase his stats by 1 whole point, but if he put in the effort, step by step, he should be able to at least confront a Skeleton Soldier and win easily.\nLee Shin Woo did his very best to appease his disappointment, grabbed the spear on one side, and stood up. However, at that very moment, he felt as if something had changed.\n\"Mm...?\"\nDid the spear change? No, that wasn’t it. He himself had changed. Like he had done thus far, he grabbed the spear without thinking, and at that very moment, he was suddenly overcome with the thought that this wasn’t the proper way of wielding a spear.\nIf he wielded it like this, the spear would only be as effective as a club. In order to use a spear like a spear, he would need to hold it properly. He followed his instincts and changed his grip on the spear. Somewhere in that posture lay a similarity to the Skeleton Soldier’s own.\n[Passive Skill, Beginner Spearmanship Lv1 has been learned.]\n\"...!\"\nAt that moment, Lee Shin Woo’s (nonexistent) eyes widened. He had learned spearmanship from just absorbing the Skeleton Soldier’s memories of handling a spear!\nIf that’s the case, if he were to obtain another’s bones who learned a different skill, wouldn’t that mean that he’d be able to learn that skill as well? His evaluation of the Bone Reinforcement skill drastically changed for the better.\n’Good, I can accept this...’\nIf he had a normal human body, he wouldn’t even be able to dream of reinforcing his body through bones. The resurrection through his Invisible Heart was, of course, the same. These two skills were so powerful that he had no choice but to accept that he was a skeleton.\nIf he had, at first, been like ’even so, how could you turn me into a skeleton, you necromancer bitch!’, then now he was like ’now that it’s become like this, I’ll become the strongest skeleton!’. Lee Shin Woo swung the spear a few times and nodded his head in satisfaction.\n’My spearmanship’s still lousy, but I can at least stab decently now.’\nHe hadn’t learned any martial arts before, but he could tell whether his motions were proper, or a mess.\nSince he had swung the spear in the desperate battle to his heart’s content, he felt that the force behind his swing was incomparable to before.\n[Over there... Newbie...?]\n\"Yeah, newbie here! Good morning!\"\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t confident that he’d be able to overpower a Skeleton Soldier in a frontal assault, so he acted like a merry skeleton when a new patrolling guard appeared, and slowly walked towards it.\nThe Skeleton Soldiers here seemed to really like newbies, as they all greeted him without any suspicions. He was quite thankful for that.\n\"Nice to meet you, Paul!\"\n[My name’s not Paul, but... it’s nice to meet you...!]\n’The quest comes later. For now, let’s not leave this area, and grow in strength.’\nHe greeted the Skeleton Soldier, and the tip of his spear flashed, falling diagonally. And thus, the Antlion of the external passageway was born.\n[T-Traitor...]\n\"It’s unfortunate that you couldn’t remember your past life, Paul. We were the best of friends...\"\n[Keuhak!]\nLee Shin Woo stabbed the skull of the 138th Paul with his bone spear as hard as he could. The thickness and strength of his bone spear was incomparable to normal bone spears, and that bone spear cleanly smashed the skull of the 138th Paul. It left behind a bone, a bone spear, as well as 10 Perium before disappearing, just like the other Paul’s.\n\"Oh, this time it’s a leg bone.\"\nIt wasn’t like all Skeleton Soldiers left behind arm bones. After experimenting over 100 times, Lee Shin Woo was able to conclude that they dropped an arm bone, a leg bone, or mixed bones (the description explained that it was a bone of unknown origin). Amongst these, the mixed bones was a dud that didn’t increase stats, nor did it contain any skills, while the arm bone increased his proficiency in spearmanship and the leg bone...\n[You have reinforced your leg bone. You have acquired 5% proficiency in the skill, Beginner Sprint.]\n[No, I said now’s not the time to be swinging a spear! Goodness, there’s really an epidemic coming, I tell you! I’m getting out of here first! Different from you guys, faster than anyone! - A nameless soldier]\n[The Beginner Sprint skill has become Lv3. Your sprinting speed has become slightly faster.]\n\"Nice.\"\nThey had the effect of bestowing proficiency in the Skeleton Soldier’s sole movement-type skill, Sprint.\nThis skill allowed for a momentary, lightning-fast sprint, and was a skill that consumed a large amount of stamina, but to the undead which possessed the race characteristic of ’never tiring’, it was a great skill he’d be able to use again immediately after the skill delay.\n’Anyway, my stats didn’t increase again. Should I really get going now?’\nArm bones and legs bones, not mixed bones, would originally increase strength or agility by 1 each time he reinforced them, but at some point, the frequency of that growth had decreased, and now his stats wouldn’t rise even after absorbing 10 bones in a row.\nThough he had wanted to move after raising both his strength and agility to 100... Lee Shin Woo clicked his nonexistent tongue and checked his status.\n[Lee Shin Woo]\n[Normal Skeleton Blessed by God]\n[Lv - 1]\n[Strength - 57 Agility - 46 Health - 34 Magic - 6]\n[Passive skills - Invisible Heart Lv2, Beginner Spearmanship Lv3]\n[Active skills - Bone Reinforcement Lv1, Beginner Sprint Lv3]\n’They’re higher. They’re definitely higher, but...’\nThere were three things he wasn’t satisfied with.\nFirst off, mixed bones weren’t effective in improving his stats, which resulted in his health stat being lower than his strength or agility. He also hadn’t found a way to increase his magic stat, nor did he know how to use it. Lastly, he was still level 1, despite hunting down so many Skeleton Soldiers.\n’At this point, I might not be able to increase my level through normal hunting.’\nCertainly, the Skeleton Soldiers he had killed up until now had been much too strong, despite being level 1, and each Skeleton Soldier was different from the last. The fact that they were all level 1 was evidence that it wasn’t easy leveling up in this world.\n\"All the more reason to level up at least once before moving forward, but... I suppose it can’t be helped. Let’s move on to the next step.\"\nSince he had moved around the passageway while hunting, he knew the approximate location of the hideout. He had felt an obviously disparate energy leaking from a crack in the corner of the passageway.\nHe was sure, since the skeletons unconsciously avoided it, as they could feel the divine power within.\n’Ah, before that.’\nHe had a job to do before he got going. It was to upgrade his bone spear.\n[Would you like to sacrifice the Lv1 Bone Spear to reinforce the Lv1 Bone Spear (+9)?]\n\"Hoo...\"\nWhen Lee Shin Woo saw the message asking yes, or no, he took a short, deep breath. His hands trembled. He couldn’t help but do so when he recalled the process of creating the Bone Spear (+9), as well as the several bone spears that went into making it.\nThat’s right. Unlike normal reinforcement, bone equipment reinforcement had a failure rate. Of course, even if the reinforcement were to fail, the performance of the equipment wouldn’t drop, nor would it be damaged, but whenever he saw the bone spears disappearing for nothing, his heart would ache. Not that he had one.\n\"Ugh, reinforce...!\"\nBut what could he do about it? Even though he realized, in his heart, that it’d be more profitable to reinforce his bones rather than the spear at this point, he still couldn’t give up!\nSince this would be the last Skeleton Soldier he’d kill in the passageway anyway, he would let the spear cleanly oxidize for the last time and burn his own lingering attachment as well!\n[The reinforcement has succeeded. The Bone Spear has become Lv2.]\n... was what he was thinking when the reinforcement succeeded. Moreover, the Bone Spear had leveled up before him as a result! He might have to call it Lord Bone Spear, rather than Bone Spear now.\n\"Ooooooh!\"\nLee Shin Woo was deeply moved, cried (he couldn’t), and observed the reborn Lv2 Lord Bone Spear. The spear shaft had become around thirty centimeters longer than before, and the impressive blade gleamed with a menacing light.\n[Bone Spear]\n[Lv2]\n[Durability: 500/500]\n[Attack Power: 25 - 45]\n\"Oooooooh.\"\nThe maximum attack power of the Lv 1 Bone Spear (+9) had been 30, but a single reinforcement had increased it by 1.5x all at once. Not to mention the increase in durability. As expected, his investment into his weapon had paid off.\nLee Shin Woo rubbed his skull against the Lv2 Bone Spear’s sleek handle, emitting a squeaky sound, and was satisfied. Since he had earned the Lv2 Lord Bone Spear, he had nothing to fear anymore!\n[An unforeseen quest has occurred!]\nAt that very moment, a quest had occurred. Lee Shin Woo quickly began to resent Lord Bone Spear.\n[Ambush of the Treasure Eater]\n[Among the undead inhabiting the underground empire is a race called the Treasure Eaters that like to eat objects with magical energy within them. Normally, there isn’t anything that piques their interest in the external passageways, but the Lv2 item that you have created ended up stimulating one of the Treasure Eaters’ senses. It’s much stronger than a normal Skeleton Soldier to the point that it’s incomparable, but if you defeat it, you may be able to gain the treasure it has eaten.]\n[Quest Reward: The Treasure Eater’s treasure?]\n[Guoooooooooh!]\nThe moment that quest notification appeared, he heard a shriek from far beyond the passageways. At the same time, he heard something collapsing. There were also a few Skeleton Soldiers’ screams mixed in as well.\n[Kuaooooooh!]\nThe sound was coming closer by the second. A human... no, a skeleton... had just adapted to the situation, yet a new trial appeared as if to interfere with that adaptation. Perhaps that Treasure Eater didn’t appear naturally, and had been sent by God herself to torment him?\nAll sorts of doubts momentarily rushed through his mind, but the most important thing right now was deciding his course of action. Lee Shin Woo double checked the location of the hideout and quickly moved. First, he planned to check the Treasure Eater with his own two (nonexistent) eyes, and fight if it seemed doable.\n[Treasure Eater - Lv2]\n[Kuwoooooh!]\n\"Nope, I gotta run.\"\nBut when he saw the bug that had broken through the passageway floor, Lee Shin Woo decided to run without hesitation. That thing’s the same level as Lord Bone Spear! Updates are released by novel[f]ire.net\nThe moment he decided to flee, he activated his Sprint skill and ran towards the hideout. However, at that very moment, he got an announcement out of the blue.\n[Quest failed! However, the minimap has been added as a reward to the unforeseen quest.]\n\"What...?\"\nThe warm light that leaked between the cracks in the passageway immediately disappeared. The implication was so clear that he wanted to cry.\nHideouts could disappear!? Lee Shin Woo abruptly stopped and grit his teeth, and soon, the Treasure Eater had gotten close, greeting him by opening its mouth wide.\n[Kuhaaahk...!]\n\"Hi, Steve...?\"\n[Kuheeehk!]\nHe did his best to greet it like a cheerful skeleton, but it seemed like it didn’t like the name, Steve. Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and gripped Lord Bone Spear.\nIt was another fight.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 1 part3",
    "content": "<Chapter 1. Reinforcement Hero - 3>\n[Kuweeeeehk!]\nThe Treasure Eater charged at him with a shriek. Its jagged fence-like teeth within its open mouth radiated with a dull light.\n\"Sprint!\"[Kuhiaaaah!]\nIf he was chewed up by that thing, he knew it wouldn’t end with him dying only once or twice, so Lee Shin Woo completely abandoned any thought of a frontal assault. He activated his Sprint skill and ran away. Immediately after, the Treasure Eater brushed past his side and the following wind pressure felt as though a subway train had passed by him, and his bones itched. There was also the foul stench of rotting corpses.\n[Kueeeeeeh!]\nPerhaps it hadn’t expected that he’d dodge it so cleanly, and the Treasure Eater, that had labored in vain, shrieked again and twisted its body around. It seemed like it would take quite a long time for it to make a U-turn, as its body was too large when compared to the width of the passageway.\n\"Heup...!\"\nThis was his chance. Lee Shin Woo firmly gripped his spear with both hands and held it to his side. He subsequently pierced through the side of its body, as if he were shooting a cannon, and both of his hands creaked. He placed the full might of all of the stats he had stockpiled thus far into his Lv2 Bone Spear; the force behind the Bone Spear was truly tremendous!\n[Critical Hit!]\nHis spearmanship had been firmly tempered through the sacrifice of countless Pauls, resulting in a strike both heavy and sharp. The spear entered and split open its side, magnificently bursting open both its skin, and the flesh within. It was then that Lee Shin Woo realized that the concept of critical hits existed in this world.\n[Ggueeeeh!]\n\"W-Whoa!?\"\nBut he had only thought of attacking with all his might and hadn’t considered his next move. The moment the pained Treasure Eater turned its entire body, Lee Shin Woo failed to pull out the spear and crashed into the wall.\n\"Ah, ugh...!\"\nHe was afflicted by a pain that felt as though all his bones were being smashed. The pain was killing him, but he knew he would really die if he lost consciousness here, so he desperately maintained his consciousness. It helped here as well that he was undead.\n[Kwihehk!]\"Tch, this damned thing...!\"\nLee Shin Woo was trapped between the bug’s body and the wall; though he was receiving a shock that felt as though his body was being crushed to pieces, he used all his might, grabbed the spear, and pulled it out, causing dead flesh and blood to burst out.\n[Ggueeeeeeh!]\nAt that moment, the bug screeched like a pig, filling the passageway with its screams.\n[The Treasure Eater used Shriek of the Dead. Those exposed to this shriek will momentarily enter a frenzied state.][As an effect of Invisible Heart, you ignore the effects of Shriek of the Dead.]\nThe effects behind its shriek were ignored due to the effects of Invisible Heart! However, Lee Shin Woo was moving without seeing that message. To be exact, he aimed for the moment it shrieked, as it stopped moving while doing so, to attack the same area he had attacked last time. He believed he’d be able to land another critical hit by attacking the same area.\n[Gguaaaahk!]\"Tch!\"\nHowever, was he still lacking in skill to intentionally land a critical hit? Although he had thought he had timed it perfectly, his attack missed. Compared to last time, his attack was only able to create a smaller hole. Still, the fact that he could withdraw his spear and retreat immediately following his attack was progress, compared to last time. However, at that moment, a message update appeared.\n[Beginner Spearmanship has become Lv4. You can swing your spear more easily now.]\n\"Huh...?\"\nLee Shin Woo briefly voiced out in surprise. That’s because Beginner Spearmanship had leveled up to Lv3 upon killing the 133rd Paul. It hadn’t been long since it had leveled up, yet it had leveled up again, so he couldn’t help but be surprised. However, he obviously didn’t have the time to look into that right now. Like the message had said, it felt much lighter than before. He gripped his spear and got ready to use his Sprint skill again.\n[Gguaaahk!]\nThe Treasure Eater had successfully managed to change directions, despite being attacked, and opened its mouth wide, seemingly intent on swallowing both him and the treasure whole.\n\"Ugh... Sprint!\"[Kueeeeh!]\nAt the end of their split-second battle of wits, Lee Shin Woo dodged its charge again and flung his body. Though it was a dangerous moment that would determine life or death, he was able to dodge its charge with more ease than before. That’s because the Treasure Eater charged in a straight line, and he had used his Sprint skill to accelerate at the crucial moment.\nIf he didn’t possess a skeleton’s body which enabled him to utilize Sprint repeatedly, the battle would’ve already been over. Conversely, it meant that he was confident that he’d be able to keep up with it as long as he wanted.\n\"Nice, then...\"\nLee Shin Woo concluded that he’d need to prolong the fight, so he abandoned all thoughts of attacking, and decided to damage it little by little. He would use the reach of the Bone Spear at mid-range to nibble away at its body!\n\"Eat this!\"[Kuaaaahk!]\nThe Bone Spear quickly stabbed its rear end, splattering blood. Lee Shin Woo had successfully attacked, and he immediately retreated to a safe distance and observed the Treasure Eater.However, its response was strange. Lee Shin Woo had expected that it would go wild like last time, but it ignored his predictions and had curled up as much as possible...\n[Kihiiiiiiiiiiih!]\"Argh.\"\nIt yelled its most annoying and unpleasant shriek to date! Lee Shin Woo grit his teeth to endure its intense, skull-ringing shriek. And there was a truly teeth-gritting scene before his very eyes.\n[The Treasure Eater uses the Roar of Healing.][The Treasure Eater’s health recovers completely.]\nThe wounds that Lee Shin Woo had risked his life to inflict were being healed in real time!\n\"Steve, you asshole...\"[Kuwooooooh!]\nIt was just an external passageway monster, but it was healing up like a boss monster! He was even more annoyed by the fact that he had no way of figuring out how many times it could use the Roar of Healing. If it could use the Roar of Healing repeatedly, then this struggle would be meaningless.\n\"Ah, that’s so demoralizing.\"[Kuoooooh!]\nHe felt as though his blood sugar was dropping, but it was just a misunderstanding. After all, he was nothing but bones so there’s no way for his blood sugar to drop. Lee Shin Woo weakly gripped his spear. He could do nothing but act on the assumption that right now, the Treasure Eater couldn’t use its Roar of Healing indefinitely. And if not? Then he’d have to run away no matter what by using Sprint!\nIt was then.\n[Monster discovered... during patrol...!][Requesting reinforcements...!]\n\"Huh...?\"\nLee Shin Woo couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He had definitely heard the voice of a Skeleton Soldier beyond the completely collapsed passageway!Moreover, thanks to the Treasure Eater rampaging everywhere, the upper, lower, and side passageways had all collapsed, and the Skeleton Soldiers were coming out from everywhere. Of course, the Treasure Eater had absolutely no interest in the soldiers equipped with lousy bone spears, but Lee Shin Woo was different.\n’Are these guys really coming to help me?’[Requesting additional reinforcements...!][In the middle of requesting reinforcements...!][Discovered something... fighting the monster...]\nOne of the Skeleton Soldiers discovered Lee Shin Woo confronting the monster. The skeleton tilted its head when it saw Lee Shin Woo’s larger frame, compared to other skeletons (his body became slightly larger as his stats increased), and the shiny bone spear in his hand, ultimately asking.\n[Are you a newbie...?]\"Yeah, I’m a newbie! Help me!\"\nLee Shin Woo yelled distressingly. It seemed like the skeleton couldn’t grasp the situation, as it stood there vacantly for a second, but soon, came up to the passageway, and pointed its spear towards the Treasure Eater.\n[Participating... Hunting together...]\"Pauuuuul!\"\nRight after Lee Shin Woo shouted in gratitude, a message appeared before his eyes.\n[You have achieved the feat of deceiving your enemies and manipulating them. Surviving using everything you have may be the most important talent in the Empire.][You have learned the passive skill, Acting Lv1.]\n\"...\"\nIt felt slightly strange that this was the first skill he had obtained through his own efforts, but he’d use it as much as possible if it would keep him alive! Lee Shin Woo sneakily took a step back from the Treasure Eater and yelled in an even louder voice.\n\"Pauls, let’s beat this monster together! It’s a thief that’s threatening the security of our Empire!\"[Request complete... Participating.][Participating.]\"Hey you, yes you. Come over here!\"[Helping... the newbie...][Participating.]\nMore Skeleton Soldiers aggressively participated in the battle, and even those from further away, the more of a fuss he made. There were those who would wait and see, but when Lee Shin Woo personally pointed them out and asked for their help, they couldn’t just ignore him. Who would’ve thought that the first aid training[1] from the military would help here?\n[Kuoooh!][Hunting... the monster.][The bug that threatens... the Empire!]\nThe Treasure Eater disregarded the Skeleton Soldiers when more than 10 had gathered and lunged at Lee Shin Woo, but when the number had instantly surpassed 20, it seemed to panic, and change its tactics.\n[Kuwooooooh!][The Treasure Eater used Shriek of the Dead. Those exposed to this shriek will momentarily enter a frenzied state.][As an effect of Invisible Heart, you ignore the effects of Shriek of the Dead.]\n\"Ah, I forgot about that.\"[There are a lot of enemies...!][Where are you aiming, that’s... an afterimage...!]\nUnlike Lee Shin Woo, the other skeletons were powerless before the Shriek of the Dead, and the skeletons that had died from infighting were quickly replaced by new ones. It seemed as though all the Skeleton Soldiers in the external passageways were gathering here.\n[Kuwooh, Kuwooooooh!][The Treasure Eater tried to use the Shriek of the Dead, but it failed due to the lack of mana.]\n\"Oh, so that’s how it is.\"\nWhile the Treasure Eater tried to repeatedly use its Shriek of the Dead, a message had appeared notifying him that it had failed due to a lack of mana!At this point, it’s highly likely that the Treasure Eater wouldn’t be able to use its Roar of Healing either. All of the risk factors had disappeared.\n\"Good, Paul. Use the siege destruction formation[2]!\"\n[Attacking...!][Killing the enemy!]\nAh, it’s a line he’d wanted to say at least once in his life. Lee Shin Woo was moved, wiping the resulting (nonexistent) tears, and then gripped his bone spear. Of course, even if it had depleted all its mana, the Treasure Eater’s physical abilities didn’t change and was wiping out the Skeleton Soldiers with relative ease. It would be easier for Shin Woo if it wiped out a lot of them. Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs N()velFire.net\n\"Wow, this year’s harvest is great!\"\nHe muttered satisfyingly as he saw the bones scattered around him, then gripped his spear and charged at the Treasure Eater. The battle ended just five minutes later. It was a complete victory.\n[1] T/N: Probably refers to the steps of first aid (e.g. accessing the situation, getting someone’s attention, etc.).\n[2] T/N: It’s a meme. It’s the name that the protagonist gives his formation of 300 strong that encircles and defeats a monster army of 5000. It’s from this Japanese web novel:\"最下位職から最強まで成り上がる〜地道な努力はチートでした〜.\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 1. Reinforcement Hero - 4>\n[You have defeated a Lv2 Treasure Eater. You have achieved a feat of defeating an enemy with a higher level than you. Your Strength and Health permanently increase by 2.]\n[As a reward for your achievement, the proficiency of your combat-related skills have been increased. The Beginner Sprint skill has become Lv4.]\n[Quest complete! Please check the treasure that the Treasure Eater left behind.]\n[You have gained the minimap. If you close your eyes, you will be able to see the minimap.]\n[We won...]\n[We defeated the monster. I need rest...]\nThere were only two Pauls... or Skeleton Soldiers that had survived until the end of the battle. Lee Shin Woo hadn’t tried to save them, but they had managed to survive. However, all their bones were cracked in the aftermath of the fierce battle, and it was difficult for them to even stand!\n\"Paul, I’ll never forget the time we spent together.\"\n[Ugh!?]\n[What are you doing... keuahk!]\nLee Shin Woo forcefully embraced the two skeletons, who had gone through hardship with him. By doing so, he completely broke through the threshold of their health, and they crumbled to pieces.\nSilence finally dawned upon the clearing (the passageway had significantly widened and become a clearing), that had been filled with the cries of the Treasure Eater, and the rattling sound of skeleton bones. He was the champion.\n[The Acting Skill has become Lv2.]\n\"That’s amazing timing... phew. I’m dying too.\"\nThough he was victorious, Lee Shin Woo had received a lot of physical and mental damage. His bone joints ached, and he even saw a part that was cracked. It hurt so much that he thought it might be better to die once and come back!\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo didn’t do that. It would be a waste to use his Invisible Heart like that, and he already knew of a method to restore his bones. That was...\n’Now, let’s start reinforcing, shall we?’\nHis eyes quickly scanned his surroundings. The bones and the Bone Spears of the skeletons that had died fighting here were piled in the dozens. There were also dozens of black coins, too.\nThat wasn’t all. There was a distinct bone, compared to the skeletons’ bones, that remained in the area where the Treasure Eater had died, as well as something shiny, causing Lee Shin Woo’s heart to flutter. It had been worth it to overcome this ordeal (though it was mostly the skeletons)!\n\"I’ll put aside the delicious one for later.\"\nHe suppressed his desire to check the Treasure Eater’s loot and picked up the nearby skeleton bone first.\nThey were mixed bones, but it was for the better. Increasing his strength or agility through an arm or leg bone had nearly reached its limit and increasing his health through mixed bones was much more effective right now.\n[You have reinforced your tailbone. Health has increased by 1. Absorbing a portion of the Skeleton Soldier’s memories and experiences.]\n[I-I’m pretty sure my tailbone just broke. Really! - A nameless soldier]\n\"If these guys knew they could leave behind memories of their life, they wouldn’t have left behind such useless memories...\"\nLee Shin Woo stroked his tailbone and felt that the cracks had definitely decreased, compared to before the Reinforcement. And he repeated the Reinforcement process.\nThe more he repeated the Reinforcement, the more his stats and skill proficiency would slightly increase, and simultaneously, the cracks on his entire body began to cleanly disappear, as if they had been erased by an eraser.\n\"Huh?\"\nWhile Reinforcing, Lee Shin Woo found an unexpected item. He had picked up a bone that wasn’t an arm bone, a leg bone, or mixed bones.\n[Skeleton Soldier’s rib bone.]\n[A bone left behind by a Skeleton Soldier who had strong bones.]\n\"So, this kind of thing can happen, too.\"\nWas it a rare drop? Lee Shin Woo was slightly excited and sacrificed it to reinforce his ribs.\n[You have reinforced your ribs. Health has increased by 2. Absorbing a portion of the Skeleton Soldier’s memories and experience.]\n[General Seagald has committed treason...? That’s not possible. I’ll trust him and follow him to the end. - A nameless soldier.]\n\"I don’t think that’s a line a nameless soldier would say, though!?\"\nWhat exactly did General Seagald do? He didn’t know what he did, but in any case, raising 2 points in Health was awesome. He decided to remember the name, General Seagald, and absorbed the remaining bones one after another. His appearance was akin to a farmer who was harvesting his crops.\n\"Now, it’s time to upgrade the Bone Spear...\"\nHe looked at the mountain of Bone Spears that he had collected while absorbing the bones and looked like he was at a loss. It had been so hard to reinforce the Lv1 Bone Spear, so he couldn’t imagine how many Bone Spears would break in the process of reinforcing the Lv2 Bone Spear.\n\"Phew. But there’s no helping it. I gotta do it.\"\nHe had realized the importance of weapons several times during his fight with the Treasure Eater. A single attack from his spear had been more effective than 10 attacks from the other Skeleton Soldiers! He took a short, deep breath, and extended his hand towards the mountain of Bone Spears.\n[Reinforcement has failed.]\n[Reinforcement has failed.]\n[Reinforcement has failed.]\n[Reinforcement has succeeded!]\n\"Oh!\"\nHe had succeeded in only 4 tries! He had thought that Lv1 items may be unable to reinforce Lv2 items, but Lee Shin Woo became confident after his single success and began to reinforce, one after another.\n[Reinforcement has failed.] x30\n\"Please no, don’t be like that. No!\"\n[Reinforcement has failed.]\n[Reinforcement has failed.]\n[Reinforcement has failed.]\n...\n[Reinforcement has succeeded!]\n[Reinforcement has succeeded!]\n[Bone Spear +3]\n[Lv2]\n[Durability: 590/590]\n[Attack Power: 33 - 57]\n’Ugh, I don’t know what the probability is, so I don’t know if it went well or not.’\nWhen he was about to run out of Bone Spears, the final two Reinforcements had succeeded, and as a result, the Bone Spear became a Bone Spear +3.\nLee Shin Woo had quickly used up all the Bone Spears, and a part of him felt that it had been a waste but decided to be satisfied with the fact that his Bone Spear had definitely gotten stronger.\n\"Now, then...\"\nIt was finally time for the main dish he had been saving. His bone joints rattled displeasingly as he approached the place where the Treasure Eater had died. The first thing he saw was a heaping pile of Perium. He extended his hand towards the pile, and a message appeared.\n[You have acquired 1,250 Perium.]\n\"Whew.\"\nWhere exactly was this Perium currency used? No, could it even be used? He had picked them up instinctively due to his past game experience, but he couldn’t make sense of them. While he was at it, he checked how much money was stored in his pouch; he had gathered 3,340 Perium up until now.\n’The money pouch is starting to get heavy. Is there no inventory here?’\nPerhaps he would gain an inventory by completing a quest, like how he had received the minimap. Then, he picked up the Treasure Eater’s bone next.\nAs expected, since the Treasure Eater was much larger than those pathetic Skeleton Soldiers, a single one of its bones was larger than Lee Shin Woo.\n[Would you like to reinforce your bones with the Treasure Eater’s lower jaw bone? You can reinforce your lower jaw bone.]\n\"This really pisses me off...\"\nThis probably wasn’t even its entire lower jaw bone, but just a portion of it. It was the area commonly called the jawbone, and just the thought of sacrificing it to reinforce his bones caused his skin (even though he didn’t have any) to feel goosebumps.\nHowever... he didn’t really have any other choice. He shrugged his shoulders and proceeded with the Reinforcement.\n[The Bone Reinforcement skill has become Lv2. The effectiveness of bone absorption increases.]\n[You have reinforced your lower jaw bone. Strength has increased by 1, Health by 1, and Magic by 5. Absorbing a portion of the Treasure Eater’s memories and experiences.]\n[Kuwaaaaaaaahk! Kuheeeeeeeeeehk! - Treasure Eater]\n\"...\"\nLee Shin Woo, who felt the faint memories seep into his body, was briefly silent. He shivered, as the Treasure Eater’s shriek in the message felt slightly, really slightly, affectionate. If he were to somehow meet another Treasure Eater, he felt as though he’d be able to understand what the Treasure Eater was saying, albeit a little.\n\"In any case, it increased my magic, so let’s leave it at that.\"\nHe might’ve gained a skill, but most of the memories and experiences he gained through Bone Reinforcement didn’t immediately manifest as skills and would require a bit of time. Most of the time, the skill would only awaken at the right time.\nIf it was a skill though, he’d like to gain that Roar of Healing for sure... Lee Shin Woo earnestly prayed and extended his hand towards the final item that also doubled as the quest reward.\n[Feather Bone Boots +1]\n[Lv2]\n[Durability: 256/320]\n[Defense: 25 - 35]\n[Options: Agility +5, Sprint skill +1]\n\"Wow...\"\nTo think, an item could have both stats and skills. This was truly a treasure that was in a completely different league when compared to the similarly leveled Lv2 Bone Spear!\nLee Shin Woo carefully put the bone boots on his feet. There was a slight problem; since both Lee Shin Woo and the boots were made of bone, it was difficult to figure out whether the boots were an item or the bones of someone with stupidly large feet. But considering the fact that his body felt lighter when he put the boots on, it was definitely the effect of an item.\n[Lee Shin Woo]\n[Normal Skeleton Blessed by God]\n[Lv - 1]\n[Strength - 65 Agility - 55 + 5 Health - 48 Magic - 11]\n[Passive skills - Invisible Heart Lv2, Beginner Spearmanship Lv4, Acting Lv2]\n[Active skills - Bone Reinforcement Lv2, Beginner Sprint Lv4 +1]\n\"Nice.\"\nLee Shin Woo grinned as he looked at his stats; it had certainly changed as a result of the battle.\nHis health, which had been lacking compared to his other stats, had been supplemented to a certain degree, and his magic slightly rose as well. He was sure that he had successfully sublimated the Skeleton Soldiers’ battle experience into his own, to a certain degree, in the previous battle. Newest update provıded by novel_fіre.net\n\"Let’s see if I die again...\"\nThe moment he died in a car accident flashed through his mind. Lee Shin Woo grit his teeth and shook his head, shaking off the memory. He resolved to never die again. Whether this place was a cursed Underground Empire or the middle of a galactic war, he would survive no matter what.\n[A quest has occurred!]\nThe moment he made his vow, a well-timed quest occurred. It was as though God had been listening and decided to intervene at just the right time.\n[Infiltrate the Empire]\n[You have remarkably taken down the Treasure Eater and grown.

    "content": "<Chapter 2. God’s Secret Shop - 1>\n\"If I close my eyes... ooh, oooh.\"\nWhen he closed his (nonexistent) eyes, he could see it as an extremely intuitive image. It felt as though there was another eye centered on him that watched from above and scanned the entire area. And within that area, only the correct path shined brightly.\n’...Shall I go?’\nThere wasn’t much more he could gain from staying here. Lee Shin Woo made up his mind, opened his eyes, and started moving along the confirmed path. The clearing had stagnated from silence to dead quiet, and only the sound of his moving footsteps rang out. His footsteps had gotten a lot quieter, perhaps due to the Feather Bone Boots.\n’Hoo.’\nThe passageway was quite long. Various parts of the passageway had collapsed thanks to the Treasure Eater’s rampage. In order to reach those places, Lee Shin Woo had to at times jump high, and at other times jump far. He eventually came to, in a sense, the obvious realization: the Sprint skill could be used in tandem with his jump.\n’If I become proficient in my Sprint skill, then time it, no, I may become a skeleton who can run in the sky... Ah.’\nAs he walked through the continuing passageway, the atmosphere in the passageway changed in no time. If it seemed as though he had been reluctantly trudging through the underground passageway, filled with nothing but rocks and sand thus far, then this current area is the first place to have a clear path.\n’This is the real Empire... I can see the walls.’\nThere was a clear distinction between the external passageways and the genuine Underground Empire: the castle walls. According to the quest’s explanation, he would have to face Skeleton Soldiers over there again. Honestly, he didn’t think he’d lose to a few Skeleton Soldiers now, but he couldn’t release his tension, so long as he couldn’t ascertain how many of them there were.\n[Halt...]\nLee Shin Woo stopped, his bone joints rattling. There was a single, imposing platoon of skeletons atop the castle walls, aiming their bone arrows at him. Yet, their numbers were small. They soon disclosed that reason themselves.\n[The monster... was it hunted...?]\"Yeah, we got it! Though, everyone else died except for me...\"\nNow, he could start acting at the flick of a switch. A part of the soldiers that guarded the walls were probably sent to hunt the Treasure Eater!This all happened because Lee Shin Woo had made a huge fuss. He lauded his foresight, which he hadn’t even been aware of, and continued to speak.\n\"Paul, please open the castle gate for me. I have to return to guard duty too.\"[Wait... just a minute...]\nIt seemed like this quest would go smoothly. However, had he jinxed it? One of the skeletons wielding a bone bow rattled its teeth as it spoke.\n[I haven’t seen that... spear before...]\"The Treasure Hunter dropped it.\"\nLee Shin Woo, who was only focused on entering the Empire, roughly concocted a plausible story. But the soldier’s response caused his (nonexistent) heart to pound.\n[Then... report it to your superiors...]\"Huh?\"[I’ll... report it.]\nNo wait, he didn’t think their military discipline was this strict. Moreover, superiors? Doesn’t that mean someone stronger than them will come? He felt pressed and requested.\n\"Hey, Paul. Wait a sec. I’ll give the report myself, so open the gates first.\"[The report... comes first...]\nReport-then-action? Damn it! They hadn’t even thought of complimenting and taking care of a comrade who had returned with great difficulty, and instead, would call their superiors when they heard the news that he had picked up a new item. You damn egotistic and ambitious skeletons!\n\"I said I’d be the one to report it!\" Since it came to this, there was no need to hide anymore. If that superior arrived, he’d definitely die at least once! He clicked his tongue and sprinted. The Skeleton Soldiers were startled and aimed their bone bows at him.\n[Are you... revolting against the Empire?][Are you trying... to embezzle?][Is it corruption[1]...?]\n\"Sprint!\"\nHe completely ignored what the skeletons were saying and jumped while using his Sprint and clung to the castle wall. Surprisingly, it was possible for him to jump close to 2m high. Even though he was only at the tutorial level, he thought that he had already transcended humanity, and belatedly realized that he was no longer physically human.\n[Attack... Subduing.] [Subduing.]\nThe Skeleton Soldiers determined that he was their enemy and began to aim and shoot their arrows at him. Though he planned to get hit by a few of them, when the arrows closed in on him, his hand, holding the bone spear, moved by itself. ’Huh!?’It happened in a split second. Right after he grasped the trajectory of the arrows with the naked eye, he instinctively swung his bone spear and parried two arrows! The arrows he couldn’t block hit his shoulder, but the damage was minor.\n[You have learned the passive skill, Beginner Weapon Defense Lv1.]\nThat wasn’t all. When he thought he needed to stop the skeletons from drawing their bowstrings again, he naturally opened his mouth and shrieked.\n\"Kuhwaaaaaaahk!\"\n[You have learned the active skill, Beginner Shriek of the Dead Lv1.][By using the Shriek of the Dead, the enemies in the entire area have momentarily fallen into a frenzied state.]\nHe didn’t know how he had learned Beginner Weapon Defense yet, but the source of the Shriek of the Dead was clear. It was the Treasure Eater! He had wanted to learn the Roar of Healing, but the results were contrary to his expectations.\n[You bastards... just when did you infiltrate...!][I’ll... kill you...!]\nHe felt momentarily dizzy since he had used the Shriek of the Dead with his low mana, but its effects were astounding. The Skeleton Soldiers treated each other as enemies and started to attack each other!Lee Shin Woo aimed for that opportunity, exerting himself, and crawling up the wall. He felt motion sickness due to his unreasonable use of mana, but he grit his teeth and endured.\n[W-What about that guy?] \"I’m right behind you.\"[Ugh!?]\nBy the time the Skeleton Soldiers escaped the status ailment, Lee Shin Woo was already atop the castle wall! There’s no way arrows would be effective at close range. Lee Shin Woo cold-bloodedly swung the Lv2 Lord Bone Spear and broke them in a single strike. It was a quick and clean finish.\n[You have hunted a Skeleton Archer.][You have hunted a Skeleton Archer.]\nFor a brief moment, the castle walls regained its silence. Lee Shin Woo grabbed and removed the arrow lodged in his shoulder and sighed. Though he had been slightly injured, he had stopped them from reporting to their sup...\n\"...The hell is this?\"\nAfter he had climbed atop the castle wall, he was finally able to see the scenery beyond. Since the walls of the castle had remained intact, he had thought that the city within would look like it was from the middle ages... but there was a different sight before him, as though it were mocking his naiveté.\n\"Is this the demon world or something...?\"\nA city? Perhaps it may have been called that some time ago. However, all the buildings were weathered, decayed, entangled with weeds here and there... it was already ruined, without any proper buildings remaining.The entrance was the only thing barely intact. When he looked further ahead, he saw plains, covered in thick grass, and a sandy desert mixed together conflictingly. If this were like a game, it was as if the developers had tried implementing both a desert map and a plains map at the same time, but the two maps had clashed and failed.\n\"What superiors?\"\nThere’s no way there would be any military systems left intact here. The skeletons here were just souls trapped in the past. And those he would have to face from now on were probably the same. Even if he thought he was conversing with them, there was no actual conversation going on at all.\n\"Ha...\"\nLee Shin Woo suddenly realized what situation he had been dumped into, sighed softly, and shrugged his shoulders.Honestly, before he had come here, when God had told him that she wanted him to purify this place, he felt something like ’I don’t really care, but if I can come back to life, I might as well.’, but now he felt like he wanted to fix this place, at least to rid himself of his uneasiness.\n’First, let’s pick up the loot.’\nHe couldn’t just sit thinking forever. Lee Shin Woo collected the scattered Perium atop the castle wall, as well as the Skeleton Archers’ bones, bone bows, and bone arrows. Strangely, their finger bones remained, and when he reinforced himself with them, the message was the same among them.[You have reinforced your finger bone. Agility has increased by 1. Absorbing a portion of the Skeleton Archer’s memories and experiences.][Why are you putting an apple on my head? ... Wait a second, fine, I’ll learn archery! Jeez, I said I’ll learn it! - A nameless boy] Compared to his leg bones, which he had reinforced to the limits and which wouldn’t really raise in agility, whenever he reinforced his finger bones, his agility would raise with a high probability.\n[You have acquired a Lv1 Bone Short Bow.][You have learned Beginner Archery Lv1.]\n\"That’s right, I had expected this too.\"\nHe searched the entire area and used all the finger bones he found to reinforce himself. As a result, even without the effects of the Feather Bone Boots, his agility had risen to 62, and his Beginner Archery rose to Lv2, even though he hadn’t shot a single arrow yet.\nHe continued, combining (reinforcing) the less than 10 Bone Short bows into one.\n[Bone Short Bow +4][Lv1][Durability: 220/220][Attack Power: 20 - 25]\n\"This ain’t half-bad.\"Though its attack power was incomparable to the Lv2 Bone Spear, he felt reassured, now that he had acquired a way to attack from a distance. He felt even better since there were almost 200 arrows stored in the castle walls.\n[Quest complete!][You have acquired an inventory. You can open and close it by shouting the inventory command.][You have acquired a permit to access god’s secret shop. You can open it by shouting the shop command.] Content orıginally comes from novel{f}ire.net\n\"Wow.\"\nAfter he finished collecting the loot, climbed down the walls without much thought, and set foot in the Empire’s territory, Lee Shin Woo saw messages in front of him, one after another.He was lost in thought, so he had forgotten that he had been in the middle of a quest, so Lee Shin Woo was briefly surprised, and inwardly cheered. After all, he couldn’t carry 200 arrows all at once.\n\"Inventory.\"\nHe muttered, and a checkered, transparent window appeared in front of him that he often saw in games. Lee Shin Woo muttered, saying it was an intuitive inventory, and when he touched the window, his hand was powerlessly sucked in. He was startled and pulled his hand out, but his hand was fine.\n’Will this work?’\nHe grabbed a bone arrow and put it inside. The bone arrow was instantly sucked in, and an arrow icon appeared on one of the checkered boxes. The x1 sign next to it was a bonus.\n\"Let’s see.\"\nHe shoved all his bone arrows into his inventory. The sign instantly shot up to x189. He wasn’t absolutely sure yet, but he felt like he’d be able to stack the same item inside, as long as they were identical. Since the inventory, divided into checkered boxes, currently only had 10 boxes, when he realized that they could stack, he was more than a little relieved.\n\"Let’s put the bow in... ah, money too.\"\nWhen he threw the money pouch inside, the pouch disappeared somewhere, and a black coin icon appeared below the inventory, along with the amount 3,420. He honestly wanted to compliment it because of how intuitive it was.\n\"Good, close.\"\nHowever, it didn’t close. He thought perhaps it would close if he muttered ’inventory’, and when he did, the inventory completely disappeared.Lee Shin Woo suddenly had an idea and he muttered inventory in his head without saying it out loud. The inventory opened. With this, he’d be able to open and close the inventory amid battle without much difficulty.\n’Then next up...’\nWith this, he completely understood the inventory. Lee Shin Woo took a deep breath again and muttered the command of the other reward.\n\"Shop.\"\nAt that moment, the surrounding area distorted. At the same time, even Lee Shin Woo’s consciousness became faint. He tried opening his eyes in an attempt to get a hold of himself no matter what, then...\n\"Guten morgen [2], Mr. Skeleton.\"\nHe had arrived in God’s secret shop.\n[1] T/N: This term doesn’t have a specific enough English equivalent. It’s when you perform illegal activities because you need the money. Typically refers to politics.\n[2] T/N: Good morning in German.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 2 part2",
    "content": "<Chapter 2. God’s Secret Shop - 2>\nWhen he came to, he was no longer in the Empire, but somewhere else. It was an enclosed space, with silver walls emitting a delicate light on all four sides, and one of those sides was the ’store’. The secret shop permit gave him permission to come to this place.\n\"Why are you just staring at me? I’m sorry but I’m not for sale.\"\nLee Shin Woo tilted his head when he saw the woman behind the counter look back at him with a bewitching smile.\n\"... Have we met somewhere before?\"\"Oh my, are you hitting on me? Unfortunately, your body’s not my type.\"\"I’m not hitting on you, you know. Even if I were, it wouldn’t matter.\"\nShe spoke while laughing annoyingly, and Lee Shin Woo became short-tempered. He had accepted that he was an undead now, but he needed more time before he accepted his impotence! Even so, the woman, the storekeeper, giggled.\n\"Ah yes, you’re right. Aw, how sad.\"\nThe storekeeper was a remarkable beauty with burning red hair. Her red, bobbed hair trailed down to bottom of her neck, and slowly shimmered and swayed as if it were actually fire. Yes, Lee Shin Woo had seen that almost living red hair before; he had seen it just recently.\n\"Are you God?\"\"There’s no way God would be that free. Are all people with red hair gods, then?\"\"Ugh...\"\nIndeed, she looked different from the God that Lee Shin Woo remembered. By Earth standards, God looked both eastern and western, had truly strange physical features (ears, eyes, mouth, and nose), and looked like a 10 year old girl, and a 60 year old lady at the same time, such that it was difficult to tell.On the other hand, the woman in front of him was different. She looked energetic and in her early 20s, and had western physical features as well. Her hair was shorter, and her red eyes were different from God’s (God’s eyes glimmered in five different colors). But he was sure of one thing: she was an undeniable beauty. That was her only similarity to God.\"If I were to explain... yes, think of me as a priestess. My role, given to me by God, is to supply my customers, that is, heroes, what they need in return for the proper price. I follow God’s orders, so I’m a merchant and a priestess at the same time.\"\"If a hero needs something, you should just give it to them for free.\"\"Hehe.\"\nShe’d probably heard that a lot from the other heroes until now. She narrowed her eyes and explained.\n\"You know the term ’karma’, right? Karma exists in everything in this world. When you are accomplishing a special feat, perfecting a special skill... or even killing others; you gain karma.\"\"Then are levels and stats a kind of karma, too?\"\"It’s nice that you catch on quick. You’re right, They are a type of karma. And customer, by using that karma as a price, you’re able to receive a different ’karma’ in return. The karma I receive in return for my items is... Perium.\"\nThe explanation was long, but it just meant that achievements, skill training, and killing would allow him to raise his level and stats and that the Perium he received from killing monsters could be used to buy items. When Lee Shin Woo heard that Perium was also a type of karma, he took out a portion of his karma from his inventory and looked at it thoroughly, but as expected, he couldn’t figure anything out. It seemed as though the woman was used to it, and continued. Follow current novels on n͟o͟v͟e͟l͟f͟i͟r͟e͟.net\n\"Customer, you don’t have the ability to process, or use it in another place yet. It will be much more helpful to you if you just buy items from me.\"\"... Then, one more question. You said that levels are also a type of karma, but why haven’t I leveled up yet when I’ve killed so many monsters?\"\nThe merchant’s smile thickened. Levels were a number that represented one’s league and was also this world’s standard of absolute strength. Lee Shin Woo mentioned it so casually, so she pitied him.\n\"I don’t know what levels you’re talking about, but levels in this world aren’t something that can be raised that easily. You have to gather an appropriate level of karma to level up. And the most typical example of that karma are stats.\"\"Then to become level 2...\" \"All your stats combined must become 200, solely from your body, excluding all items or temporary buffs. It’s easy to understand, isn’t it?\"\n’200? How and when am I supposed to get that much’, is what he wanted to say, but when he added up all his stats, he was already at 186. That meant that he could raise his level when he raised his stats by 14 more.\n\"But you don’t need to be in such a rush to level up. You see, what you did to get to that level is just as important as the level up itself. Whether it’s by a special feat or a skill, other types of karma are important as well. Well, you’ll see once you’ve experienced it yourself.\"\nIt seems like level ups aren’t simply a change in number in this world. That means that... it might mean a job change? In any case, it would happen soon, so just like the merchant said, he’d find out for sure once he experienced it himself.He was briefly lost in thought, and the merchant tapped the counter to snap him out of it.\n\"I think I’ve explained enough, back to the point that I should receive karma in exchange for goods. Would you like to buy something now, customer?\"\"What do you sell?\"\"I sell everything, aside from what I don’t have. First off, potions.\"\"Hmm...\"\nHe really didn’t feel like he needed potions, setting aside whether a skeleton could even drink a potion or not. That’s because his injuries could be healed through Bone Reinforcement.\n\"Next are magic books.\"\"Hm...\"\nMagic books, huh. Perhaps he might need them later, but not now. He didn’t even have enough mana for the Shriek of the Dead and he could only use it once, so what would he do by learning magic? If he hadn’t learned the Shriek of the Dead, he might’ve thought about it, but since he already had a skill that could turn the tides of battle, it didn’t really feel very appealing to him right now.\n\"But you won’t be able to buy them right now since you don’t have enough Perium. Of course, we also have equipment that you can wear.\"\"Equipment, huh. As I thought, I’d really like to see th...\"\"Ah, and finally we have bones.\"\"Bones!?\"\"Bones.\"\nLee Shin Woo, who was about to buy equipment, stopped moving and talking at once without hesitation. They sold bones? What if he was right, and they were the bones he was thinking about? He wondered why they sold such a thing and he tilted his head, while the merchant’s expression remained calm.\n\"There are bones scattered around the Empire, so there’s no way our shop wouldn’t sell them. The other heroes don’t have a Bone Reinforcement skill, so they would mostly sell them to me at a cheap price.\"\"Of course.\"\nSince he didn’t really have anything worth selling right now, this didn’t mean anything to him right now, but it would change in the future. He had an inventory that could store pretty much anything now. Lee Shin Woo decided that he’d pick up stuff he didn’t immediately need in the future and nodded his head. And he told her the type of item he wanted.\n\"Please show me the bones.\"\"Hehe, I knew you’d say that customer, so I had them prepared.\"\nHe pondered between the equipment and the bones, but most of his strength came from his Bone Reinforcement skill, so he went with the bones.He simply thought that bones were, of course, better since they’d permanently increase his abilities, rather than equipment which he would have to change eventually, but it was mostly due to his experience with Bone Reinforcement, and the variety of abilities he could gain from it.\n’There’s, of course, the possibility of gaining skills, but I can’t deny that the original owner’s memories within the bones are greatly affecting my combat abilities.’\nLee Shin Woo knew well. The reason he, who hadn’t learnt any martial arts on Earth, could get this far and put up a decent fight against the Treasure Eater, was because he had indirectly gained the combat experience from absorbing the Skeleton Soldiers’ bones.\nThe true ability of Bone Reinforcement wasn’t just the increase in stats or the acquisition of skills. It was inheriting the innate experiences and memories that only others had! If he continued to gather these, it would eventually become his strength, and no one else’s, that would surpass everyone.\n\"Oh my, customer. You have 3,420 Perium on you right now...? I honestly didn’t have any expectations, but you came with quite a lot, didn’t you? Let’s see, a bone that you could buy with that much money... here, you can buy one of these two.\"\"...Huh?\"\nThe merchant took out two pieces of bone and placed them on the counter, though he didn’t know where she had taken them out from. Both of them were large, so he couldn’t even guess what part they came from. One of them was slightly dyed red, and the other was dyed blue. When he saw the two bones, Lee Shin Woo couldn’t help but retort.\n\"...The Matrix?\"\"You won’t wake up from a dream just because you choose the red bone. After all, this is reality.\"\"No, wait. Can’t I just buy a lot of bones? I want to acquire as many experiences as possible.\"\"You can only buy 1 bone with the money you have. Our shop doesn’t sell level 1 monster bones. I won’t stop you from buying bones cheaper than these two, but you’ll regret it.\"\nUltimately, it seemed like he had no choice but to pick one of the two bones. If so, he wanted to at least get the most information possible before buying, but she firmly shook her head.\n\"Item information is also karma. Customer, you don’t have enough Perium to get information on these bones, and buy them.\"\"Eeek...\"\nAt this point, this woman didn’t seem like a priestess who helped heroes under God’s orders, but a scammer instead, but it didn’t seem like she’d give him the information on the bones no matter what he did. If both bones cost the same, then their potential should be the same as well... if so...\n\"Of the two, which is more expensive?\"\"The blue one’s a bit more expensive. It costs 3,350 Perium.\"\nHe would only be left with 70[1] Perium once he bought it... It would be irreversible, regardless of his choice. He nodded stiffly.\n\"Please give me that one.\"\"A manly choice. Here you go.\"\nThe Perium disappeared from his inventory, without him needing to pass her the money. When he saw the blue bone replace the money in his inventory, Lee Shin Woo felt somewhat relieved. Then, the merchant clapped her hands.\n\"Now, it’s time to part ways. If you work hard on quests, you’ll probably see me again soon. I’ll tell you one thing, you just made a very good decision, customer. Since the base is important.\"\"The base...?\"\"Then, I’ll see you next time.\"\nShe said grinningly, and though he was incredibly confused, she smiled beautifully and clapped her hands again. At that moment, the space surrounding Lee Shin Woo instantly broke down, and he was returned to the place he was before entering the shop.\n\"...\"\nTo be honest, he was a bit disappointed. These past few days, he hadn’t been able to have a proper conversation with someone else. Regardless of how similar she looked to that cheeky god, just the fact that he was able to have a conversation with her was a huge comfort to him.Only after that thought did Lee Shin Woo realize that he was starved of human contact. \"No... Don’t be negative.\"\nThe only thing that could push Lee Shin Woo forward right now was positivity. If he wasn’t positive, he wouldn’t be able to do anything. He shook his head so much that his neck joint creaked, and then, took the bone out of his inventory.\n\"Bone Reinforcement.\"\n[Would you like to use ???’s bone to reinforce your own bones? You can reinforce your skull.]\nHe had a good feeling about this. It was his first time reinforcing his head, but he felt like it wasn’t a part that he could reinforce very easily.\n\"Alright, reinforce.\"\nHe proceeded with the reinforcement without hesitation, and then, the blue bone in his hand disappeared without a trace; simultaneously, he felt a dull shock to his head.\n\"Ugh...\"\n[You have reinforced your skull. Magic has increased by 7. You have gained a portion of ???’s memories and experiences.][I can’t understand you people. This research will lead us to ruin. - ???]\nWhen a portion of the memories of the original owner of the bone flowed into his head, he understood the ’base’ that the merchant had told him about. He didn’t know about Earth, but it was the ability to wield the energy that was at the base of all existence in this world.\n[You have gained the passive skill, Beginner Magic Affinity Lv1. Magic recovery rate increases.]\nAfter Lee Shin Woo had barely overcome the migraine, he blankly raised his head and looked at the world. He had thought there was only death in this world, but there was something that remained that still harbored life.It was mana.\n[1] T/N: Author writes 90 Perium, but that’s not correct based on what he wrote earlier.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 3 part1",
    "content": "<Chapter 3. Level Up - 1>\n\"It’s a good view.\"\nLee Shin Woo carelessly muttered. Although he was underground, mana was everywhere, and harmoniously floated about. Lee Shin Woo stretched his bare hand, and the mana briefly remained at his fingertips, and then went somewhere else. It seemed it was because his Beginner Magic Affinity was still only level 1.\n’Getting this skill early on was definitely a good call.’\nHe stayed there, playing with the mana a bit more, and then, withdrew his hand and nodded his head. After experiencing the mystery of mana, he finally felt like he was in a different world. He had felt, how should he say it, that it was just a survival game up until now.\n’If the blue bone was this effective, then what would the red bone do? It feels like the red bone would’ve been really helpful. I can’t ignore Perium anymore... oh.’\n[A quest has occurred!]\nHe wasn’t that surprised this time seeing the quest message. Before the message appeared, he saw the mana in front of him distort, and not only that, he had predicted that it would appear at around this timing.\n[The Ability to Survive Here]\n[Though you have safely infiltrated the Empire, you are still too weak. The Underground Empire is vast, and there are powerful undead who have lived a long time within. However, there are fortunately some who evaded the undead curse and continued to live. These living beings inhabit an isolated environment, the dungeon.]\n[You must first build up your strength in the dungeon before you start your battle with the undead in earnest. Pick a dungeon nearby and get to level 2. When the sum of your stats reaches 200, the karma that you’ve gathered up to that point will determine your future appearance and potential.]\n[However, be cautious. The dungeon itself is safe from the curse, but those who were cursed and entered into the dungeon are not.]\n[Quest reward - Open Heroes’ Chatting Channel]\n\"What!?\"\nAfter he read the entire quest, Lee Shin Woo’s eyes glared. A chatting channel? It would’ve been nice if they’d opened the chatting channel earlier!\nIf not, is this karma too!? If that’s also not it, is getting to level 2 the prerequisite to entering the chatting room!?\n\"Let’s go now. Right now.\"\n[The dungeon’s location is being shown on the minimap.]\nHowever, contrary to his massive complaining, he immediately nodded his head and accepted the quest. He had been lonely since he hadn’t had anyone to talk to, but a channel where he could talk to the other heroes inside the Empire? He would be lying if he said he wasn’t happy.\nFurthermore, realistically speaking, this chatting channel would be helpful. The heroes agreed that their mission was to save the Empire. Then that meant they were on the same page. Lee Shin Woo hoped that the heroes deep within the Empire would each say a word or two to their junior.\n’No wait, I might be thinking too optimistically since I’ve been starved of human contact, but... in any case, I’ll know when the channel’s open.’\nAs long as he behaved himself, Lee Shin Woo would be able to use this chatting channel effectively. He was extremely satisfied with the quest reward, nodded his head, and finally noticed the last phrase of the quest.\n[However, be cautious. The dungeon itself is safe from the curse, but those who were cursed and entered into the dungeon are not.]\nHe tilted his head. The monsters inside the dungeon aren’t affected by the curse, but the heroes who had entered the empire have already been affected by it, so be cautious if you don’t want to die, is that it? He was an undead that was blessed with immortality, so he didn’t really worry about it too much.\n’...Alright, let’s find a suitable dungeon nearby.’\nLee Shin Woo leaned against a nearby building’s wall and concealed himself; then, he gently closed his eyes and saw the minimap.\nThings like the monsters’ locations didn’t appear on the minimap, but aside from that, it showed the surrounding area in fair detail. Lee Shin Woo tended to not have a good sense of direction, so showing the surrounding area would give him a solid sense of direction.\n’There are three shining points above the minimap... Their size is subtly different; does the difficulty correspond with the size?’\nThere were three dungeons in the immediate vicinity. Right now, he couldn’t tell what kind of monsters were in a certain dungeon, nor could he tell their difficulty level. He wouldn’t know until he personally entered the dungeon.\nIf that’s the case, picking any of them should be fine. Lee Shin Woo started to walk towards the closest dungeon. First, he needed to get out of the ruined city; then he would need to go past the desert terrain, which was all he saw, to reach his destination.\n’The surrounding area should be safe. Since those skeletons just stayed atop the castle wall.’\nOf course, he couldn’t afford to be careless. After all, a Treasure Eater had appeared in the external passageways, which could be considered the tutorial stage, just because a Lv2 item had appeared.\nLee Shin Woo still wasn’t confident that he could beat a Treasure Eater one on one with ease. The wall called ’levels’ was huge and sturdy. However, it would change soon. As long as he raised his stats by 9, that is.\n’First, let’s be cautious of our surroundings...’\nHe had been afraid of the Empire ever since he saw the quest alert window, and he had comparatively been recklessly charging forward until now. Even so, Lee Shin Woo had no choice but to be on his guard. He couldn’t afford to be reckless, even when taking on level 1 skeletons as his opponents.\nHowever, fortunately, his concerns were unfounded. He hadn’t encountered a single zombie or skeleton before reaching the dungeon that hid on the outskirts of the ruined city.\n’...It’s strange though.’\nSince he hadn’t encountered anything, he was even more concerned. How could there be fewer skeletons within the Empire than the skeletons guarding the external passageways? To him, who had prepared for a much more dangerous fight with the Treasure Eater, he felt all his energy drain away.\n’Perhaps it’s a matter related to the dungeon.’\nHe didn’t ignore this sense of disharmony. He returned his bow that he had taken out to intercept enemies from a far distance and tightly gripping the bone spear. Then, he cautiously moved forward, being watchful of his surroundings.\nHis level 4 Beginner Spearmanship would be better than his level 2 Beginner Archery against a strong opponent. More importantly, his bone spear was at level 2. He felt more reassured when he held the spear than the bow.\nHe recollected his faint experience in the army, and instinctively guarded in all directions poorly, and after a while of walking tactically, he finally arrived at the point that shimmered on his minimap.\nThe problem was that it kept shining.\n’I arrived but... So where exactly is the dungeon? Do I have to dig into the ground or something?’\nThe dungeon entrance was so well hidden that if the dungeon’s location hadn’t appeared on the minimap, Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t have been able to recognize it.\nHe couldn’t find it by looking at the ground, and it was a structure where he would find the stairway that led underground only after digging for quite a while, but honestly, there was a secret that was hidden here. And before he went through the effort of digging, Lee Shin Woo, fortunately, realized that.\n\"What’s this pattern?\"\nThere was a pattern on the ground that faintly emitted light. Lee Shin Woo scrutinized it for a while and realized that the pattern didn’t actually exist but was a trace of mana that had become fixed, albeit faintly.\n’This does look like the dungeon’s entrance. What do I have to do for the mana to, oooh.’\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo’s bare bone came into contact with the trace of mana, the magic circle that blocked the dungeon’s entrance responded to Lee Shin Woo and started to strongly surge up. Lee Shin Woo instinctually directed the mana that was gathered in his bone and touched it.\nThen, it seemed as though a light more powerful than the pattern was emitted, and Lee Shin Woo absorbed it! At the same time, Lee Shin Woo saw a series of texts in front of him, like when he saw his status or quests.\n[Level 1 dungeon - You have received a permit to enter the Rural Rat Nest. All of your stats increase by ten in the dungeon. Info on the dungeon is added to your minimap. All your actions in the dungeon are buffed.]\n[Beginner Magic Affinity has become Lv2. Magic recovery rate increases.]\nThe pattern on the floor naturally shut off, and the stairway that led underground appeared. If he hadn’t learned Beginner Magic Affinity, he probably would’ve had to dig into the ground until he found the stairs. He also wouldn’t have known that the dungeon was level 1, that his stats would be increased in the dungeon, or that he’d be buffed inside the dungeon.\nLee Shin Woo suddenly self-praised his choice (though it was more like a gamble than a choice) and went down the stairs into the dungeon.\n- Kwang\nThe surroundings gradually got darker, and while going down the top of the stairway, suddenly the ceiling made a sound as it closed, and pieces of rock fell down in a flurry. If he were still human, he would’ve said it was dirty and freaked out, but after becoming a skeleton, he didn’t need to wash up. It was fine as long as he didn’t take a lot of damage.\n’I don’t need to eat, don’t need to bathe, and I don’t even need to sleep. I might even have the greatest advantage in roaming around this undead nest.’\nJust considering the fact that he was thinking so strategically about his undead situation meant that his thought process was already far different than when he was still human, but he wasn’t self-aware of this. He was just curious when this stairway would end and busily moved his feet.\nBut in the midst of that, his tension and his wariness helped to keep him from foolishly losing his life.\n[Keuhat!]\n\"Ugh!?\"\nThe incident happened in a split second. Finally, at the end of the ladder, he saw a stone floor exposed underneath, and while he was going down the ladder two steps at a time due to his excitement, suddenly, a bright light attacked him from within the darkness.\nIt was extremely fast and at the same time, powerful. Lee Shin Woo instinctually used Sprint and tried avoiding it, but despite that, the elbow of his arm not holding the spear starting from the bottom was completely severed.\n\"Ggeuuuuhk...!\"\nEven though he had changed into an undead, he retained his sense of pain. The pain he received was naturally awfully huge.\nStill, Lee Shin Woo suppressed his desire to roll on the floor and raised his spear. He couldn’t even tell where his opponent was, so getting angry at his injury was just a luxury right now!\n’I was careless. I thought that the dungeon entrance would be ok.’\nNo, that wasn’t it. He had put up his guard. His opponent was just too fast, and he just couldn’t evade it.\nEven right now!\n’Ugh!’\n[Keuhaak!]\nBy the time he had seen a glimmering light in the darkness, it was already too late. Lee Shin Woo hunched down without thinking the instant he felt goosebumps on his entire body. Something passed over his head, possessing both destructive force and speed.\n[Beginner Sprint has become Lv5.]\n\"Shit!\"\nAfter he had barely dodged his enemy’s attack, he grit his teeth and stabbed his spear forward. Until now, he had always thrust with the strength of both arms, but now, since he was gripping it with one arm, the force behind it wasn’t like it was before.\n[Kuwaak!] Google seaʀᴄh noᴠelfire.net\n\"Ugh, damn it...!\"\nHis enemy couldn’t dodge his quick counterattack and his spear did indeed pierce its flesh, but he could tell that it wasn’t a fatal blow from the blunt feeling that was relayed from the spear. He withdrew his spear, desperately retreated back and grit his teeth.\n[Kuhaaaak!]\n\"Why you...!\"\nIt was at that moment. He didn’t know where exactly his enemy was, but after it yelled out a strange sound, the torches on the walls that no one knew about were lit in order and the whole area was slightly illuminated. Lee Shin Woo was finally able to see what his opponent looked like.\n[Geu...Geuuaaaah...!]\nIt had rotting, decaying clothes, and similarly dressed down and dirty. There were cracks here and there on its body, and contrastingly, it wielded a long sword that gleamed silver... That was definitely a zombie.\n’An undead...?’\nLee Shin Woo didn’t think an undead would appear, yet one had appeared at the starting entrance. He didn’t know what to think and momentarily stiffened. That was his mistake.\n[Guaaah!]\nHis opponent’s rotten eyeballs rolled, and it advanced towards him, swinging its sword. Lee Shin Woo instantly lost his head. It was an absurdly nimble and sharp strike.\n’You bastard...!’\nLee Shin Woo had been reduced to a head and rolled through the air. As he did so, the damn zombie that had killed him didn’t stop looking at him until the end.\nHe had vowed to never die again, and it felt unfair that he had lost one of his lives so futilely. They said that undead wouldn’t appear in this dungeon, but the fact that an undead had suddenly appeared from the start pissed him off.\nAt that time.\n[Invisible Heart has become Lv3. All stats increase by 3.]\n[97 levels remaining until the max level.]\nAt the same time as he saw the message, he was familiar with it since he had seen it once...\n[Your total stat count is above 200. Would you like to receive level 2’s karma? It is also possible to put it off briefly.]\n[You have encountered an Undead Hero (Lv2). If you succeed in giving the Undead Hero peace, you will inherit the opponent’s Perium that he gathered until his death, as well as a permit for God’s secret shop.]\nHis eyes were filled with the appearances of strange messages.",

    "content": "<Chapter 3. Level Up - 2>\n’An Undead Hero... Damn it, that’s what it was talking about.’\nOnly after reading the message did Lee Shin Woo barely understand the meaning behind the message when the quest occurred.\nThe message, ’The dungeon itself is safe from the curse, but those who were cursed and entered the dungeon are not.’ wasn’t talking about Lee Shin Woo, but of those who may have gone into the dungeon before him and had become undead!\n’It’s level two and it’s a hero too. So, if the other heroes die, they really are mercilessly turned into the undead.’\nRight now, he wasn’t even concerned about the reward for taking down the undead hero. That’s because he was instead thinking of how much Perium it had gathered before dying, and what he could buy with that money in the secret shop.\nBut if there was something that concerned him, it was that the effect of Invisible Heart had increased all his stats by three, and his total stats broke through the 200 mark; he wondered whether he should accept the level up or not.\n’... I’m strangely torn.’\nCommon sense dictated that he should immediately nod his head and level up. Though the enemy who lopped off his head was a zombie, it was still a level 2 hero, and if he wanted to kill it easily, he should also be at level 2.\nHowever, there was something that bothered him; it was the message stating that he could briefly postpone his decision.\nWhy? Why would they need to ask that now? If he was only allowed one choice, telling him that he shouldn’t proceed with that choice had absolutely no meaning!\n’If that’s not the case, then... do you perhaps get something for postponing your level up?’\nLee Shin Woo violently rolled his head as he saw the zombie hero confirm his death, return his sword, and turn around. What could be the reason for postponing a level up? And what would change as a result?\n[Keuhak... Keuhahat.]\nWhile he pondered this, the zombie hero hobbled away, slowly returning back to where it came from.\nWhen he looked at the zombie hero’s body, he noticed that it was badly damaged. Its entire body had slash marks, as well as traces of bite marks; its neck was especially damaged, as more than half had been cut off and the neck bone was struggling to keep the shoulder and neck together.\n’...Then...’\nWhen he saw the wound, Lee Shin Woo was sure. He would postpone his level up to 2 and knew what he had to do, what he could do.\nNo, he didn’t need any more excuses. That’s just what he wanted to do right now. It was a desperate revenge.\n[Your advancement to level 2 is briefly on hold.]\n[Your body is reviving.]\nFor now, he steeled himself and quickly proceeded with his resurrection. Even his once lost arm was completely restored, and Lee Shin Woo lightly retrieved the Bone Spear that was rolling on the floor; and he silently, extremely silently stood up.\nThe zombie didn’t think that the skeleton it had just taken down had a resurrection skill, so it kept walking slowly.\n’Heup... Die!’\nLee Shin Woo only properly aimed for the zombie’s neck, and forcefully took a step forward, simultaneously gripping his spear and strongly pierced forward. His stats were buffed by the dungeon, so his spear contained a force that he hadn’t had just yesterday!\n[Critical Hit!]\n[You have learned the passive skill, Beginner Critical Hit Lv1! It will become easier to ascertain your opponent’s weak points, and you can land a fatal blow.]\n[Kyaaaaaaaahk!]\nIts sharp scream screeched like a drill, and echoed throughout the clearing. His attack had definitely hit the mark, and he had succeeded in shattering more than half of the zombie’s neck bone. As expected, he had a chance, even at level 1!\nPlus, his attack just now had caused him to learn the Critical Hit skill, so it was like killing two birds with one stone.\n[Kik, Kihaaaaahk!]\n\"How dare you! Kyaaaaahk!\"\nThe zombie hero was extremely agitated, turned around, and attempted to slash him with its sword, but Lee Shin Woo pulled the spear lodged in its neck with all his might and cried out a shriek that wouldn’t lose to the zombie’s. He had used his sole skill that utilized mana, the Shriek of the Dead!\n[By using the Shriek of the Dead, the enemies in the entire area have momentarily fallen into a frenzied state.]\n[Shriek of the Dead has become Lv2.]\nThe instant it heard his shriek, the trajectory of the zombie’s sword stab greatly shook. Lee Shin Woo used that opportunity to safely pull out his spear and retreat. However, his (nonexistent) eyes were filled with unpleasant messages, compared to when he had swung his spear and slashed the zombie’s neck.\n[The enemy resists the status ailment. It was unable to completely resist the effects, but it has recovered its reduced accuracy rate.]\n[Kuhwaaaak!]\n\"You piece of...!\"\nThe zombie had immediately regained its form and its sword was approaching quickly! Before it was too late, Lee Shin Woo grasped its sword’s trajectory, and raised his spear, using his Beginner Weapon Defense. However...\n- Kwajik (breaking sound)\n\"Huh...?\"\nIts quickly approaching sword had broken his spear into pieces, the bone spear that was level 2 and had been reinforced three times (+3)! Its force truly felt akin to lightning.\nHowever, despite the crazy situation, Lee Shin Woo frantically suppressed his unrest, and stabbed with a part of the split bone spear, shoving it into the zombie’s neck. The zombie screamed and retreated.\n\"You piece of shit...!\"\n[Kuwaaaahk!]\nHe hurriedly picked up the remaining half of the splintered bone spear. However, because of the bone spear lodged in its neck, the zombie was worked up and attacked!\nFortunately, the force behind its sword swing was definitely weaker than before. The damage it had sustained was critical.\n\"Ugh...!\"\nThe moment they clashed, Lee Shin Woo solely trusted in his instincts and used his Sprint skill, throwing his body at the zombie; and the zombie’s sword dangerously grazed the small of his back. A savage breaking sound passed by him, and Lee Shin Woo nimbly uprighted his body, and before the zombie could take a stance, he thrust the remaining bone spear piece in his hand into its neck!\n[Critical Hit!]\n[Ugh.... Kuhaaak, Keueeek...!]\nIt had definitely hit the mark. Moreover, the unstable neck had two thick spears lodged into it, so the zombie couldn’t even move, and merely floundered its hands around. The problem was that the sword within those floundering hands had a destructive power that couldn’t be ignored and that it was cutting through the air.\nNo matter how he thought about it, the zombie’s strength mostly came from its weapon, not its physical abilities. If not, there was no way that it would be able to easily cut through a level 2 weapon as if it were a straw!\n\"Hoo...\"\nSince he knew how frightening the zombie’s sword was, Lee Shin Woo didn’t hastily approach, and instead, stayed back safely, and took out his bow and some arrows from his inventory.\nAlthough his Beginner Archery was only level 2, there was no way he’d miss at this distance. He notched an arrow on the bowstring, carefully aimed for its head, and fired.\n[Gguaaaaahk!]\nIt hit the mark. Of course, even with a headshot, a level 1 weapon wasn’t capable of inflicting a fatal wound. Though the kinetic energy from the arrow unleashed a force that violently shook the zombie’s head, and as a result, it only received an intense shock, rather than damaging its unstable neck.\n\"Here, have some more!\"\nHe shot another, and then one more. Its neck extended and sagged and was accompanied by the sound of flesh tearing. Read full story at novᴇlfire.net\nIts sword, which continuously cut through the air, had momentarily stopped. Despite that, Lee Shin Woo didn’t let down his guard, and once again notched an arrow, pulling the bowstring with all his strength, and... let go.\n[Critical Hit!]\n[The Beginner Critical Hit skill has become Lv2.]\n[Kehk...]\nThe zombie muttered something, and the moment it took a step forward, its neck bone let out a horrifying breaking sound and broke. It couldn’t bear its weight, so the head completely tore off, and rolled onto the floor.\nLee Shin Woo forcefully stepped on its head, which had rolled up to his foot, without hesitation. That was the moment his vengeance was complete, and simultaneously, the moment his level up began.\n[You have defeated a Lv2 Zombie Hero. You have achieved a feat of defeating an enemy with a higher level than you. Agility and Magic permanently increase by 2.]\n[You have acquired a permit to access god’s secret shop. You have acquired 2,280 Perium.]\n[You did not submit to defeat and succeeded in your revenge. Now, it is time for you to receive your karma.]\n[Lv2 Feather Bone Boots (+1), Broken Lv2 Bone Spear (+3), and the Lv2 Zombie Hero’s arm bones are absorbed through Bone Reinforcement.

You have acquired 17% proficiency in Low Rank Bursting Thunder.\n[You have achieved a feat of acquiring a low rank skill. Magic increases by 5.]\n[The Bone Reinforcement skill has become Lv3. The skill effectiveness increases.]\nThe instant his level increased, despite him not activating his Bone Reinforcement, the bones rolling around everywhere gleamed, and disappeared. The energy within the bones was absorbed into him. Even the Feather Bone Boots he was wearing! Fortunately, he was able to receive all the abilities within still intact.\n’Ugh... my head hurts...!’\nAt the same time, memories were engraved in his head, overloading it. The Zombie Hero’s memories had obviously increased his level, and its knowledge of this world instantly flowed into him!\nLee Shin Woo suppressed his desire to lose consciousness by gritting his teeth and organized and accepted the flowing knowledge as calmly as possible. His body made a dreary sound as well, and was changing in real time. However, because he had such a large headache, he didn’t really feel the pain from the evolution of his physical body.\n’Urgh...!’\nHis feeble bones became thicker, and the shape of his bones looked more suited for combat, as well as more durable. Compared to his body, his excessively large skull had reduced in size and became sturdier, while the skeleton which didn’t have any dirt on it became slightly murky.\nMeanwhile, a brand was engraved on his forehead, emitting a faint red light. Right now, Lee Shin Woo thought the word meant avenger, though he had no way of knowing. It was proof that his decision to defer his level up and prioritize taking down the zombie was the correct choice.\n[You have become level 2. The effectiveness of your stats increases. Your inventory increases by 10 boxes.]\n[Due to your achievement, you have gained the ability of an avenger. You have learned the passive skill, Beginner Avenger Lv1.]\nHow much time had passed since that message had appeared? He had frantically organized his brain and while he accumulated the knowledge, as well as the information, his front was filled with messages. For the first time, Lee Shin Woo realized that the pain that afflicted his body and mind had gone away.\n\"Hoo...\"\nHe had gotten a hold of himself, surveyed his surroundings, and then took a sigh of relief. Despite the commotion, no monsters had appeared. Perhaps the Zombie Hero he had fought had killed all the living beings in the dungeon.\n\"Then, where?\"\nToo many things had changed all at once. He needed to more precisely understand the dungeon, if for no other reason than to explore the dungeon. Lee Shin Woo briefly took a deep breath and muttered status.\n[Lee Shin Woo]\n[Skeleton Avenger Blessed by God]\n[Lv - 2(Status effectiveness 110%)]\n[Strength - 73 + 10 Agility - 77 + 10 Health - 61 + 10 Magic - 43 + 10] (While the dungeon bonuses still apply)\n[Passive skills - Invisible Heart Lv3, Acting Lv2, Beginner Avenger Lv1, Low Rank Bursting Thunder Lv1, Beginner Archery Lv2, Beginner Magic Affinity Lv2]\n[Active skills - Bone Reinforcement Lv3, Beginner Sprint Lv7, Beginner Shriek of the Dead Lv2]\nAnd then he suddenly realized that defeating the Treasure Eater or the Zombie Hero had been a miracle.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 3 part3",
    "content": "<Chapter 3. Level Up - 3>\nLee Shin Woo checked his status and couldn’t hide his astonishment at all.\n’It’s not just a simple increase in stats, but it increases the effectiveness of my stats by 10%?’\nSo that’s why there’s such an obvious, overwhelming divide between level 1 and level 2! If this kind of calculation is applied going forward, there’ll be an even larger difference from level 2 to level 3, and level 3 to level 4. His eyes looked dazed just imagining it. He realized that he still had a long way to go. If he had known this information beforehand, he wouldn’t have even thought about fighting the Zombie Hero. The only reason he could even win against it was because the damage to its body had been so severe. He had been extremely lucky.\n[Strength - 73 + 10 Agility - 77 + 10 Health - 61 + 10 Magic - 43 + 10] (While the dungeon bonuses still apply)\nThe power of the level itself was amazing, but his stats, which had absorbed the Bone Spear, the Feather Bone Boots, and the bones that the Zombie Hero had left behind, were also quite impressive. Due to his stat bonus from dying, as well as the effect of his achievement, Bone Reinforcement had resulted in an inflation of his stats.Losing the Lv2 Bone Spear was regrettable, to the point of tears, but it had caused him to grow since it had been broken anyway.\n’Then how about... I have two new skills, huh.’\nWhen he leveled up, he had acquired the skill, ’Avenger’, and a skill from the Zombie Hero’s memory, ’Bursting Thunder’. Because they had such grandiose names, Lee Shin Woo was concerned that they might be all looks and no substance, but it was just an absurd misunderstanding.\n[Beginner Avenger Lv1 (Passive)][Once you harbor a grudge on someone, they cannot escape. You will be buffed if you run from the battlefield, and you can find the opponent who defeated you on the minimap. When you fight that opponent again, all your abilities will increase by 20%. Every time your revenge is successful, the skill grows.]\nHe gained the Avenger skill on the premise that he’ll lose.\nIt was definitely a great skill. However, it seemed like a strange skill that wouldn’t have much opportunity for growth, so he was slightly lost in disappointment, but when Lee Shin Woo understood the meaning behind ’You will be buffed if you run from the battlefield’, he came to his senses.\n’Does it mean that it’s ok to run away for the purpose of revenge? If that’s the case, then dying in battle isn’t the only thing considered a defeat. ...It might not be such a simple skill as I had first thought.’\nTrue, if defeat only came at the hands of a lost battle, then there would obviously be no point to this skill since not everyone has a resurrection skill. The method of using the Avenger skill was different from the other skills he had gained thus far and was caused by the effect of his actions. The potential growth of this skill depended on how he used it. Of course, there was still stuff he didn’t know about the skill, so recognizing that there was potential in the skill was the best he could do for now.\n[Bursting Thunder Lv1(Passive)][A close combat fighting style that was created by a legendary hero; after it was enhanced by God’s power, this skill was born. As the greatest fighting style that includes all close combat techniques and defensive techniques that originate from unarmed combat, its power and speed are akin to exploding lightning and fatal. In order to properly demonstrate that strength, the techniques are naturally clad in magic, but this is not possible at the current level.]\nOn the other hand, contrary to Avenger, Bursting Thunder was an incredibly intuitive ability. For some reason, he was able to naturally understand why Spearmanship, Swordsmanship, even Weapon Defense, and Critical Hit were absorbed in the process of gaining the skill. It was a technique that included all close combat techniques! He didn’t really need to say how amazing it was. It wasn’t a technique that he could gain anywhere. By absorbing the bone that the Zombie Hero left behind, he had extracted the memories and experiences within. If it hadn’t been for Bone Reinforcement...!\n’For a legendary hero’s ability to be enhanced by God’s power. There’s no way that a Lv2 hero could have created it himself, so he likely asked for this skill from God.’\nWhen he thought about it like that, he felt like he’d scored. He’d be able to gain the abilities that God had given to the other heroes because of Bone Reinforcement! He had once again realized that that the Bone Reinforcement skill’s potential was unlimited.More importantly, it was amazing that the Bursting Thunder skill was at the low rank level. This was the first low rank skill he’d obtained, and considering his achievements, he was sure that it was a high-rank skill, rather than low rank.\n’Then, lastly... let’s take a look at the sword the zombie left behind.’\nHonestly, when he defeated the Zombie Hero, he was most excited about acquiring its sword, not the level up, nor the acquisition of skills. Regardless of how experienced it was in Bursting Thunder, splitting a level 2 Bone Spear in a single strike was evidence that its weapon’s ability was uncommon.\n\"It’s over here.\"\nSince the Zombie Hero had already disappeared and was gone, it was easy to find the sword that was rolling on the ground. The sword gleamed in a blue light within the darkness and looked truly mysterious, so his anticipation continued to rise. However, the moment Lee Shin Woo excitedly grabbed the sword, something strange happened. The sword which had definitely been made of metal emitted a cracking sound and started to change!\n[Through the power of Bone Reinforcement, all weapons that you gain change into bone.][Lv4 ’Thunder Lasting’ has changed into Lv3 ’Bone of Thunder Lasting’.]\nThe weapon completely transformed the moment he touched it and it became really short. The bone blade radiated a delicate blue light, and the hilt became discolored, transforming into a black bone...\n’...Bone?’\nNo, he ignored the impossibility of metal transforming into bone for now. How could a level 4 item instantly degrade into a level 3 item? What a waste!He thought everything would be good, but he didn’t know that Bone Reinforcement would have such a fatal flaw. Until now, all the items he had acquired were made of bone, so he hadn’t been aware of it at all!\nLee Shin Woo was momentarily lost in a state of listlessness. If he was holding a level 4 weapon right now, he would’ve felt invincible...!\n’No wait... Damn it, get a hold of yourself. I should’ve expected this kind of demerit.’\nMoreover, it would’ve always been a demerit. Since Bone reinforcement would change all the weapons he acquired, he’d be able to use the weapons he wouldn’t otherwise be able to use.However, if he looked at the long-term, it would definitely be an advantage. He had no choice but to think that way for now. Tears flowed from his eyes (though they really didn’t) and he checked the status of the weapon that changed to bone.\n[Bone of Thunder Lasting][Lv3][Durability: 750/750][Attack Power: 100 - 120][Options: Strength + 5, Agility + 5, Increases Effectiveness of Bursting Thunder + 10%)\n\"Ugh, he probably got this from God, too.\"\nThe abilities of the hero he had just defeated were lousy, whereas the latent potential of the Bursting Thunder skill was ridiculous; not only that, its weapon was also closely related to the skill. In other words, it was likely that the hero, in exchange for being dispatched to this world, asked God to give it a skill and a weapon. When he compared them to the abilities he’d gained, they seemed inferior, and aside from Bursting Thunder, there was a high possibility that the hero had gained other abilities, but he could care less since he didn’t gain those abilities.\n’It’s definitely advantageous to have a high level weapon at the start but... this is the result.’\nThat was the only thing worth complimenting; that the hero had given to his junior. But he’d probably forget about it soon.\nDespite the weapon degrading to level 3, the Bone of Thunder Lasting boasted strength that completely outstripped the Bone Spear. He tried swinging it around, and finally sighed, ridding himself of the regret of not obtaining a level 4 weapon.\nIt was at that moment.\n[Quest complete. The chatting channel is opening.] ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ NoveIꜰire.net\n[Mr. Lee Shin Woo is entering.][Lloyd H.K: Hey, what’s this? A newbie came in?][Seira Von Retadane: Hello, Mr. Lee Shin Woo. It should’ve been a hard decision to become a hero, so thank you for your bravery. Let’s work hard in the future.] [Prince Altania: Anyway, what level are you newbie? 5? 4? You’re not level 3, are you? Please tell me you’re not.][Lloyd H.K: He could start at level 3 and grow. Why are you discouraging someone who just came in?][Prince Altania: Damn it. That’s because if you finish the start at level 3, even if you desperately try to earn Perium, the limit’s level 5. Do you know how many I’ve seen die like that?][Lloyd H.K: But I started at level 3 and now I’m level 6.][Prince Altania: You’re... you’re talented.]\nAs soon as the chatting channel was opened, a few people hectically chattered away. It was called a chatting channel, but it was more like a group chat, so it was noisy hearing so many voices in his ear simultaneously. Despite that, he was so happy that he could hear other people talk that tears threatened to flow. To the point that he somewhat regretted that he didn’t have eyes from which tears could flow.\n[Lee Shin Woo: It’s nice to meet you, seniors. Please take care of me.]\nThe moment the chatting channel opened, he instinctively understood how to use the channel, and gently bent his left pinky finger and spoke. He spoke both reasonably and calmly, to the point where it was difficult to believe that he had become a skeleton. No wait, a skeleton talking was strange from the start.\n[Lloyd H.K: Considering how courteous the newbie is... he’d get along well with Retadane.][Seira Von Retadane: It’s really nice to meet you. You’re still in the outer area, right? If you find something troublesome, please tell me at any time.][Lloyd H.K: See?][Shino Rendu[1]: So what level are you? ...Should I give you some Perium?][Lee Shin Woo: I’m sorry, but why does my level or Perium matter?]\nLee Shin Woo decided to ask what he was most curious about first. He thought that by diligently killing monsters, and stockpiling stats through Bone Reinforcement he would get karma.\nHowever, his senior heroes were synonymous regarding Perium and levels, so he couldn’t help but be curious.\n[Shino Rendu: What? Are you kidding me?][Lloyd H.K: Shino, if he came out of the secret shop only buying equipment, he might not know yet.][Shino Rendu: Ah... is that possible? True, that’s the time when you’re most clueless. Sorry, newbie. I lost a comrade just a little while ago, so I’m a bit touchy.][Lee Shin Woo: That’s alright, I understand, senior. I was shortsighted. It seems that there are items in the secret shop that correspond to level.]\nAs Lee Shin Woo talked through the chatting channel, he felt a strange feeling. His personality was calmer than before, and he spoke respectfully; it felt like he had two personalities. It felt like he was wearing a mask... ah, he was using his Acting skill!\n[Shino Rendu: Fortunately, your brain’s not bad. Yeah, that’s it.][Seira Von Retadane: That’s the significance of the secret shop. You hunt the undead flooding from within the empire, acquire Perium, and then, go to the secret shop to purchase a medicine that increases your stats. Through that, we surpass our limits and are then able to do a more difficult area. At the same time, the purification of the empire progresses. It’s fine, even if your level is a bit low. Since God’s secret shop makes it possible for ’infinite growth potential’.][Lloyd H.K: The higher your level, the more expensive the medicine costs... Do you know how much it costs to buy a single health drug? 300,000 Perium, damn it. It’d probably be faster to achieve a feat and increase my stats that way.][Shino Rendu: But achieving a feat ain’t easy. Alfy wanted to do that and overtaxed himself... Ha.]\nLee Shin Woo was moved once he heard a senior hero lament. He was suddenly sure that his request to God wasn’t wrong.Of course, he knew that they all didn’t have a special characteristic like Bone Reinforcement, but he didn’t know that they had to go through so much trouble just to level up. If they had to go through this much trouble, then it was worthwhile becoming bald and impotent! Probably! Please!\n[Prince Altania: While we’re on the topic, what level are you right now, Retadane?][Seira Von Retadane: Isn’t Mr. Lee Shin Woo more important than me right now?][Prince Altania: You’re avoiding it again. So, newbie, what’s your level?]\nLee Shin Woo was briefly silent. He had just learned new information and suddenly realized how amazing his ability was, so his mind had become busy.However, if he was sure of one thing, it was that he didn’t really need to tell them that he was level 2 and cause them to despair. There was the difference between the level they would accept, and the level he would accept, and in their eyes, his growth rate would seem excessively fast in the future.\n[Lee Shin Woo: I’m level 4.][Lloyd H.K: Nice. If you’re level 4, then there’s still hope in this world.][Seira Von Retadane: That’s a relief. Then it seems like you won’t hopelessly die in the outskirts.][Shino Rendu: Not bad. Hey, after you’ve properly armed yourself, make sure you get the medicine. Increasing your level should be your priority over everything else, your level. You already know, right?]\nSince he knew they would respond like this, he exaggerated quite a lot. He didn’t even know how much he had to raise his stats to get to level 4, but he went with it for now. They had responded in the way he had expected.\n[Prince Altania: Still, you’re not very strong, so you probably received a special feature based on your characteristics. What did you get? You didn’t ask for something like increasing your level, shooting fire, or asking for a sword, right? Please tell me you didn’t.]\nThe abilities one receives when they cross over to Heguroa depends on how strong they were originally. Normally, in a fantasy world, a strong person would comparatively get weaker abilities, while a normal civilian from Earth like Lee Shin Woo would receive the greatest of abilities. That bastard Prince was asking about that right now.\n[Lee Shin Woo: I got a skill.][Prince Altania: Good job! Seriously, good job!][Lloyd H.K: Your base is good. If he does well, he should become strong.][Seira Von Retadane: You did well. None of the skills that God grants are normal. Yes... how can we help Mr. Lee Shin Woo right now?][Lloyd H.K: Newbie, tell us about your current situation. Since we’ll do what we can to help you.]\nFortunately, his seniors seemed mostly amicable. He didn’t know how many of his senior heroes were in the empire, but... he was slightly relieved and replied.\n[Lee Shin Woo: I’m alright for now. If I get into a tough situation, could I please count on your advice then?][Lloyd H.K: Hey, you can speak a bit more comfortably...][Yasunori Akira: Hm, it’s been a while seen we’ve seen a guy with some common sense. If you can safely get to the capital, I’ll put you in my party then.][Lloyd H.K: Akira, you’re still not dead?][Yasunori Akira: You idiot, don’t call me by my name.]\nEven by his standards, he was extremely polite to the point he felt goosebumps! However, Lee Shin Woo was definitely weaker than his seniors right now, so he decided that he needed to thoroughly bow his head for now. Plus, he’s a skeleton right now! There was nothing wrong with always being careful, regardless of who he was dealing with.\n[Prince Altania: Yeah, when the time comes, I’ll give you some advice. Think of it as an honor.][Seira Von Retadane: If you always keep the chatting channel open, you won’t be able to focus on the current situation, Mr. Lee Shin Woo. Please keep that in mind. I’ll be praying for you to safely arrive at the capital.][Lee Shin Woo: Thank you for the advice. Then, I’ll see you later.]\nLee Shin Woo politely said his goodbyes and closed the chatting channel.He could no longer hear the voices that had pounded in his ears, and it felt lonely, but still, he had found a place where he could chatter whenever he wanted, so he was delighted. From now on, he felt sure that he’d be able to cope with this world.\n\"Anyway, since a quest isn’t coming up... it’s telling me to do as I please for now.\"\nIt worked out well. Since he decided to clear the dungeon to adapt to his body, which had advanced to level 2, as well as his new skill, and weapon. Of course, gaining Perium and bones was his highest priority.\n\"Hoo, then... shall we go?\"\nHe sighed satisfyingly and took a step forward into the dungeon. In order to completely adapt to this world, he moved his skeleton body.\n[1] T/N: He’s a man.",

    "content": "<Chapter 4. Hunting Hero - 1>\nHe stared intensely, but there really weren’t any monsters at the entrance, not even one. Lee Shin Woo thought the Zombie Hero, who went into the dungeon before him, had probably cleared all the monsters. But he didn’t know what monsters it had fought for its body to have become such a mess.\n\"Jjik, Jjijik\"\n\"Ah, finally.\"\nHe had been absent-mindedly running through the dungeon, without the appearance of a single monster for 10 minutes, and finally met a monster after he had traversed what he felt was halfway through the dungeon.\nIf you took a common house rat from Earth and made it five times bigger, how disgusting and big would those rats be! Then, he remembered that the dungeon’s name was the rural rat nest.\n\"Jjiiiiiiiiiiiiik!\"\n\"Heup...\"\nFrom the outside, they looked weaker than the Skeleton Soldiers, but he didn’t know what kind of abilities the monsters of this world were hiding! Lee Shin Woo exerted strength into his hand gripping the sword and cautiously took a step forward.\nAt that moment, the Rural Rat exposed its brutally shining front teeth and lunged at him! Lee Shin Woo instinctually took a defensive stance and pointed his blade at his enemy. It was such a solid stance that if a skeleton who knew Weapon Defense saw his form, it would’ve been satisfied with it.\n[You have defeated a Lv1 Rural Rat.]\n[You have received 5 Perium.]\n[You have acquired a Rural Rat’s rib bone.]\n\"...\"\nIt was embarrassing to say that it was a single strike. He had exerted strength into his sword and positioned it so that it would hold back the rat’s charge, but the rat had charged into his sword by itself and died.\nOf course, it was also due to the fact that it was a fine sword, but just by looking at the amount of Perium dropped, he came to an obvious conclusion. The Rural Rat was ridiculously weak, even compared to the Skeleton Soldiers! His tension loosened tiredly, and he felt despondent. Despite that, he instinctually picked up its rib bone and used his Bone Reinforcement.\n[Would you like to use the Rural Rat’s rib bone to strengthen your own bones? You can reinforce your rib bones.]\n\"Reinforce.\"\n[Your rib bones have been reinforced. Absorbing a portion of the Rural Rat’s memories and experiences.]\n[Jjik! Jjijijik, Jjiiiik! - Rural Rat]\nLee Shin Woo momentarily stood there and felt conflicted. What would be the point of exploring this dungeon now...?\nHowever, he soon got a hold of himself and hit his own cheek. An unpleasant sound rang out at the clash of bones.\n\"If I can increase my stats by just one from these guys’ bones, then it would still probably be best that I procure them all. Yeah, now that I’ve made up my mind, I’ll clear out all the dungeons nearby.\"\nIt’d be troublesome if he got arrogant just because he got a little stronger. The fact that he could grow this much despite not knowing magic or how to fight was all because of Bone Reinforcement!\nHe soon decided to calmly and orderly proceed and stepped deeper into the dungeon. It seems that his senior hero hadn’t stepped foot from this point onwards as more and more rats gradually popped out.\nOf course, he cleaned them up in a single strike, but he gradually had to put more force into his sword, so it seemed as though the rats’ health was gradually getting higher.\n[You have reinforced your ribs. Your health has increased by 1. Proficiency in the Beginner Stealth skill has increased by 3%.]\n[The Beginner Stealth skill has become Lv3.]\n[Jjijijijik, jjiiik? - Rural rat]\nWas it because he became level 2? That’s why the level 1 Rural Rat bones would barely increase his stats... However, just like how larvae are good at rolling, the Rural Rat species’ proficiency in the Stealth skill wasn’t bad.\nLee Shin Woo suddenly realized. All monsters have their own worth!\n’I can only lighten my footsteps a little bit for now, but if I develop this skill, it should be really helpful when I need to run away from the battlefield.’\nIn other words, it would be best to use it in tandem with the Avenger skill. By killing the seemingly unimpressive rats, he had gained a skill with such amazing growth potential, so if he turned back after his first rat kill, he would’ve been really disappointed.\n\"Jjijik... Jjiiiiiiik!\"\n\"Yeah, I’m trespassing, so why don’t you try screaming a little louder?\"\n\"Jjiiiiiiik!\"\nRats appeared everywhere and after taking care of them without much difficulty, he greedily absorbed their bones. After walking for a while, Lee Shin Woo realized that the path was getting increasingly narrow. Conversely, there were more and more rats pouring out, and stirring about, making it difficult for him.\n\"Jjiiiik!\"\n\"Jjijijijik!\"\n\"Yes, yes.\"\nHe was well aware of how this dungeon roughly intended to instill the trespasser with terror, but unfortunately, he was able to cut down all the rats that crossed paths with his sword. Lee Shin Woo felt like the path was becoming just a tad bit stuffy.\nMoreover, as he traversed deeper into the dungeon, his body was becoming more accustomed to the Bursting Thunder skill, so he was actually thankful if they changed up the conditions or the environment.\nWith that in mind, he swung his sword, tip facing the ground, upward, and the Bone of Thunder Lasting surged up from the ground to the sky like lightning, brutally slicing through all the rats in the entire area.\n\"Jjiiik! (No!)\"\n\"Jjik!! (It’s in front...!)\"\nThe Rural Rats’ death rattles filled the narrow passage. While he reinforced his bones with theirs, he had finally mastered their language, and he was naturally able to interpret the meaning behind their cries; he only felt a bit uncomfortable.\nTheir desperate behavior only confirmed that there was something deeper within, but he had absolutely no idea what it was. If it was a similar environment to the dungeons he had heard about in FreeNovelFires or manhwa, then there should be a boss within but... For more chapters visıt novel_fіre.net\n’They’re showing way too much loyalty for it to be just a simple boss.’\nThe overly dense population of rats in this area were fully showing their loyalty.\nWhenever he swung his sword, the rats filling the passage would all die by themselves, so around now, it was no longer skill training, but arm swinging training instead.\nUltimately, he had no choice but to unleash a different skill. When it was overflowing with a mob of Rural Rats, he had the perfect ’escape from crisis’ skill to deal with them.\n\"Tsk... Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaahk!\"\n[Using Shriek of the Dead. The enemies in the entire area have fallen into a frenzied state.]\n[The Beginner Shriek of the Dead skill has become Lv3.]\n\"Jjik, Jjijik!?\"\n\"Jjiiiiiiik!\"\nThe effect was astounding! The moment the Rural Rats, who had all rushed at him with the intent to kill, heard the shriek, they were startled, and soon, fought in a fratricidal war! When he saw the dirty blood and flesh splatter everywhere, Lee Shin Woo suddenly trembled.\n’This skill really isn’t good for my mental health. However, if I train it, it might become more amazing than any other skill...’\nHe suddenly realized that Shriek of the Dead was obviously more effective the more enemies it targeted. How many enemies had been targeted for the skill to level up immediately!?\n\"Jjik...\"\n\"Jjijik, Jjik...\"\n\"Well done. Now, rest in peace.\"\nHe waited for the commotion to calm down before he cleaned up the horrific area. After that, he gathered the rib bones without resting and inspected himself while using Bone Reinforcement.\nDespite spending close to a whole day concentrating all his efforts into killing rats and absorbing their bones, his health had only risen by 5; but in its stead, his Beginner Stealth had become level 4. Although he could definitely see himself walking, his movements were light, like the movements of a rat, though it was strange to even himself.\n\"I’ve gotten a bit more familiar with Bursting Thunder, as well as my body and the sword... Good.\"\nSince the skill was so amazing, he felt like he couldn’t even unleash a quarter of the power within Bursting Thunder, but he could roughly imitate the appearance of the technique. For some reason, after swinging his sword in the air a few times, he nodded his head and looked ahead.\nThere was clearly a disparate iron gate located there.\n’I feel mana coming from the gate itself. Since the mana within can’t come out, does it have the ability to imprison whatever’s inside so that it can’t come out?\nHe didn’t have any idea how the dungeon was created, but when he looked at the gate, he thought that perhaps the dungeons were originally set up by God to protect humans from the monsters.\nOf course, now that all the humans who were supposed to be protected by the dungeons had become undead, they probably don’t have much meaning anymore but... He laughed bitterly and placed his hand on the gate. At that moment, a message appeared in front of him.\n[Once you enter the boss room, you cannot exit until either you die, or the boss dies. Will you still enter?]\n\"Yeah.\"\nHe thought that perhaps the secret shop sold an item related to escaping the dungeon, but he thought he didn’t need it right now. He wasn’t being arrogant; this resulted from his extremely calm decision.\n[Lv2 Rural Rat Queen]\n[Lv2 Ratman]\nThe instant he entered the boss room, the first thing he saw were those two entities. Are the bosses normally a level higher than the dungeon? He couldn’t tell yet.\nA rat that was incomparable in size to the normal Rural Rats; the Rat Queen was stuck in a corner of the vast clearing, and the one standing in front of it was... Yeah, the rat standing on two feet was the Ratman. It was a rat commonly called a Were-Rat. Compared to mere Rural Rats, he felt a qualitatively different strength coming from it.\n\"Kihik... Kihiiiiiiik! (You cannot touch the queen!)\"\n\"Kihek, Kihek, Kihek...!\"\nIndeed. It seems like this dungeon was a small kingdom. A kingdom where all the rats serve the queen!\nBy the time Lee Shin Woo had grasped the identity and location of his enemies, his enemies had also started the battle. The Ratman charged at him with surprising speed. At the same time, the Rat Queen began acting aggressively, and that, surprisingly, was ’childbirth’!\n\"Jjjik!\"\n\"Jjijijik!\"\n[Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier]\n[Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier]\n[Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier]\n\"Oh...\"\nWhen Lee Shin Woo saw the just birthed elite monsters following behind the Ratman and lunging at him, he exclaimed at the realization.\nThe Ratman guarded the queen against trespassers, and the queen would birth soldiers in order to help the Ratman drive back their enemy. Honestly, for a level 1 dungeon, they had such an amazing combination that he had no choice but to recognize them. He had expected an incredibly large rat at best.\n\"Heup!\"\nHowever, at best they were enemies that appeared with strength befitting of a boss, but unfortunately, he had fought against the Zombie Hero at the entrance of the dungeon and won, growing to level 2. So now, a Ratman wasn’t a strong opponent for Lee Shin Woo anymore. That’s because no matter how fast it moved, he could read its movements.\n\"Kahahk!?\"\nLee Shin Woo used his Sprint and charged towards the Ratman whose nails were gleaming and was rushing towards him. The Ratman locked onto him and swung its nails, but at that moment, Lee Shin Woo aimed for its chest and stabbed. It was the stab he was most confident in.\n[Critical Hit!]\n\"Kyaaaaahk!\"\n\"Jjik, jjiiiik!\"\nLee Shin Woo, as it were the natural course of action, pierced through the Ratman’s chest. Was that all? He had simultaneously utilized Sprint causing the Ratman to be unable to endure the powerful force, pushing it directly back and causing it to roll to the floor. Its dirty blood scattered about through the air.\nTwo of the Rural Rat Elites that had followed behind the Ratman collided with each other and rolled onto the floor. Lee Shin Woo had the energy to spare and he finished off the remaining, puzzled elite.\n[You have hunted a Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier.]\n[You have acquired 15 Perium.]\n[You have acquired the Rural Rat Elite Soldier’s rib bone.]\nWhen he set aside the Perium amount and looked at them objectively, the Rural Rat Elite Soldiers were stronger than the Skeleton Soldiers. Of course, even so, they would still die in one strike from Lee Shin Woo!\nLee Shin Woo collected its rib bone for now and turned his attention. Even though blood was pouring out of its chest, the Ratman bravely stood its ground. He saw the queen, who was astonished by Lee Shin Woo’s ability, continue to birth rats at an even quicker rate.\n\"Jjik, Jjiiiiik...! (I’ll protect the queen no matter what...!)\"\n\"You left behind such a magnificent line, so you shouldn’t have any more regrets.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s red eyes sparkled and after checking the now standing Ratman’s appearance, he prepared his Sprint skill. If he hadn’t gained the Bone of Thunder Lasting, the fight would have gone longer, but it seemed like he’d be able to end it in one more strike with the strength of his sword.\n\"Jjiik...!\"\nAt that moment, something surprising happened. The Ratman raised both its hands and it seemed as though it was preparing to scratch him, but the next moment, all its nails popped out and flew towards Lee Shin Woo. There were ten in total and considering either the force behind the nails or the mana within them, it certainly wasn’t an ordinary attack!\n\"Ugh!?\"\nLee Shin Woo didn’t think an original attack method like that existed and hurriedly swung his sword to parry the nails. He couldn’t block a few of them as they lodged into various parts of his body, and though it was painful, he had fortunately blocked it from reaching any vital areas.\nIf he hadn’t learned Bursting Thunder, no, if he didn’t have any experience in learning Weapon Defense before, he would’ve died once from this skill.\n\"Kiiiiiiiiik! (Kill him!)\"\n\"Jjiik!\"\n\"Jjijiik!\"\nDuring the brief instant that he blocked the nails, the Ratman led five Rural Rat Elite Soldiers and pounced on Lee Shin Woo. Though blood was flowing down both the Ratman’s hands, it was staking its life to fulfill its vow, and moving to kill Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Tch... Sprint!\"\nLee Shin Woo also didn’t stay still. He immediately took the nails that limited his movement out, grit his teeth, and used his Sprint, charging towards the front. The Elite Soldiers tried to obstruct his vision by throwing their bodies at him first, but that wouldn’t be able to hinder his movement now.\n[You have hunted a Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier.]\n[You have hunted a Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier.]\n\"Jjik!\"\n\"Jjiik!\"\n\"Kuhwaaaahk!\"\n\"Huaaaahp!\"\nThe sound of the rats’ screams, the Ratman’s shriek, as well as Lee Shin Woo’s battle cry mixed into one. In the corner, the Rat Queen was birthing Elite Soldiers even faster in order to take care of the trespasser.\nHowever, by the time the next batch of births was complete, the situation had already been completely cleaned up.\n\"Kik... Kihi... (My... queen...!)\"\n[You have hunted the Lv2 Ratman.]\n[You have hunted a Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier.]\n[You have hunted a Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier.]\nWith one sword strike, Lee Shin Woo killed the three monsters, including the Ratman, and nimbly swung his sword again, killing the other Elite Soldiers attacking him. The strength was truly like lightning falling from the sky and striking the earth.\n[You have hunted a Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier.]\n[You have hunted a Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier.]\n[You have hunted a Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier.]\n\"Ggiiik...! (How...!)\"\nThe Rat Queen spoke in a disbelieving voice. Lee Shin Woo was still intact and collected the bones and the Perium on the ground in one go.\nHonestly, he wanted to reinforce himself with the Ratman’s finger bone first, but right now, he needed to check something first. It was the ability within the Rural Rat Elite Soldiers’ rib bones.\n\"Bone Reinforcement.\"\n[You have reinforced your rib bones. Your proficiency in Stealth has increased by 5%.]\n[Jjjijijijijijijik! - Rural Rat Elite Soldier]\n\"...So that’s how it is.\"\nThe crack in his ribs from the Ratman’s nail throw was quickly healed. Was that all? His Stealth proficiency had increased by as much as 5%. He had predicted this, but it was much more effective than a normal Rural Rat!\nLee Shin Woo’s eyes, which were gazing at the Rural Rat Queen, gleamed drearily.\n\"I’m curious how long you can keep giving birth now.\"\n\"Jjik, Jjiik...!\"\nThe Rural Rat Queen faced the wicked skeleton and was struck with horror.\nOf course, all she could do was give birth, and just like he wanted, she gave him reinforcement materials... No, she had no choice but to birth Elite Soldiers.",

    "content": "<Chapter 4. Hunting Hero - 2>\n[You have reinforced your rib bones. You have absorbed all the memories and experiences that you can from the Rural Rat.]\n[Jjiiiii! - Rural Rat Elite Soldier]\n\"...\"\n\"Jjii...\"\nLee Shin Woo wordlessly checked the message and turned his gaze away. There he saw the face of the dying Rural Rat Queen. It seems that she had a limit to her birthing, and no matter how much she tried, there wouldn’t be any more Elite Soldier births.\n\"What great timing.\"\nHe couldn’t be sure since he didn’t have a watch, but he had killed the Elite Soldiers that she had birthed and Reinforced himself with the bones they left behind; he had already done this several dozens of times or more, and it felt like he had stayed here long enough. In the end, he had completely mastered the rat bones!\nIt was a task that caused him to recollect his time playing an RPG; he left his character in a suitable hunting ground and used his macros to farm.\n\"Jjik, Jjii...\"\n\"Yeah, you’ve done well. I hope you’re reborn as a rat that Cinderella takes care of.\"\nLee Shin Woo spoke tenderly and swung his sword, cleanly decapitating the queen. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo heard the sound of a trumpet ringing in his ear and his eyes were filled with messages.\n[Level 1 dungeon, Rural Rat Nest, clear. Magic has increased by 1.]\n[You have gruesomely slaughtered all life within the dungeon. You have gained 1 Slaughterer’s token.]\n[You have gained the dungeon clear reward.]\nThe queen only left behind a large bone and some Perium, and soon after withered away and disappeared. However, when Lee Shin Woo was picking up the bone and the Perium, he found a wooden box where the queen had disappeared.\nIt was a small and frail box that seemed like it would rot away immediately. It was definitely the dungeon clear reward.\n\"Hoo, now let’s see.\"\nLee Shin Woo opened the box. There was a book and a money pouch containing Perium inside. Lastly, there was also a dagger inside, but it didn’t transform despite him touching it, so when he looked at it again, it was, fortunately, a weapon made of bone!\n[You have acquired the Lv2 Bleeding Tooth.]\n[Bleeding Tooth]\n[Lv2] This update ıs available on NoveI[F]ire.net\n[Durability: 450/450]\n[Attack Power: 18 - 36]\n[Options: When you attack, there is a fixed chance that it will inflict the ’Diseased’ status ailment.]\n\"Strictly speaking, this isn’t a bone... Well, whatever. There are teeth on a skeleton too, so it’s probably something like that.\"\nWhether teeth were bones or not from a medical perspective, the important thing was that it hadn’t transformed and hadn’t lowered in level. There are probably authors who insist that the tooth should’ve changed since it’s not technically bone, but he was willing to assassinate them all.\n[You have acquired 1,500 Perium.]\n[You have acquired the Beginner Stealth skill book.]\n\"It was Stealth!?\"\nHe was, of course, familiar with and expected that it’d be a skill book. He had been secretly, really excited since he thought it’d be a new skill that would increase his overall fighting ability, but... to think it’d be Stealth, something that he’d trained to death in this dungeon!\nHis teeth trembled, and he stored the book. He was already familiar with the skill, so he felt like familiarizing himself with the skill wouldn’t do anything and planned to sell it at the secret shop.\n\"When I put it all together, the dungeon reward isn’t anything special. It’s probably cause it’s a level 1 dungeon... Tch.\"\nHe wouldn’t be able to appease himself without complaining. Lee Shin Woo sighed and checked the items remaining in his hands. They were none other than the Ratman’s, as well as the Rat Queen’s bones.\n\"Now that it’s come to this, you’re my only hope... Bone Reinforcement.\"\n[You have sacrificed the Ratman’s finger bone to strengthen your own bones. Agility and Magic have increased by 1. Absorbing a portion of the Ratman’s experiences and memories.]\n[Ggiiiiiik! Ggihik, Ggiiiiik! (The pain of losing a part of my body is nothing compared to the pain of losing the Queen!) - Ratman]\nYou asshole, even your dying will is way too cool! Moreover, he was able to roughly figure out what skill he would gain from this bone by automatically interpreting this guy’s lines.\nLee Shin Woo sported an insufferable expression and checked his hand. Hmm, as expected, there weren’t any nails. Teeth are acknowledged as bones, so why aren’t nails...?\n\"This is gonna be a skill in name only...\"\nHis agility and magic, which became harder to increase after becoming level 2, had increased by 1 each, so he shouldn’t feel disappointed, but... still, he couldn’t help but be disappointed.\nHowever, he gripped the Rat Queen’s bone, hoping that it would give him a better skill, but ended up with a ridiculous result.\n[You have sacrificed the Rural Rat Queen’s pelvic bone to reinforce your pelvis. Health has increased by 1, and Magic by 2. Absorbing a portion of the Rural Rat Queen’s memories and experiences.]\n[Ggii, Ggiiiiii! (Ah, ah, my adorable children!) - Rural Rat Queen]\n\"...\"\nWhy did it have to be the pelvic bone...? No, it’s probably not. ... It isn’t, right? As the feeling of nausea shot up, he wasn’t able to control his queasiness, but Lee Shin Woo tried really hard not to think about it anymore.\nThen, a message appeared at an opportune time.\n[The dungeon will soon collapse. Please escape before it’s too late.]\n\"So, it’s done its job, then it disappears, huh. ...Good.\"\nHe briefly took a deep breath and turned around. He could already feel the dungeon starting to vibrate slightly. Lee Shin Woo wanted to check the Slaughterer’s token too, but it seemed like he’d have to do that once he got out of the dungeon.\nLee Shin Woo took another deep breath, used his Sprint, and started running. Small fragments of rock were falling from behind him, as well as emitting ominous sounds.\n[Lee Shin Woo]\n[Skeleton Avenger Blessed by God]\n[Lv - 2]\n[Strength - 73 Agility - 78 Health - 82 Magic - 47]\n[Passive skills - Invisible Heart Lv3, Acting Lv2, Beginner Avenger Lv1, Low Rank Bursting Thunder Lv1, Beginner Archery Lv2, Beginner Magic Affinity Lv2, Beginner Stealth Lv7]\n[Active skills - Bone Reinforcement Lv3, Beginner Sprint Lv7, Beginner Shriek of the Dead Lv3]\n\"Nice.\"\nThe first thing he did once he got out of the dungeon was check his status, and those stats made him incredibly pleased. Just before entering the dungeon, his stats hadn’t even reached 200; although his Invisible Heart had activated once, his stats had risen to a sum of 280.\nHe didn’t know how much his stats needed to be to get to level 3, but he was sure he’d be able to reach it soon.\n’Moreover, my low health has completely overtaken my strength and agility.’\nThe Rat Queen, which had appeared as the dungeon boss, had played a huge role in that. Because it had birthed several hundreds of Elite Soldiers, he was able to raise his stats a lot, even though they were all level 1. He was also able to raise his Stealth to level 7.\n’Now my bones shouldn’t break, even if they’re hit fairly hard.’\nHis increase in health through his level up had certainly thickened his bones, as well as made them sturdier; when he tapped his bones, Lee Shin Woo laughed satisfyingly. Then, right on time, the dungeon he had escaped from completely collapsed and a message appeared.\n[A quest has occurred!]\n[The callousness and the cruelty you showed in the dungeon has awakened the karma of a slaughterer. However, you are still too weak, and your enemies were even weaker; ultimately, you did not receive the whole karma, but just a token of it. If you are truly confident that you can bear the weight of the karma, then gather 10 Slaughterer’s tokens, and complete the karma. You should already be well aware of the method.]\n[Quest reward - 1 permit to the god’s secret shop, and 1 exclusive equipment.]\n\"Now that I think about it...\"\nHe thought it would be a quest like ’You’ve gone through a dungeon, so go deeper into the Empire now and annihilate the undead!’, but instead, he got a quest that completely broke his expectations.\nIt reminded him of an item he had forgotten about and pointed him in a direction where he could grow, so it was as if God was personally telling him ’you’re still too weak to get a proper mission, so get as strong as possible’ through a quest.\n’How could it be 10? I don’t have to go through 10 dungeons, do I?’\nThere’s no way he’d have to go through that many. Still, it would definitely be a long journey. Lee Shin Woo wondered whether or not he’d be able to gain a new quest while progressing through this one and became a bit uneasy, but he had no choice but to get a move on for now.\n[Slaughterer’s Token]\n[A fragment of a Slaughterer’s karma. Once you gather 10 tokens, the karma will become whole. It only has meaning when you gather them with your own strength. Since you have gained your first fragment, it becomes easier for you to gain the same token of karma in similar situations.]\n’So, the tokens do have meaning after all. Does it mean that it becomes easier to get the rest since I’ve already gotten one?’\nLee Shin Woo was definitely concerned about the hard to understand and complex factors, so he decided to not think about it too hard.\nHe had even thought about asking his seniors in the chatting channel, but if this was a rare case, it may inversely cause them to pay more attention to him, so he decided not to. Even he thought the Slaughterer’s karma wasn’t normal.\n’Then, shall we get going?’\nFirstly, his goal was to acquire the 10 Slaughterer’s tokens before he became level 3. Lee Shin Woo inwardly set his goal and quickened his steps. He tightly gripped the level 3 weapon in his hand, the Bone of Thunder Lasting.\n[Lv2 Treasure Eater]\n[Lv2 Treasure Eater]\nThat’s right. This treasure drew monsters that he was already familiar with.\nTwo, at that!\n[Guooooooooooooooh!]\n[Kuaoooooooooh!]\n\"No wait, all these guys live nearby?\"\nHonestly, these Treasure Eaters (Lee Shin Woo had encountered a Treasure Eater for the first time in the external passageways), had gathered and targeted his senior hero (they were enemies that would be relatively difficult to face for the other heroes), who had entered the empire with the then level 4 version of the Bone of Thunder Lasting.\nHis senior hero had probably been injured and exhausted from fighting so many of them, so he had run away into the dungeon and had died, but Lee Shin Woo obviously didn’t know the story up to that point.\nThere was only one thing important to him right now: because of his senior’s efforts, the Treasure Eaters had all gathered in this area. Not to mention, they had lost the level 4 item in the past and were really pissed!\n[Gguaaaaaaaaah!]\n[The Treasure Eater used the Shriek of the Dead, but it was nullified by the Invisible Heart.]\nIt must’ve really wanted his treasure, as one of the Treasure Eaters immediately used its Shriek of the Dead as soon as it saw him.\nThe shriek rang out far and wide and resulted in something Lee Shin Woo hadn’t expected; a gathering of the undead. And that was good news for him right now.\n[Patrolling... Discovered monsters... Skeleton... engaging...]\n[A newbie...?]\nThe newbie enthusiast skeletons gathered one or two at a time. There were skeletons he was familiar with, like the Skeleton Soldiers or the Skeleton Archers, but surprisingly, there was also a huge skeleton with a large bone sword amongst them.\n[Lv2 Skeleton Warrior]\nIt was the first skeleton he had seen since coming into the empire that was level 2, the Skeleton Warrior! If he fought it one on one, Lee Shin Woo would always come out on top, but he wasn’t sure he could take on a group of them since he wasn’t sure about their level of strength yet.\n\"Paul, it’s good to see you! Hurry and help me!\"\n[It’s also... good to see you...]\nHowever, he was just glad that that strength was on his side right now! Especially since it was just as brainless as a Skeleton Soldier!\n[Helping... the newbie...!]\n[Requesting... reinforcements. There are a lot... of monsters...!]\nWeak Pauls and strong Pauls came from various places. However, that gradually made it more hectic, and more Treasure Eaters appeared, as they caught a whiff of it. The situation had fallen into utter chaos.\nAnd Lee Shin Woo froze when he coincidentally identified one of the newly arrived Treasure Eaters.\n[Lv3 Treasure Eater]\n\"That’s crazy, a level 3 monster...? And it’s a Treasure Eater at that, so it’s much stronger than normal enemies!\"\nHe was sure. Considering how the level 2 Treasure Eater had been vastly superior in strength to the level 2 Ratman, who had appeared as a dungeon boss, the Treasure Eaters were definitely elite monsters!\n[Kuwoooooooooooh!]\n[The Treasure Eater used the Shriek of the Dead, but it was nullified by the Invisible Heart.]\nHowever, to think that the first level 3 monster he sees would be a Treasure Eater... It seemed as though Lee Shin Woo had a strong relationship with that monster species.\nIf another hero had heard that, they would think of him as a walking lottery ticket. Since the Treasure Eater was truthfully an elite monster, and it was harder to encounter one than taking one down.\n’I might use the Avenger skill for the first time here...’\nEven while Lee Shin Woo wracked his brain for a way to get the most benefit out of this situation, he raised his sword in one hand and bravely yelled out.\n\"We’re going with the siege destruction formation; use the siege destruction formation! Move faster, Pauls!\"\nA fierce battle began between the skeletons, led by a swindling skeleton, and the Treasure Eaters. It was a battle that the one in the external passageway couldn’t be compared to!",

    "content": "<Chapter 4. Hunting Hero - 3>\nOne way or another, the battle had gone on for 20 minutes, and Lee Shin Woo cleanly decided against using his Avenger skill against the Treasure Eaters. While the Pauls were fighting against the Treasure Eaters, he used his Beginner Stealth and tried to covertly escape the battlefield, but it was impossible to escape their sight, especially when their goal was his Bone of Thunder Lasting.\n’Still, I can’t use my weapon as bait to run away. Ultimately, I have to clean up all of them here before I can proceed...’\nLee Shin Woo sighed and raised his head. He saw four Treasure Eaters that only watched him and followed him. There was no point to a beautiful girl chasing after him right now, let alone a caterpillar...\n’How exactly am I supposed to take care of all of these?’\nTruthfully, as the Pauls’ bones fluttered in the wind, they were busy acting violently, and somehow managed to take down two of the Treasure Eaters. It wasn’t hard to land a fatal blow if their swords boasted a high attack power.The problem was that he didn’t have the opportunity to collect their bodies as the other Treasure Eaters ran amuck, eating their comrade’s body and treasure whole. Even though they were the same species, their avarice didn’t lessen one bit. Moreover, it seems as though they became stronger when they ate their comrades’ bodies, so it was truly nuts.\n[Kuwoooooooooh!][The Treasure Eater used the Shriek of the Dead, but it was nullified by the Invisible Heart.][Beginner Shriek of the Dead has become Lv5.]\nDue to the Lv3 Treasure Eater’s Shriek of the Dead, Lee Shin Woo’s own Shriek of the Dead grew. He realized for the first time today that even if he didn’t use the skill personally, it would increase his proficiency, as long as he was exposed to the skill.\n[Ugh... Traitors of... the Empire...!][I’ll get my revenge for... General Seagald here...!]\nBut whenever the Treasure Eaters shrieked, more than half of the skeletons he had gathered fought amongst each other; the fact that the numbers dwindled genuinely made his bones hurt. No, now that he thought about it, they knew about General Seagald! Exactly how popular could he have been!?\n\"You idiots, get a hold of yourselves! You’re comrades!\"[Over there, too... An enemy...!][He’s holding... a nice sword...!][Execute him... and report...!]\"Ah, shit.\"\nHe wondered why his genuine scream hadn’t caused the skeletons to get a hold of themselves. Rather, he had been targeted by the skeletons who were out of their minds due to the Shriek of the Dead. This is why they say kids are ruining comics these days!\n\"Sseup...\" It wasn’t the time to leisurely take on skeletons right now. Though they had killed two Treasure Eaters, there were four remaining, and there was even a level 3 Treasure Eater amongst them.Fine, since it’s come to this, it’s time to counterattack! Lee Shin Woo got atop the roof of a building that had been destroyed by the Treasure Eaters’ rampage and shrieked.\n\"Kuaaaaaaaaah!\"\n[You used the Shriek of the Dead! The enemies in the entire area have momentarily fallen into a frenzied state!][The Lv3 Treasure Eater has resisted the Shriek of the Dead.]\nAt that moment, the atmosphere of the entire area felt like it had calmed down the few skeletons that had been attacking him, as well as the huge caterpillar shaped monsters crazily crawling towards him... The Treasure Eaters even stopped as if they had been stunned.\n\"...Hmm?\"\nAt that moment, Lee Shin Woo thought that it was impossible, but that impossibility had taken hold of those people, no those monsters. The Treasure Eaters started to fight amongst themselves!If they weren’t cognizant that they were allies anymore; the prey they were most hungry for were obviously members of their own species\n[Gguaaaaahk, Ggueeeeeeeeeehk!]\nThe Lv3 Treasure Eater, the only one to resist the Shriek of the Dead, tried to pull them apart and got between them, but it had the opposite effect. Like how the skeletons had tried to attack Lee Shin Woo, the Treasure Eaters also started to attack the Lv3 Treasure Eater without fear. \"Wow, this is huge.\"[Kiek!]\nWhile the Treasure Eaters were tied up in fighting amongst themselves, Lee Shin Woo cleaned up the skeletons running amuck. The Treasure Eaters were level 2 and possessed the Shriek of the Dead themselves, so he didn’t think it would work, but that was also his bias. As expected, before he used it himself, he couldn’t know how it would turn out. He had gotten another good experience this way.\n[New...bie...?]\"Die... You’ve recovered, Paul? You dumbass, I was worried about you!\"[Thanks... Joining...]\nThe moment he was about to shatter the Skeleton Warrior’s head with his Bursting Thunder skill, it had recovered from the effects of the Shriek of the Dead. Upon seeing that, Lee Shin Woo quickly withdrew his sword and patted its shoulder. Even while being dazed at Lee Shin Woo’s words of concern, it followed behind him.\n\"Those who have recovered, come over to this side! We can’t do anything by ourselves, but if we’re with our comrades, we can do anything!\"[I feel strength... from the newbie’s voice...!][Over here, this way...!][Kugegegegek!]\nHe coaxed the unscathed skeletons nearby and finished cleaning up the rest of the afflicted skeletons. Within the mayhem, all of the level 1 skeletons had already died, but the level 2 skeletons were fairly intact, and as a result, he gathered 15 Skeleton Warriors. Thıs content belongs to novel⦿fire.net\n\"Those wicked beings that are destroying the empire, let’s take them down together! Let’s pool our strength into one!\"[Defeat... together...!][Energy... is rising!]\n[Acting skill has become Lv3.]\nThe Skeleton Warriors, compared to the Skeleton Soldiers or Archers, were relatively solid. That was especially true regarding their fighting spirit, which had been ignited from Lee Shin Woo’s speech. But their idea of a system of command was still a mess, and just by him speaking a bit bravely, it felt a little bit like they had, at some point, recognized him as their superior. Though it was the best thing that could happen to him.\n[Kuook... Kuheeeeeeeeeek!]\nMeanwhile, at around the same time that Lee Shin Woo had rallied the Skeleton Warriors, the Treasure Eaters were suddenly finishing up their bloody battle. In the most awful way at that.\n[Kueeeeeeeeeek!]\nAbove the wreckage of the now ruined building, the sole remaining Lv3 Treasure Eater cried out as the winner. After being half torn apart and eaten, the corpses of the other abandoned Treasure Eaters truly looked pitiful. But Lee Shin Woo wasn’t very surprised, as he knew about halfway through that this is how it would turn out.\n\"I can get all the treasure if I take care of that one guy anyway. And it got a lot of injuries from fighting too...\"[Report to... superiors...!]\"Yeah, yeah, I got it. But we gotta take down that guy first, right?\"\nAlthough they didn’t even have any superiors to report to, the Skeleton Warriors kept talking about superiors, so Lee Shin Woo adequately appeased them, and raised his sword high. It was a sort of provocation towards the Treasure Eater.Despite the thick dust filling the environment, due to the chaos that had occurred everywhere, his raised Bone of Thunder Lasting radiated light. Despite it changing into bone, the blade still gleamed with light, a truly mysterious sight.\n[Kuhaaaaaaaaaa!][The Lv3 Treasure Eater used Shriek of the Dead, but it failed due to lack of mana!]\n\"Nice timing. Let’s go, guys!\"[I got it!][Protecting the Empire...! That’s the will of... General Seagald...!]\nSo, what the hell did General Seagald do!? No wait, I heard that asshole plotted treason!\n[Kuaaaaaaaaaaah!]\nAs soon as the Treasure Eater failed its Shriek of the Dead, it seemed to become extremely uneasy, as it faced the charging Skeleton Warriors and cried out a manaless shriek for a while. Then, it charged forward. Its force came close to that of a speeding locomotive! The Skeleton Warriors tried to charge at the Treasure Eater and foolishly attempted it head-on...\n\"Dodge what attacks you can! We’ll survive and protect the Empire!\"[Oh, Ooooh...!][I’ll follow... your words!]\nHe used his Sprint and leaped high into the air. The words Lee Shin Woo had blurted out seemed to stir a feeling within each Skeleton Warrior, as they changed their minds and engaged in evasive maneuvers. Of course, there were some who couldn’t keep up with the Treasure Eater’s speed, so they were struck in the front, but luckily those guys didn’t die in one hit, endured, and lodged their bone swords into the Treasure Eater’s flesh. ’Even when it’s rotten, it’s still a herring’[1] ; it’s worth surviving for this long!\n\"Bursting Thunder!\"\nDue to these guys’ efforts, the Treasure Eater’s charge had been halted; Lee Shin Woo aimed for that timing and attacked. Since it had risen to its utmost, he aimed for its head and plummeted down; he pierced with his sword, striking down with force akin to lightning.\n[Critical Hit!][Gguweeeeeek!]\nThough Bursting Thunder was nothing more than a passive skill, the moment he clashed against an enemy with a melee weapon, following the harmonization between his body’s movements and his mana, an explosive force would occur, to the point that it could rightly be called a mystery. If it had been at the intermediate level, this battle would already be over. And even if the skill was only low rank right now, after going through the dungeon, he had somewhat familiarized his body with the technique, so his sword strike was enough to exert a force akin to lightning against the Treasure Eater.\n\"Here, take one more!\"[Kuwaaaaahk!]\nHe could also interpret simple words now. It was saying that it hurt terrifyingly. Lee Shin Woo radiated light and dodged the Treasure Eater spewing rotten blood. He used his Sprint to jump again and safely landed on the ground. He saw some Skeleton Warriors who hadn’t been able to dodge its rampage and get crushed.\n\"Dodge, even if you have to roll on the floor! And stab your swords into that guy!\"[Ugh... as a warrior, as a soldier...! I’ll face it!][Avoid it...! You have to avoid its attacks so that you can protect the Empire...!][We’re the Empire’s proud warriors...!]\nThe true intent behind his words was ’it’s hard for me to beat this guy alone, so you guys can’t die on me already!’, but the Skeleton Warriors took it as encouragement.Now, regardless of what he said, the Skeleton Warrior’s fighting spirit was increasing. He thought briefly, ’Is this what it feels like to be a religious leader of a pseudo-religion?’. If the God who made him into a skeleton was to see this scene, her blood pressure would rise and would feel unsteady.\n’In any case, I have to finish it before it recovers its mana. We’ve come more than halfway, more than halfway...!’\nHe checked the Treasure Eater’s condition, as well as the Skeleton Warriors’ condition, and intensely calculated how he should move next.If it seems like it was distracted by the Skeleton Warriors, he would provoke it by swinging his sword within its sight; and if it seemed like a lot of Skeleton Warriors would remain while the Treasure Eater was gradually accumulating damage, he would cold-heartedly lead them to their deaths. This situational decision making was an ability that he always had.\n[Kuek, Kuheeeeek...!]\nHow long did that gruesome battle go on? Through one of the Skeleton Warrior’s brilliant sacrifice, Lee Shin Woo blocked the Treasure Eater’s attack and forcefully struck with his sword. The moment he cleaved its rotten belly, the Treasure Eater coughed intensely and spewed out a blood clot.\n\"Now, guys! Gang up on him!\"[Keuhaaaaahp!][For the honor... of the Empire!]\nWhile it was dying, they had to rush it! Lee Shin Woo bobbed his hand, sending the signal, and the Skeleton Warriors simultaneously charged at the Treasure Eater. The Treasure Eater had become a mess and one by one, the Skeleton Warriors’ swords lodged deep into its flesh.\n[Kuhek, Kueeeeek...!]\nThe Treasure Eater spat out another clot of blood and was in pain. It was undoubtedly in a fatal state! Lee Shin Woo raised his sword and forcibly yelled. Now it was time to harvest the fruit of this long and distressing battle! The siege destruction formation (or ganging up) had paid off!\n\"We’re all the way there! Charge, I said charge! Stab more forcefully!\"[Killing it!][If I’m with you... I can go anywhere!]\nThe Skeleton Warriors charged behind Lee Shin Woo while saying words that felt somewhat burdensome to him. However, talking about the conclusion first, this became Lee Shin Woo’s greatest miscalculation in this battle.\n[Kik... Kigihiiiiiiiiiiii!]\nThe Treasure Eater spewed out a blood clot, raised its rotten eyes, and gazed at them. Immediately after, from within the blood clots, flames...\n\"Oh, hey wait a sec...\"The blood clots exploded in a grand fashion and covered the entire area!\n[1] T/N: It’s a saying that means something that’s originally good won’t wear out/change and/or someone’s nature/integrity won’t change. Basically, he’s saying that they still have their skill, even after they’ve degraded into skeletons.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 4 part4",
    "content": "<Chapter 4. Hunting Hero - 4>\n[Treasure Eater uses Flames of Resentment! Scorching flames cover the whole area!]\n[Critical Hit!]\nThe Lv2 Treasure Eater didn’t have that skill though! But he couldn’t complain. After all, when Lee Shin Woo realized that it was a higher level, he should’ve been suspicious that it had an ability that the Treasure Eaters up until now didn’t have.\nBecause he was sure he had grasped victory, Lee Shin Woo had forgotten his sense of danger and acted recklessly; it was his mistake.\n’It’s really a good realization. If I come out of these flames alive, it should be a profitable trade.’\nLee Shin Woo didn’t hold back, using all his strength in an attempt to get out of the scarlet flames that covered the chaotic battlefield no matter what. Though it wouldn’t be over if he died here, he can’t always rely on Invisible Heart!\nThe fact that he’d instinctually opened his inventory and grabbed his bone arrows the moment of the explosion was truly a wise response. Even though the strength contained in each individual arrow didn’t compare to the bones left behind from hunting monsters, they would at least be enough for first aid.\n’Bone Reinforcement, Bone Reinforcement! Use them all for Bone Reinforcement!’\nThe bone arrows were completely used up, and then his body, which had been entirely burnt by the huge explosion, was instantaneously healed.\nSince they were just normal bone arrows, they didn’t leave behind any experiences, memories, or skills, and his stats didn’t increase either, but it was enough that he had fortunately avoided an instantaneous death. Of course, he wasn’t out of the woods just yet.\n’Bones... I need more bones!’\nFortunately, the battlefield was filled with the bones of the skeletons that had died prior. However, the bones themselves were burning within the malevolent flames, so he would have to hurry up if he wanted to use them for Bone Reinforcement.\nIt was a relief that his circumstantial judgment was quick as he was soon able to collect several dozens of bones.\n’Bone Reinforcement! Bone Reinforcement!’\n[Your arm bone has been reinforced.]\n[Your leg bone has been reinforced.]\n[Your shoulder bone has been reinforced.]\n[Your arm bone has been reinforced.]\nHe couldn’t get anything more from the bones from regular Skeleton Soldiers anymore. But they would still heal him if he used Bone Reinforcement, and he saw his reddish bones barely return to their natural color.\nOf course, immediately after, he saw an even stronger flame rushing towards him, and he once again found himself in a dangerous situation. It was at that moment that he realized what a calamity fire was. Even more so since they were magical flames! ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ novel·fıre·net\n’Steve, you asshole...! Bone Reinforcement, Bone Reinforcement!’\n[Your arm bone has been reinforced.]\n[Your palm bone has been reinforced. Strength has increased by 1. Absorbing a portion of the Skeleton Warrior’s memories and experiences.]\n[You have to slash even harder. We’re the swords of the empire! - Nameless soldier.]\nFinally, the Skeleton Warriors’ bones were starting to get mixed in. Its healing effect was even better! Lee Shin Woo’s eyes gleamed and moved his body even faster. He needed to collect even more of these precious bones before they burned up!\n[Your arm bone has been reinforced.]\n[Your palm bone has been reinforced. Absorbing a portion of the Skeleton Warrior’s memories and experiences.]\n[It’s pointless if you swing your sword a thousand times but not manage to cut your enemy once. Our goal is to precisely kill an opponent with only one swing. - Nameless soldier]\n[Your palm bone has been reinforced. Strength has increased by 1. Absorbing a portion of the Skeleton Warrior’s memories and experiences.]\n[The imperial army is strong. We have to make everyone looking at us understand that. - Nameless soldier]\nIt seemed like he was being tested in reaction speed, and endurance at the same time.\nEven if he reinforced his bones to the point that he was breathless, he didn’t know whether the Treasure Eater’s flame would subside or not, and even if it did, it wasn’t like he could just sit there and do nothing, else he would quickly die.\nSince it’s come to this, he had thought about just dying once and resurrecting, but the more that came to mind, Lee Shin Woo obstinately decided to endure.\nHe had already died twice. That meant that if he hadn’t come to the empire without any extra lives, he would already be dead. He couldn’t accept becoming dependent on that technique.\n’I can’t die easily... Bone Reinforcement!’\n[Your palm bone has been reinforced. Absorbing a portion of the Skeleton Warrior’s memories and experiences.]\n[I did it! There was magic in my sword just now! - Nameless soldier]\nHe quickly sprinted through the raging flames and found bones. When he couldn’t find any more bones, he attempted to escape the raging flames, but to his shock, those flames stuck to his body and didn’t let go easily.\nIt was almost as if the Treasure Eater’s resenting will resides within the flames, gritting its teeth, and saying that it would kill him. And that wasn’t a misunderstanding. The surviving flames were tightening around his neck.\n’Then...’\nIf he didn’t kill the Treasure Eater, these flames wouldn’t disappear. He had realized this instinctually. The moment he was sure of it, Lee Shin Woo found the Treasure Eater and turned his body.\nThe flames had already spread in all directions, and it was a situation where he couldn’t even see properly, but the mana within these flames that stuck to his body was leading him. He himself thought it was strange that he could feel the mana, despite feeling the pain of his entire body being burned.\n’It’s this way.’\nDon’t they say that if you want revenge on someone, you’d have to dig two graves? This skill was truly like that. Its Flames of Resentment was a skill that burned its opponent by using its own blood and mana as fuel. Those two things are obviously closely connected to its lifeforce and magic.\nRight now, Lee Shin Woo could feel that connection. In this urgent situation, his ability was growing at an exponential rate.\n[The Beginner Magic Affinity skill has become Lv4.]\n[The Beginner Magic Affinity skill has become Lv5.]\n’Damn it!’\nThe fact that his Magic Affinity skill had increased was definitely something to be happy about, but it was becoming harder and harder to push through the flames and run.\nHe didn’t have any more bones to reinforce himself with, his bone body burned, and he could feel his ability gradually slipping.\n[The Beginner Magic Affinity skill has become Lv6.]\n[The Beginner Sprint skill has become Lv8.]\n’Sprint... Sprint!’\nWhenever he fought a hard battle, he only increasingly hated and regretted the him who was attached to the past.\n’Damn it...!’\nBut his health was gradually dropping, and it was at the moment he felt it drop; the moment he prepared for death and grit his teeth, the mass of mana inside his body changed his mind, and he felt it spread all across his body.\n[You have learned the active skill, Beginner Regeneration Lv5]\nHis bones, which felt like they would crumble, were saturated with magic and instantly returned it to a healthy state. More than anyone else, Lee Shin Woo was able to ascertain its effect. It was truly a simple skill; it would consume mana to regenerate the body! It was the same for bones!\nLee Shin Woo was curious as to how he had learned this skill, but he didn’t have the time to leisurely think about it right now. When he regained his energy, he used his Sprint and kicked off the floor, jumping into the sky!\n’There you are!’\nLee Shin Woo, who had briefly escaped the sea of flames, caught sight of the wriggling and moving Treasure Eater. Like him, the Treasure Eater was dying. But...\n[Kuhi... Kieeek...!]\nIt was sitting wickedly in the center of the flames, and then widened the distance; it then moved around as if it were drawing a circle. He felt like it would wait until he died and then the Treasure Eater would collect the treasure.\nLee Shin Woo was already pissed off, but he was also annoyed that he couldn’t do anything to it right now. He was way too far from it! It was great that he had awakened the Regeneration skill at the right time, but it had the disadvantage of using up magic. This meant that he’d run out of mana before he was able to take it down.\n’Even so, it’s not like I can shoot arrows from the sky...!’\nUnfortunately, his knowledge of archery was shoddy. Even if he had the skill, he had used all of his arrows back then to heal himself!\nEven while he grit his teeth, his body felt the force of gravity and was falling back towards the flame scorched ground. While falling, Lee Shin Woo suddenly, without any thought, naturally raised his left hand.\n[The passive skill, Beginner Archery Lv2 has been expunged.]\n[You have learned the active skill, Beginner Catapult Lv5.]\nThat feeling that he had experienced just a moment ago dominated his body. It was the feeling of awakening a skill! Following the Beginner Regeneration, he had awakened the Beginner Catapult skill!\n’Urgh!’\nThe brief and powerful pain accompanied his left index finger being pulled out, and just like the name implied, it shot out like an arrow. Most of the mana he had remaining was inside of that projectile.\nIts accuracy, as well as its speed, were incomparable to mere Beginner Archery; it cut through the air, burrowed into the middle of the Treasure Eater’s forehead, and in the end, penetrated through it. Since it had truly happened in the blink of an eye, Lee Shin Woo himself couldn’t track its path completely.\n[Gguiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiik!]\nHowever, the result was clear. The moment Lee Shin Woo dreadfully fell into the flames, the Treasure Eater gasped a horrific death rattle, and fell heavily with a thud.\nImmediately after, the flames that had been stuck to his body, as well as the flames filling his surroundings cleanly dissipated. He stood dumbfounded and lines of messages started appearing before him.\n[You have defeated a Lv3 Treasure Eater. You have achieved the feat of commanding your comrades and defeating an enemy that was at a higher level than you. All stats permanently increase by 2. You have acquired the passive skill, Command Lv1.]\n[You have acquired the title, ’Treasure Hunter’! Whenever you hunt monsters or explore a dungeon, it will become easier to acquire higher ranked rewards. The title box is open.]\n[As a reward for your feat, the proficiency of your combat related skills increases. Low Rank Bursting Thunder has become Lv2, Beginner Stealth Lv8, Beginner Shriek of the Dead Lv6, Beginner Catapult Lv6, and Beginner Command Lv3.]\nIt was extremely hectic. He was sure that the skill he had used at the final moment was the skill he had gained from the Ratman, and he didn’t think it’d have this much force.\nIt felt really empty where he lost a finger, but he had gained the Regeneration skill just in time, so whenever he gets enough mana, he can just regain the bone.\n’Wait a sec, did I perhaps get the Regeneration skill from the Queen?’\nLee Shin Woo recalled the Rat Queen’s ability, who had birthed the elites, and he automatically nodded his head. Regardless of how much mana it had, that number of births was rare and beyond measure. However, if it had a healing ability, he could understand that many births in that short amount of time.\n’Catapult, which would pull out a finger and launch it, and Regeneration which would restore that bone... who would have thought I would find such a perfect match in the same dungeon.’\nIn any case, he had survived because of those two skills. He thought it would’ve been better had they awakened a bit earlier, but... he couldn’t be too greedy. Because he had moved so intensely, he had also grown.\n\"Hoo, then... Wow, it’s a proper annihilation.\"\nAfter he was sure that he wasn’t at risk of dying anymore, he carefully stood up and surveyed his surroundings. There was nothing to survey. Since everything had turned to ashes.\nHe couldn’t find any Skeleton Soldiers’ or Skeleton Warriors’ bones. He did see some of the greatswords that the Skeleton Warrior’s had used remaining, but there weren’t any spears. Seeing that, he realized that the Skeleton Warriors were better with a sword than a spear.\n\"I’ll pick you guys up later. More importantly...\"\nAfter Lee Shin Woo checked that the other Treasure Eaters’ bodies had cleanly disappeared, he turned around while tears slightly flowed (even though he can’t cry). Despite him having no way of restoring them... he still had the biggest reward left.\nThe reward known as the Lv3 Treasure Eater’s corpse.",

    "content": "<Chapter 4. Hunting Hero - 5>\n\"Your big bro doesn’t expect much, Steve. May you spit out a piece of level 4 bone equipment.\"\nLee Shin Woo muttered unpleasantly and approached the Treasure Eater.\nIt was stiff, looking exactly like a cicada that had fallen from a tree and died, and its rotting flesh and its burns were covered in blood; it wasn’t exactly a great sight, but right now, to Lee Shin Woo’s (nonexistent) eyes, it looked like a stack of gold.\n\"Hoo... Heup.\"\nIt wasn’t anything special, so why was he shaking? Lee Shin Woo gently approached and with his index finger (that he regenerated with his mana) poked the body.\nAt that moment, the body divided into particles of light and fluttered away like spring cherry blossoms. He was able to see an undead completely disappear, and saw it naturally regress into mana for the first time! And he saw the inside of the orbs of light dropping onto the ground. These were the items that the Treasure Eater had left behind as it departed this world.\n[You have acquired the Lv3 Treasure Eater’s skull bone.]\n[You have acquired 14,960 Perium.]\n[You have acquired a Lv2 Iron Spear. It has transformed into a Lv1 Strong Bone Spear (+5).]\n[You have acquired a Lv2 Iron Shield. It has transformed into a Lv1 Strong Bone Shield (+5).]\n[You have acquired a Lv2 Blessed Rose Tree Staff. It has transformed into a Lv2 Blessed Bone Wand (+3).]\n[You have acquired a Lv3 Dire Wolf Bone Armor.]\nHe had acquired the Treasure Eater’s skull bone, 14,960 Perium, as well as a total of four items. Lee Shin Woo checked his list again and despaired.\n\"So, I really can’t collect the bones from the other Treasure Eaters...\"\nAmongst the treasures that they possessed, a portion of them had entered the Lv3 Treasure Eater’s storage organs, and he was able to collect them. However, due to this asshole’s Flames of Resentment, he couldn’t collect the other Treasure Eater’s bones. He thought that perhaps it would also store the others’ bones when it swallowed down the treasure, but that was just a silly dream.\nHe had gone through such a tough ordeal, yet he hadn’t been able to procure the elite monsters’ bones; Lee Shin Woo had realized that he had won this battle through reinforcing his bones, so in many ways, this situation was a bitter pill to swallow.\n\"If I learn magic, I should learn magic that extinguishes fire from my bones first...’\nHowever, it wasn’t all bad news. First off, the reward’s main dish, the treasure that the Lv3 Treasure Eater kept hold of dearly, was, fortunately, equipment composed of bone.\n[Dire Wolf Bone Armor]\n[Lv3]\n[Durability: 800/800]\n[Defense: 100 - 115]\n[Options: Increases Health by 20]\n\"If I just look at the abilities, it’s really simple, but...\"\nIn many ways, it was an item that didn’t seem very exciting compared to the grand Bone of Thunder Lasting, but despite that, the Dire Wolf Bone Armor was plenty amazing. That’s because its goal as defensive equipment was to protect the body, and it did that thoroughly.\nThis upper body armor, created out of auburn dyed dire wolf bones, was ridiculously sturdy, though he didn’t know how they had processed the bones. It was sturdy to the point that he’d find it troublesome and turn back if an opponent wearing this showed up. That was obvious since it was a piece of level 3 equipment.\nMoreover, just by wearing it, his health would increase by 20; it would increase his overall defense as well as increasing his stamina. Lee Shin Woo immediately equipped the armor.\nRegardless of how much he’d leveled or how much larger he’d gotten, he looked like just a normal Skeleton A who appeared in a beginner dungeon; but wearing this quite nice armor, and holding the Bone of Thunder Lasting, he had strength that wouldn’t make him envious of other considerable, named monsters. As expected, items are the best.\n’Good, it’s perfect. I shouldn’t hear them call me newbie anymore.’\nAside from that, there was other good news. The Blessed Rose Tree Staff transformed into a Blessed Bone Wand, and despite being level 2 equipment the item level hadn’t even decreased, and on the contrary, had actually been reinforced.\n[Lv2 Blessed Bone Wand (+3)]\n[Lv2]\n[Durability: 350/350]\n[Attack Power: 10 - 15]\n[Options: Increases Magic by 11, Increases Magic Casting Speed by 11%, Increases damage taken from living foes by 11%]\n\"In other words, there’s no guarantee that the change into bone is necessarily a downgrade.\"\nIt depended on the item; like in this case, when the change occurred, it would become stronger, or perhaps the item may even increase in level.\nHe felt much better, at least compared to when he thought that the item would always decrease in level. Of course, he didn’t really have a use for the wand right now, so he shoved it into his inventory.\n\"Good. Shall we get to to the real main dish?\"\nThe main dish was the Treasure Eater’s skull bone, which he had placed carefully on the floor. He picked up and raised the skull, and felt an unusual magic contained within. He could tell there was an intense heat that dwelled within.\nLee Shin Woo remembered the skill of the Treasure Eater that had threatened to annihilate him and the Skeleton Warriors alike, as well as pushing them into a crisis; after gulping down, he carefully activated his skill.\n\"...Bone Reinforcement.\"\n[You have reinforced your skull bone. Magic has increased by 15. Absorbing a portion of the Treasure Eater’s memories and experiences.]\n15! His magic had increased by as much as 15 all at once. He was attacked by the pain of the sudden change, but he was already somewhat prepared for it, so Lee Shin Woo calmly endured it.\nHe just followed the movement of mana. Within the pain that felt as if his head was being twisted, new mana welled up and expanded through his body; the mana was truly a refreshing sensation.\n’Ah...!’\nWhile that went on, a tiny flame bloomed within that mana. The instant Lee Shin Woo was about to exclaim after discovering it, it instantly swelled without him able to grab hold of it, and completely filled his entire body!\nFor a split second, a black flame rose up and then disappeared. Lee Shin Woo realized that the flame couldn’t harm him. A strong will dwelled within those flames. That was none other than his own will.\n[You have learned the active skill, Beginner Flames of Revenge.]\n[Beginner Flames of Revenge Lv1(Active)]\n[An Avenger’s tenacity is put into their magic and manifested in flames. It will pursue and latch onto your target and will not extinguish until you run out of mana, die, or your opponent dies. It can be extinguished by someone with higher Magic than you. It is also possible to incorporate the flames into your weapon.]\n’Huh?’\nThe skill it had used was definitely the Flames of Resentment. But for the skill name to change? Lee Shin Woo was puzzled by the name change but honestly, it was extremely obvious. That’s because when he reinforced his bones, he would just get the object’s memories and experiences, but he wouldn’t get the skills intact.\nIn other words, his own memories and experiences would be added to the skill that was manifested based on the person’s memories and experiences, so it was always possible that it would result in the skill taking on a completely different form. Like when he had absorbed the Ratman’s finger bone, he had awakened the Catapult ability, rather than the Ratman’s ability to launch its nails.\n\"...Hoo, now I’m feeling a little better.\"\nAfter the pain, as well as the dizziness from the sudden increase in magic had passed, Lee Shin Woo shook his head and got a hold of himself. He felt like the inside of his mind was much more refreshed. Though it was honestly still empty!\n’Alright, shall we adapt and move around our body?’\nHe had collected everything the Lv3 Treasure Eater had left behind, but there might be some loot still on the battlefield that he hadn’t collected. Even if he were to exclude the Skeleton Warriors’ greatswords that he could easily see, there may be bones buried under the ashes!\nAs a result of him searching the entire area for 30 minutes, Lee Shin Woo collected 15 Lv1 Long Bone Swords (+5), 1 Lv2 Treasure Eater lower jaw bone, 3 Skeleton Warriors’ palm bones, and lastly, 2,560 Perium.\nThe fact that even 1 Treasure Eater bone was left intact was truly a happy occasion, but... the problem was that it didn’t end with him just acquiring the bone.\n[You have acquired The Trickster’s token.]\n\"... What’s this?\"\nLee Shin Woo’s features frowned when he saw the gold coin in the palm of his hand, depicting a bizarre man wearing a helmet and shorts, with a spear in one hand and a trumpet in another. Naturally, the explanation for the item came up.\n[The Trickster’s token]\n[The token of a scammer who hates harmony, instigates disorder, and can plot anything. One is plenty enough, while two is too few.]\n\"...\"\nWhen he had first gotten the Slaughterer’s token, he was pretty sure he remembered that it would definitely be easier to obtain Slaughterer’s tokens than other types of tokens. And he thought that he’d done plenty enough here for him to earn another Slaughterer’s token.\nHowever, what is this? Trickster? What the hell is this? Is it saying that he had to gather both the Slaughterer’s tokens and the Trickster’s tokens? Lee Shin Woo furrowed his (nonexistent) brow and the moment he agonized over it, he observed the familiar distortion of mana. It was obviously a notice for a quest.\n[The quest, ’Slaughterer’s Token’ has been canceled.]\n[A new quest has been created.]\n\"...Ha.\"\n[A New Manipulator]\n[The faces you possess are extremely numerous. And not one of them is the truth. If that’s the case, fool everyone. If you do so, you can become anything! To be more specific, including The Trickster’s token, gather 10 different karma tokens.]\n[Quest progress - Trickster’s token 1/1, karma tokens 2/10]\n[Quest reward - 1 Lv6 Weapon Trickster’s arm bone]\n\"Wait a sec!?\"\nDifferent individual karma tokens? Is it telling him to gain other karma tokens like how he had gained the Slaughterer’s token and the Trickster’s token? Didn’t the quest difficulty go up outrageously!?\nHe thought about why he got this kind of token. He had thought that him acting like the Skeleton Warrior’s ally, leading them, as well as making them fight against the Treasure Eaters might’ve had a huge effect but... still, the reality is way too harsh!\nHe didn’t even know what conditions he’d have to fulfill to get the other karma tokens, and yet he had been given this quest; what the hell is a Trickster for him to get such a quest!?\n\"...It’ll be fine if I just ignore it, right? It probably won’t be much of a problem.\"\nThat’s what he said, but it actually weighed on his mind considerably. It was a quest that had appeared after chewing up the Slaughterer’s token quest. He couldn’t help but be curious. He wouldn’t have to gather 10 Trickster’s tokens, but including this one, he’d have to gather a total of 10 different karma tokens...\n’Ugh... it’s not like anything will happen right away by exerting myself, so let’s think about it carefreely.’ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ novęlfire.net\nUltimately, Lee Shin Woo decided to positively put this off. Rather than rot his brain from thinking too deeply about this, he decided to instead do his best when it comes to a situation where it seems like he’ll be able to progress the quest. After he decided to do so, he felt a bit more relieved.\n’Anyway, the quest reward changed, so it’s become kind of awkward to use the permit for God’s secret shop right away.’\nHe had pushed through the dungeon and the Treasure Eaters all at once, so he had come to possess a fortune of 25,000 Perium in no time. Whether he buys a bone or a magic book; he had enough of a fortune to reinforce himself! ...Is what he believed.\nHowever, since he didn’t have a promise for when he got his next permit right now, he refused to use his remaining permit without careful consideration. In the end, Lee Shin Woo sighed and changed his mind. He would continue to do what he had been doing first... in other words, cleanly mop up the level 1 dungeons in the nearby vicinity, and then go to the secret shop.\n’I’ve decided, so shall we hurry?’\nLee Shin Woo gently closed his (nonexistent) eyes and after checking where each dungeon was, he gripped his Bone of Thunder Lasting and hurried his steps. He had grown rapidly after the intense battle, and his steps definitely contained more strength than before.\nHe was currently level 2, and his stat total was 323. He was confident that he was growing at a ridiculous rate. Perhaps even beyond his own imagination.",

    "content": "<Chapter 5. Trickster’s Karma - 1>\nSince it was underground, it seemed normal to be unable to tell how much time has passed, but depending on the time, the Underground Empire would brighten and then darken, and then repeat. From what he had heard, the magic originating from the large scale magic spheres, that were set up and attached to the extremely high ceiling, made it possible, but it wasn’t really important to him.\n[Mr. Lee Shin Woo has entered the chatting channel.]\nWithin the silent darkness, Lee Shin Woo gently leaned against a rotten, decaying old tree, and then checked the chatting channel.\n[Lloyd H.K: Newbie, you’re not dead yet, right?]\n[Lee Shin Woo: Since you’ve been worrying about me, I’m still alive.]\n[Lloyd H.K: Good, you’re doing well.]\nNaturally, Lee Shin Woo didn’t need to sleep (not like he could), so regardless of whether his surroundings were light or dark, he continued to move; but he was mentally exhausted after clearing another dungeon following the battle with the Treasure Eater, so he didn’t feel like moving.\nTherefore, he decided to rest using night time as an excuse, as well as snoop around the chatting channel.\n[Lee Shin Woo: Senior, you’re not going to sleep?]\n[Lloyd H.K: I feel like I’ll be ok for about four more days.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: Aha.]\n’Perhaps that guy’s also undead’, he thought, but there was no way he’d be. It was just that the higher one’s level was, the higher their physical abilities, so the less sleep they’d need.\n[Prince Altania: Lloyd, how are you always in here? You’re not in here all day, are you? Please tell me you’re not.]\n[Lloyd H.K: Shut up. I’m actually getting ready to give a group of undead a proper beat down, you know.]\n[Prince Altania: Well, it seems like you’re still diligently doing those hero quests that don’t give you much of a reward... Just quit it right now. I discovered a level 5 dungeon, you know? If you want, I can put you in my party.]\n[Lloyd H.K: Hmm... send the location to my personal channel. I’ll finish up here and go immediately.]\n[Prince Altania: In the end, you’re still going to do the quest. What an amazing sense of duty.]\nA personal channel. Contrary to the chatting channel, a personal channel allowed heroes to send messages to and from each other, and it hadn’t yet opened for Lee Shin Woo. Of course, even if it opened, there wasn’t anyone to really use it with.\n[Shino Rendu: A dungeon? Hey, let me in too.]\n[Prince Altania: You’re still level 5. Don’t you know the fundamental rule; that you need to be one level higher than the dungeon you’re entering?]\n[Shino Rendu: Ugh, that’s true, but...]\n[Lloyd H.K: Sorry, Shino. Ah, I need some help here, do you think you could help me out? I can also share the quest with you.]\n[Shino Rendu: It’s fine.]\n[Mr. Shino Rendu has left.]\n[Lloyd H.K: Oh well... It’s quick going from level 5 to level 6. I should encourage him later.]\n[Prince Altania: Lloyd, you nanny...]\nLloyd and the Prince spoke about this or that, and it seemed like they were quite close. It must mean that they’ve spent a lot of time together after they dropped into this world.\nLloyd was good-natured and honest while the Prince was immature and said whatever he wanted; it did seem like they were a good combination.\n[Ms. Ye Jin Jin has entered the chatting channel.]\n[Ye Jin Jin: E-everyone. Have you all seen it, too? That thing!]\n[Lloyd H.K: Oh, it’s been a long time, newbie. Now that I think about it, you’re not a newbie anymore. Did you know that you have a stronger junior under you now?]\n[Prince Altania: Ye Jin Jin? I haven’t seen you in a long time, so I thought you were dead.]\n[Ye Jin Jin: I-I’m not dead, you know! But more importantly, a stronger junior...? Ah, that’s not it. The horse is the problem right now, the horse!]\n[Erian Ruparte: ...A horse? Jin Jin, what horse?]\nLee Shin Woo half listened to what his seniors were chattering on about and rested. He held a circular chip in his hand that looked similar to a gold coin; it had a muscular warrior wielding a greatsword engraved on it.\n[The Fighter’s Token]\n[A warrior who never looks back and struggles valorously. To a fighter, any plan, or aid is but a hindrance.]\n\"So, this does come out...\"\nHe did want to obtain these tokens, but he didn’t know what he’d need to do to obtain them. For him to just get one for clearing a dungeon... If he were to quibble as to why this token came out, he thought that it was due to him pushing through the dungeon in a straight line without using any skills.\n’I had wanted to raise my Regeneration skill, but I got flustered since I didn’t get hurt at all.’\nWhen he had fought against the Treasure Eater, Lee Shin Woo had significantly grown in battle experience, as well as stats after his battle with the Treasure Eater, so he could no longer feel any danger from level 1 dungeons; he had put forward his Bone of Thunder Lasting and pushed through the dungeon.\nHe had intended to train his Regeneration skill by using it whenever he was injured and thus increase his proficiency in it, but the dungeon was too easy, so he hadn’t been able to use his Regeneration skill.\nThe boss was level 2, but its attack power, as well as its endurance, were just a little bit higher than the Ratman. But he didn’t need any other skills aside from Bursting Thunder to take it down.\nAfter thoughtlessly clearing the dungeon like that, he had gained the Fighter’s token. Since he had gained something, it was worthwhile pushing through the dungeon so ignorantly.\n’Perhaps... it might be better to hold onto a solid singular concept to get other karma tokens.’\nBy slaughtering, he gained the Slaughterer’s token. By pushing through the dungeon in a straight line without the use of skills (perhaps the time it took to push through the dungeon or his combat style had an effect), he had gained the Fighter’s token. In a battle where he had fooled the Skeleton Warriors, and lead them to their deaths, he had gained the Trickster’s token.\nIf it followed that logic, then he thought it might be best to pull the other abilities he possesses into a single concept in order to clear the quest. However, he smiled bitterly.\n’Ha, talk is cheap.’\nWhat concept is he even supposed to choose? Moreover, there wasn’t any guarantee that he’d continue to face easy battles that he’d be able to plow through without using all his strength. Regardless of how hard he tried to think positively, his head just hurt, so he just stopped and shook his head.\n[Ye Jin Jin: I’m telling you it’s true. A Skeleton Horse that can run extremely fast! It’s really scary and really fast!]\n[Yasunori Akira: ...What crap. If it were an undead, then it’d be hostile to humans. Have you forgotten the basics?]\n[Lloyd H.K: Newbie... No wait, you’re not. Ye Jin Jin. Explain it in more detail. First off, it’s really an undead, right?]\n[Ye Jin Jin: That’s what I’m saying. It was all bone, and where its two eyes should be, deep blue goblin fire was burning... it’s as scary as a named Skeleton Knight!]\n[Prince Altania: A Skeleton Knight’s nothing, whether it’s named or not.]\n[Erian Ruparte: Sir Altania, Jin Jin is still level 3. Please fix that insensitive speech habit of yours.]\nHis seniors were still busy saying strange things in the chatting channel. However, Lee Shin Woo thought since skeleton heroes exist, a skeleton that just runs wasn’t very strange, so he stopped paying attention early on in the conversation.\n[Lee Shin Woo: Then, I’ll get going so I can rest.]\n[Lloyd H.K: Alright. Please don’t die.]\n[Ye Jin Jin: Ah, you’re the newbie, huh! It’s nice to meet you! If you don’t know something, you can ask me!]\n[Prince Altania: That newbie is stronger than you, you know. Just take care of yourself.]\n[Ye Jin Jin: Ugh...]\nLee Shin Woo gently smiled as he heard the voice of a frustrated young girl and left the chatting channel. Despite being cursed and sent down to this distorted world, the fact that there were a lot of others who were trying their best to survive aside from himself became more than just a small comfort for him.\n’Hoo, then let’s go to the next dungeon.’\nHis energy had returned. Lee Shin Woo energetically stood up and hurried along the path to the next dungeon. His goal: gaining a token for every dungeon clear!\nHe already had a concept in mind that he’d use to clear the next dungeon. He had both the Stealth and Catapult skills, so he thought that if he balanced them correctly, he would get an assassination related karma as well as the corresponding token.\n’Stealth is also fun the more you do it. I think I can do it with a beginner level skill, as long as my enemies don’t discover me first.’\nLee Shin Woo, who realized that Stealth was an effective skill that didn’t take up a lot of mana, was training his Stealth whenever he fundamentally moved.\nHe had learned everything there was to Stealth from the rats. He would lower his body, move closer to the darkness than the light, and make as little noise as possible. If he grasped the direction he heard someone approach from first and avoided them, he probably wouldn’t be discovered.\n[Gu...wooooh...]\nLike right now.\n’Huh!?’ Google seaʀᴄh NoveI(F)ire.net\nHe survived because he was using Stealth. He was really thankful for his senses right now! Lee Shin Woo saw a giant monster come out from the darkness and into the moonlight; he desperately calmed himself down so that he wouldn’t make a sound. He didn’t even know where it popped out from!\n[There’s nothing... to eat...]\n[Lv3 Giant Zombie - Edward L. Baker]\n’That’s crazy...!’\nThis was a real named monster! It was similarly level 3 like the Treasure Eater, but he felt an incomparably brutal spirit coming from the zombie.\nIts movements were slow, but its frame was so big that it seemed to move several meters in a single step; its huge eyes that constantly swayed around were a rotten yellow, inciting a feeling of disgust. Above all, a faint green mist was spreading from its body and when he slightly touched it, a message appeared.\n[You are being exposed to the Elite Giant Zombie’s Acid Poison. Please hurry and escape the hazardous area and begin treatment.]\nIt was only a touch, yet he was afflicted by a horrific pain. However, he would be discovered if he made a sound, so Lee Shin Woo frantically endured and slowly, extremely slowly moved while maintaining Stealth.\n’Just a little more, just a little...’\n[There are... no bodies...]\nThe sight of his own legs melting away was an extremely horrific experience. And just through its presence alone, it had created that horrific scene; the fact that he had to hastily run in the current situation infuriated him.\nHowever, his life came first right now. After all, he had sworn that he wouldn’t let his Invisible Heart activate from now on!\nHe moved with his superhuman endurance and got as far as possible from the zombie. Fortunately, its senses seemed dull like a true zombie, as it didn’t notice Lee Shin Woo and started to walk slowly in the opposite direction.\n[If I just eat... a little more...]\nThe Giant Zombie, Edward, spoke ominously until the very end and disappeared into the distance. After Lee Shin Woo was sure that he’d managed to safely escape the range of the Acid Poison, he sighed in relief, and once again promised that he’d continue to maintain Stealth when he was outside of the dungeons from now on.\nIt was really fortunate that the zombie hadn’t shown up when he had fought the Treasure Eater!\n’Then.’\nLee Shin Woo activated his Regeneration. He had collected a heap of level 1 monster bones from the previous dungeon in case of an emergency (level 1 monster bones wouldn’t raise his stats anymore), but since he had mana, he didn’t need to use up the bones.\nRather, it was better to increase his proficiency in Beginner Regeneration when he could.\n’Regeneration!’\n[Activating Beginner Regeneration. Consuming mana to restore the body.]\n[Beginner Regeneration has become Lv6.]\nHis Regeneration responded fiercely as the zombie’s Acid Poison had almost completely melted away the lower half of his body. To the point that the skill leveled up!\nThe mana responded vigorously with a faint light within the darkness. As expected, not using his Regeneration the instant he sustained an injury was the answer. If he had, the Giant Zombie would’ve noticed him, and he would’ve died on the spot.\n’At any rate, the armor is really great.’\nBecause the Acid Poison was in the form of a gas, it got inside his armor and did indeed melt his upper body, but compared to his lower body, the damage was minimal, to the point that he couldn’t see any damage to the armor with the naked (nonexistent) eye!\n’I have to quickly get some lower body armor too.’\nHe immediately vowed after checking that his body was fully healed. It would be ideal if it were excellent equipment like the Dire Wolf Bone Armor, but if that’s not possible, a level 2 item is fine, too!\nBut when he pounded on his legs and tried to hurry along, a message appeared.\n[You have acquired a target for the Beginner Avenger skill. When you fight it again, all your abilities increase by 20%.]\n[You have achieved the feat of escaping from an enemy, despite them being at a higher level than you. Agility has increased by 2. Beginner Stealth has become Lv9.]\n[You have acquired the Avenger’s token.]\n... Why was it that he didn’t feel happy at all, despite achieving a feat? Moreover, he had already received the Avenger’s karma, yet he had received an Avenger’s token; so, it was possible, after all.\nNo, but was it possible for him to take down that guy the next time they meet? Even though his body would melt just from being close to him?\n’...Hoo.’\nLee Shin Woo thought of several things, sighed deeply, and then hurried his steps. It was then that a fire was lit within him, and he vowed to get stronger even faster than before.\nOf course, he was definitely still maintaining his Stealth skill at that very moment.",

Info on the dungeon is added to your minimap. All of your actions in the dungeon are buffed.][Beginner Magic Affinity has become Lv10 and has developed into Low Rank Magic Affinity. Magic has increased by 10. The higher the skill, the more your magic permanently increases while the effectiveness of mana recovery increases proportionally.]\n\"There we go.\"\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo acquired the permit, he confirmed that his Magic Affinity had grown and yelled delightedly. Of course, whenever he obtained a dungeon permit, there would be an intense flow of mana, and this mana helped improve his Magic Affinity; so he had anticipated that his skill would level up. Still, he was happy. It wasn’t just a simple level up. Rather, it had risen to the low rank stage.\n’That’s because there are about three insurmountable four-dimensional walls between a beginner skill and a low rank skill.’\nThe instant the skill had been reborn as a low rank skill, he felt the flow of the surrounding mana change and he laughed satisfyingly (though he’s a skeleton, his ribs didn’t even budge), and checked his status.\n[Lee Shin Woo][Skeleton Avenger Blessed by God][Treasure Hunter][Lv - 2 (Status Effectiveness 110%)][Strength - 94 Agility - 91 Health - 93 Magic - 86][Passive skills - Invisible Heart Lv3, Acting Lv4, Beginner Avenger Lv1, Low Rank Bursting Thunder Lv3, Low Rank Magic Affinity Lv1, Low Rank Stealth Lv3, Beginner Command Lv3][Active skills - Bone Reinforcement Lv3, Low Rank Sprint Lv2, Beginner Shriek of the Dead Lv9, Beginner Regeneration Lv7, Beginner Catapult Lv8, Beginner Flames of Revenge Lv3, Beginner Power Slash Lv5]\nHe currently had three skills that had started at the beginner stage and had grown to be low rank, and these skills were Magic Affinity, Stealth, and lastly, Sprint.\nEver since his encounter with the Giant Zombie, he had been using Stealth at all times, so it was natural that it had grown. He used Sprint the most since he possessed the Undead’s characteristic of never tiring, and on the back of that, it had risen to the low rank level.When these skills became low rank skills, he had obviously gained some stats, and if he were to compare them to when they were at the beginner level, their performance was completely different; they were supplementing his fighting ability.\n[Low Rank Stealth Lv3 (Passive)][You hide your presence and move such that your opponent doesn’t notice you. You can conceal any signs of your presence as well as your mana.]\nAmongst those skills, Sprint was especially amazing. It had a huge effect in increasing his speed regarding his travel, evasion, and of course his attacks as well, but when it rose to the low rank stage, it became much easier to put that speed into his attacks. With just that, it felt like his fighting ability had increased by 30%.\nAside from that, Power Slash infused magic into his weapon, from which he would then forcefully slash; it was usually a skill learned at the very beginning by warrior classes in games and felt like it was their exclusive active attack skill.It was a skill he had learned from the memories and experiences of the Skeleton Warriors; despite having several skills, he hadn’t had a truly powerful one hit kill move until then, so Power Slash was like rain after a long drought for him. Of course, it had particularly good compatibility with Sprint.\nHowever, if he were to ask if he could win against the named Giant Zombie, Edward, head to head, now that he’d gotten stronger, he would say he definitely couldn’t. It had already been four days since he had encountered and run away from the Giant Zombie, but even now, when he thought back at its strength, his bones quivered. Even when he had encountered the Lv3 Treasure Hunter, he hadn’t felt such vast despair...It was probably close to a Lv4 elite. Basically, a monster amongst monsters. Despite that, he felt a murderous intent towards the zombie from time to time, so it may be an effect from accepting the Avenger’s karma.\n’But it’s still too early. My magic rose by 10 this time, so my stats total 364, but... they said that my stats have to total 400 to get to level 3. For now, I’ll think about it after getting to level 3.’\nHe heard that information from the chatting channel. It was the result of secretly throwing out a question to Lloyd, who had been complaining that he still needed 2,000 more stat potions before he reached level 7.He didn’t even need to suspiciously ask until he got an answer. Since even his seniors who didn’t usually talk complained at the talk of stat potions and told him the whole story. To get to level 2, one needed 200 stats, for level 3, 400 stats, and for level 4, 800 stats... each subsequent higher level requires double the stats. Honestly, when he saw his seniors just chattering away that they were level 6, he thought that they may all just be lousy, but when he realized that they had reached at least a total of 3,200 stats, he completely discarded such thoughts. Right now, they could break him with one flick of their fingers.\n’I lied to my seniors that I was level 4, so I gotta move faster.’\nHe organized his thoughts and his sight was fixed upon the giant manhole in front of him. It seemed like it was a ladder that only he, who had acquired the permit for the dungeon, could use. He took a short deep breath and started to go down the ladder.\n\"Umhp...\"\nHe had become quite accustomed to entering dungeons now, since he had gone through five dungeons in the past four days. Though they were only level 1 dungeons. And the last level 1 dungeon in the vicinity was this one.\n’I’ll quickly finish up with this dungeon and then go to the shop. It’d be great if a lot of Perium came out.’\nHis anticipation for the dungeons had cooled off compared to his first time. To be honest, he didn’t think the regular mobs would give him a good skill, but he did have some anticipation that the boss might; but it ended up being a bust. Even if they had a skill, he had already absorbed a lot of skills, so it only ended up increasing his proficiency. The bosses in the Rural Rat Nest were the only special ones. It wasn’t common for a monster to use its nails or attack by birthing monsters. He could now conclude that.\n\"They said it was the sewers, and it’s truly, really dark in here...’\nHe probably wouldn’t be able to gain many stats or skills in this dungeon as well, but he’d get Perium here. Lee Shin Woo planned to go to the secret shop soon after and buy a bone. He didn’t know if it would be possible to level up by buying the bone, but he didn’t plan on putting off going to the shop any further.\n\"Hoo.\"\nAt around the bottom of the ladder, he jumped off and nimbly landed on the ground. He jumped from 2 meters high, yet his landing was truly light as if he were moving like a cat. It hadn’t even been 10 days since he’d been dropped onto this world, yet he felt a certain degree of dignity. It showed just by the fact that as soon as he landed on the ground, he ensured he was safe and checked his surroundings.\n- Seureureuk\n\"Huh...?\" The source of thɪs content is noveⅼfire.net\nLee Shin Woo heard something sliding towards him and his (nonexistent) ears pricked up. In certain dungeons, he would have to explore for about an hour before he would encounter any monsters, while in other dungeons, mannerless monsters would be guarding the entrance. It seems that the dungeon was the latter this time.\n[Gureureureureu]\nAt that moment, an opponent appeared from the darkness, one whose identity was difficult to ascertain. It attacked him, accompanied by the sound of a strange cry that made it even more difficult to figure out what it was.However, because it was so slow, befitting a level 1 monster, Lee Shin Woo struck with his Bone of Thunder Lasting and slashed the monster’s body without much difficulty. At that moment, he felt a strange sensation, like he was cutting apart a warm and tough jelly, making him shiver.\n[You have hunted a Lv1 Sewer Slime.]\n\"Wow, it’s truly...?\"\nThe slime monster that had been split into two pieces emitted a bubbling sound and instantly evaporated. Lee Shin Woo, who had been watching that, looked really awful. Indeed, if it’s fantasy, there have to be slimes, and if there are slimes, it has to be fantasy. Lee Shin Woo had expected them to show up at some point. However, he didn’t want to meet them. That’s because slimes didn’t have any bones.\n\"It’s not even worth my time to kill them... Huh?\"\n[You have acquired a deteriorated Skeleton Soldier’s arm bone.][You have acquired 12 Perium.]\nSo it was worthwhile after all. He didn’t know why, but a Skeleton Soldier’s arm bone had popped out where the slime had died!Lee Shin Woo was momentarily puzzled but he soon figured out the reason. In exchange for the slimes not having any bones, it seemed like they would spit out any bones that they had ingested before!\n\"Yeah, isn’t this really profitable...?\"\nHe felt somewhat uneasy that the bones were deteriorated, but it couldn’t be helped. Lee Shin Woo was about to put it into his inventory, but it felt awkward so he just decided to use it to reinforce his bones.Though he may die and die again a hundred times[1], he had gathered more than enough bones to restore himself.\n[You have reinforced your arm bone. Absorbing the Skeleton Soldier’s memories and experiences.][Gugeugaaaaahk, I’m melting, I’m melting! My C3 cervical vertebrae...! - Nameless soldier]\n\"...\"\nHe didn’t think he’d gain the memories of a skeleton’s last moments dying to a slime. Isn’t this memory going in a new direction?!Lee Shin Woo was seriously seized by an uncomfortable feeling. However, since he had gotten plenty of Skeleton Soldier’s memories, he thought that it didn’t matter whatever happened.\n\"Good, now shall we explore in earnest... Ah, before that.\"\nHe needed to choose a concept if he wanted to receive a karma token from this dungeon. Last time, when he had run away from the Giant Zombie, he had safely acquired the Avenger’s token. After that, whenever he went into a dungeon, he would wring his (nonexistent) brain and would go through the dungeon with a completely different concept. Amongst those, the successful ones were the NINJA concept (the Assassin’s token), where he moved covertly and killed his opponents one by one, and Lelouch Lamperouge’s concept (Mastermind’s Token), where he used his Shriek of the Dead to make his enemies kill each other. Right now, he had the Slaughterer, Trickster, Fighter, Avenger, Assassin, and Mastermind tokens, a total of six karma tokens.\n’...However.’\nHe only needed to get four more tokens from now on! Well, there was a time when he thought so positively. However, that great situation was nothing more than a delusion. Getting those four tokens was extremely hard.\n\"The shield warrior concept... no, I failed at this last time. Then how about the berserker concept... I failed at that too.\"\nHe had tried the Lee Bong Ju[2] concept, where he ran through the dungeon fighting as few monsters as possible, and the Gandhi concept, where he similarly went through the dungeon as peacefully as possible without fighting, but they had failed. He realized after that they both weren’t concepts that should be used in the dungeon. Since it’s come to this, it might be better to try the Emperor concept. It was demanding 100 bones of the same race from his enemies in exchange for their lives. He had promised that he would use that later when he found monsters that he could actually talk to.\n’Hoo, then I have no choice... Since my magic has increased, let’s go with the Sniper concept.’\nLee Shin Woo didn’t have any alternatives, so he went with the concept that he had held back, the Sniper concept. Due to the mana he used to regenerate his fingers whenever he used Catapult up until now, he hadn’t been able to focus entirely on the Sniper concept, but since Magic Affinity had become a low rank skill, it felt like it might be possible now.\n’I really hope that a usable skill comes out here.’\nLee Shin Woo made up his mind and after putting his sword into his inventory, pointed his finger and slowly walked into the dungeon. Up until now, no hero had dared enter a sewer dungeon (it was way too dirty); the moment the first explorer had appeared...\n[1] T/N: Famous Korean saying from the Goryeo dynasty. It describes something that remains unchanging. In this case, it’s the fact that he’ll have enough stockpiled bones, regardless of how many times he needs to use them to heal himself.\n[2] T/N: Lee Bong Ju is a South Korean marathoner.",

    "content": "<Chapter 5. Trickster’s Karma - 3>\n[The Slime’s weak Acid Poison is melting your body.]\nLee Shin Woo gave up the Sniper concept, only 10 minutes after making up his mind. The reason was simple. There were too many slimes that inhabited the sewers for him to pick them off one by one.\n[Gureuk]\n[Gureureureuk]\n\"Ha.\"\nAt least at this very moment, he was thankful that he was a skeleton. The slimes that were overflowing in all directions were stuck above his head, his back, and his legs, and were making a ’gureureuk’ sound; if he still had a normal way of thinking about hygiene like a human, he probably would’ve ran away from here a while ago.\n[Gureureureureuk!]\n[Gureukgureuk]\n[Gureureureu]\n’Moreover, they’re just level 1 sewer slimes inhabiting a lousy level 1 sewer dungeon, so they probably didn’t think it’d have much appeal. So, that’s why all of them avoided the sewers, and as a result, the slimes kept piling up more and more until... they multiplied this much.’\nIt had been 15 minutes since he’d entered the dungeon, and Lee Shin Woo’s entire body was buried under slimes without a way out. If he was a normal Skeleton Soldier, he would’ve already completely melted away and disappeared within a minute.\nHowever, unfortunately for the slimes, he was level 2, closing in on level 3, his stats had also swelled by another 10 from the dungeon permit, and... the decisive factor was that he was a skeleton that possessed the Regeneration skill.\n’My gear might get damaged so let’s go naked.’\nHe had fought against the slimes for a few minutes, but ultimately became concerned that his equipment would get damaged from the slimes’ Acid Poison, so he de-equipped it all. He naturally put his armor into his inventory, as well as his sword!\n’Alright, this should be fine with only my naturally recovering mana.’\nAs soon as he took off his armor, the health increase effect from the armor disappeared, and he started to incur more injuries from the slimes’ Acid Poison attacks, but it was at a level that his Beginner Regeneration skill could bear. Of course, if his Magic Affinity hadn’t reached the low rank stage, he wouldn’t have even dreamed of doing this.\n\"Heup.\"\n[Gureuk!]\n[Ggoreuk!]\nDespite de-equipping his gear, he didn’t have any difficulty whatsoever hunting the slimes. Not only was his level higher than the slimes, but the combat technique he had learned, Bursting Thunder, was a technique that could also be used unarmed.\n\"Heup!\"\n[Ggureuk!]\nSomeone from the outside may see this scene as unusual; a swelling wave of slimes. There were so many of themthat it looked like a sea of slime. But truthfully, Lee Shin Woo was in there, killing slimes left and right.\n\"Ha!\"\n[Ggeureuk...]\n[Ggik!]\nWhether he’s unleashing Bursting Thunder with a sword, a spear, an axe, or his fists, it would converge at one point. As fast and as hot as exploding lightning! That was Bursting Thunder’s start and finish!\nThough there wasn’t any mana within the attack, the force created by his two fists was plenty strong enough. Whenever that tremendous strength condensed in his arms passed through the slimes, they would turn to particles of light and disappear.\n[You have acquired 12 Perium.]\n[You have acquired 12 Perium.]\n[You have acquired a deteriorated Skeleton Soldier’s leg bone.]\n[You have acquired 12 Perium.]\n[You have acquired a deteriorated Zombie’s shin bone.]\n\"Bone Reinforcement, Bone Reinforcement.\"\nAs soon as he collected the Perium, it went straight to his inventory, but when he acquired the bones, he would immediately use them to reinforce his bones. One of his goals was regenerating his body, but as expected, the most important thing was his curiosity regarding the common memories that only those ingested by the slimes had.\n[My body’s melting. You weren’t satisfied with my already melted skin, muscles, blood, and flesh. Now you’re trying to melt my bones, which is all I have left. - Nameless skeleton]\n[Ggueeeeeeek. I can’t avoid the flood; it’s a slumber more suffocating than death. An eternal slumber is approaching...! - Nameless zombie]\nHe could only absorb the memories at their time of death, but Lee Shin Woo thought there was a reason for that here. To be more specific, he was excited that he might get a skill.\n[Ggureuk!]\n[Ggirek!]\n\"Bone Reinforcement.\"\n[Guaaaaahk, my head’s breaking. It’s sinking in! - Nameless skeleton]\n[Kuheuk, General Leofield...! I’ll go down in history before you... - Nameless skeleton]\n[Ggorok!]\n[Gureureu!]\n\"Bone Reinforcement.\"\n[Jjijijijijijijijik! - Nameless Rural Rat]\n[Gugehk... To think that my end comes from the city’s cleaning crew... - Nameless zombie]\nHowever, it seemed like the skill this time was no joke, as there was no reaction to absorbing dozens of bones, neither in stats, nor in skills.\nMoreover, he was really bothered by the skeletons that strangely had their consciousness intact, leaving their wills behind! He also remembered hearing about Leofield before! He must be just as famous as Seagald!\n[Beginner Regeneration has become Lv8.]\nEven so, it wasn’t like this dungeon was a complete miss. Setting aside the amount of stockpiled Perium from the huge mob, he had been looking for a place to train his Regeneration skill, and this here was the optimum environment to train it in.\nEven as he continuously took damage from all directions, he could continuously keep his Regeneration skill active with just the mana he had. His proficiency in Regeneration was increasing so quickly that he wondered if this place was created to train the Regeneration skill.\n\"Hoo.\"\n[Gureuk!]\n[You have acquired 12 Perium.]\n[You have acquired 12 Perium.]\nIf there was one more beneficial point, it was that his proficiency in barehanded combat was gradually increasing, something he hadn’t had the time to study in-depth.\nOf course, his fists couldn’t match up to the force of his level 3 weapon, but he could unleash strikes with plenty of destructive force with his bone fists. Above all, he was attacking with both hands without resting one or the other, so his attack speed was incomparable to when he wielded a weapon.\n’Bursting Thunder... it’s not enough to call it an amazing technique.’\nHe wasn’t just surprised by its destructive power and its speed. The more he used the skill, as well as the more his proficiency in said skill grew, the more he felt that his perspective during battle changed.\nHe thought about where he would need to attack for it to be the most effective, what timing and how he would retreat to get an opportunity; these thoughts rose up instinctually, and if he moved accordingly, his proficiency of the skill increased a ton. It was a skill that included all close combat techniques, and the meaning behind that certainly wasn’t light.\n’To think he died with such a frightening ability. That senior must’ve felt really frustrated.’\nEven while he sympathized with his senior, he squashed the slimes without pause with both arms. The more he repeated unarmed combat, the more his body adapted to it, and despite his physical abilities not changing, he became able to move more nimbly. Naturally, his speed in hunting monsters also increased.\nHe was aware that he was hunting monsters much faster than before he had Bursting Thunder. Perhaps using this skill, which included barehanded combat, with various weapons, as well as various combat methods caused it to grow.\n[You have acquired 12 Perium.]\n[You have acquired 12 Perium.]\n[You have acquired 12 Perium.]\n[You have acquired a deteriorated Skeleton Soldier’s arm bone.]\nWhen about 30 minutes had passed since being overwhelmed, the wave of slimes had lessened, and Lee Shin Woo was able to see again. Even while hectically hitting the slimes, he stealthily surveyed his surroundings.\n\"Hoo, then how much... Ha. Haha.\"\nWhen he looked at the surrounding environment, he couldn’t help but laugh. He had come into the dungeon full of hope and roughly an hour had passed, yet he was still at the dungeon’s entrance. Even though he killed so many slimes!\nThere were truly an outrageous number of monsters here, such that it was incomparable to the dungeons he had gone through before. If he combined the number of monsters he’d killed since coming to this world, it would probably still be less than the number he’d killed in this dungeon alone!\n\"This place is seriously no joke. Seriously...\"\n[Gureureureuk]\n[Ggoreureuk!]\nHe shook his head and as if they were matching the rhythm of the muttering skeleton, the slimes cried out and attacked him. Rather than respond, he went with a precise one-two punch, cleanly squashed them, and grinned. He was satisfied that he had the proper form now, even barehanded.\n[You have acquired 12 Perium.]\n[You have acquired 12 Perium.]\n’Then... then shall we wipe them all out?’\nStarting from that moment, Lee Shin Woo stopped being concerned about time, and only thought about squashing his opponents with Bursting Thunder, and healing himself with Regeneration. He’d be the only one getting tired from counting the time.\n[Gureureureureuk!]\n[Ggureuk!]\n[The Slime’s weak Acid Poison is melting your body.]\n[Beginner Regeneration has become Lv9.]\nCompared to the Giant Zombie’s Acid Poison that he’d been exposed to very briefly, the slimes’ just itched, and because he kept using Regeneration continuously, he became unable to even feel the pain.\nNow, the poison that the slimes emitted was like... yeah, it felt like a light sprinkling of rain, and made his bones feel a little better. If the other heroes knew what he was thinking, they would’ve clicked their tongues, pitying the newbie that had gone insane in an extreme situation.\n[Ggureureuk!]\n[Gguuah!]\n[Kureuk!]\nAs he continued to extend his fists towards the unending waves of slimes, he eventually stopped thinking entirely.\nIt was certainly different from what’s often called the elimination of the self, but after fighting while leaving his body to his instincts, his unnecessary, idle thoughts disappeared, and he only moved with the goal of destroying his enemies quickly and precisely. As he did so, his proficiency naturally had no choice but to rise rapidly.\nHe wondered how much time had passed? Lee Shin Woo only perceived the crisp trajectory of his fists. It felt as if he were executing the attack that only seemed possible within his mind. The bodies of the exploded slimes were everywhere, acting as proof of that result.\n[Low Rank Bursting Thunder has become Lv4. Strength, Agility, and Magic increase by 2. It has become easier for you to handle a weapon, even if you have never wielded it before. The rate at which proficiency increases for combat related skills has increased.]\nIt was a splendid achievement that was incomparable to the growth of the Regeneration skill. Bursting Thunder, which was at the center of all his skills, wouldn’t rise in proficiency before; yet, in only four days after getting to level 3, it had risen to level 4!\nHis stats had naturally increased, and the power of the skill had also increased dramatically. Now, the slimes that hadn’t sustained a direct hit were affected, as a portion of their bodies burst. Lee Shin Woo smiled faintly and started to move even faster.\n[You have acquired 12 Perium.]\n[You have acquired 12 Perium.]\n\"Nothing, again... Hm?\"\nBut after he had cleaned up a clump of slimes in the blink of an eye, there was a bone in the center of them that caught his eye. Lee Shin Woo grabbed it and immediately used Bone Reinforcement. Then...\n[You have consumed a deteriorated Poison Zombie’s finger bone to reinforce your finger bones. Magic has increased by 1. Absorbing a portion of the Poison Zombie’s memories and experiences.]\n[Guwahk... Poison, even with my poison...! - Nameless Poison Zombie]\n\"Huh?\"\nThe moment he absorbed the experiences and memories within, he felt like something was different. It was definitely a memory of a zombie dying to a slime, but a countless number of slimes had attacked in order to kill this zombie.\nMoreover, the zombie resisted until the bitter end. Whether a Poison Zombie’s defense was high, or its level was high, he was, at the very least, sure that the Poison Zombie had met a heroic end, compared to the other monsters. Read complete versıon only at NoveI~Fire.net\n[Gureuk]\nThen, a rude slime stuck onto his back and sprayed its Acid Poison. The moment Lee Shin Woo went to strike it with his hand, a brief message appeared before him.\n[You have learned Beginner Acid Resistance Lv1. You have become able to, albeit weakly, resist Acid Poison.]\n[Resistance has been added to your status.]\n\"Huh...!?\"\nSo that’s how it was. The skill that he could obtain from the bones was none other than Acid Resistance! Now everything had become clear. Lee Shin Woo exclaimed, filled with both awe and realization.\n\"Damn it, now I can’t train my Regeneration skill!\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 5. Trickster’s Karma - 4>\nLee Shin Woo supposed that the saying was true; misfortune and fortune come hand in hand.\n[Beginner Acid Resistance has become Lv4. Resistance increases.]\n\"...\"\nHis newly acquired skill, Acid Resistance, was truly amazing. Even though it was just at the Beginner stage, it blocked half the damage from the slimes’ Acid Poison. Moreover, in the process, the skill proficiency increases as well!\nBut because half of the damage is blocked, there was a noticeable drop in the growth rate of his Regeneration skill proficiency. He had hoped that he’d be able to get the now level 9 Beginner Regeneration skill to the low rank level!\n[Ggureureureuk!]\n[Ggreureuk!]\n[The slimes sprayed their weak Acid Poison, but Acid Resistance reduces the damage.]\n\"Hoo... it can’t be helped. I have no choice but to use the rest of my mana.\"\nLee Shin Woo, who was fine even after being covered by the slimes, checked his body and conclude that he’d be fine for about 10 minutes without using his Regeneration skill. Then, he thought about what he would do with his remaining mana. Since he had realized how important skills were, he had already made up his mind to train his skills as much as possible.\n’The Shriek of the Dead is... No, if these guys fight amongst themselves, I won’t be able to train my Regeneration and Acid Resistance. The Power Slash... isn’t possible since I’d need a weapon.’\nHe realised all that was left was either Catapult, or Flames of Revenge, and thought about which one he should train; he soon made up his mind to train Flames of Revenge.\nThe reason was extremely simple. Catapult just launched a bone at an enemy, but conversely, if he trained Flames of Revenge, it would be usable in various areas.\n’I can shoot it from a far distance and I can put it on my weapon. It also has a pursuit function, and does persistent damage... In other words, just by training this, my overall power will increase.’\nBut this skill’s output wasn’t satisfactory for the amount of mana used, so he hadn’t had an opportunity to actively use it. The fact that it was only a beginner level 3 skill was proof of that.\nThe Treasure Eater had created such an enormous flame though... Perhaps it could be due to the disparity between their magic, or it could be because something changed as it was modified from Flames of Resentment to Flames of Revenge.\n’In any case, the higher the level, the more effective it should be. Let’s train the skill to at least see if that’s true.’\nSince he had acquired the Acid Resistance skill, the burden to his mana had reduced significantly; right now, it was absolutely possible for him to simultaneously train his Flames of Revenge. Even though it was against his will, damn it!\n\"Kuuu...\"\nHe definitely wanted to raise his Resistance skill to the low rank level, but... Lee Shin Woo made an expression as though he was going to cry (though of course, there wasn’t any change whatsoever on the outside), and created flames.\nThe slimes that violently attached themselves to him seemed to also be intimidated by the mass of black flames floating in the air, and were melted by the flames; their bodies shrunk gradually and soon, emitted a sound of gas leaking and were completely destroyed. Since they had died so quickly, he hadn’t used much mana.\n[You have acquired 12 Perium.]\n[You have acquired 12 Perium.]\n[You have acquired 12 Perium.]\n[You have acquired a Slime’s Core.]\n\"Huh!?\"\nHowever, there was an even more surprising reward. He had killed hundreds of slimes thus far, and it might’ve even reached the thousands, yet a reward he hadn’t seen before had suddenly popped out!\n\"What is this...\"\nAll he was sure about was that it wasn’t a common item! Lee Shin Woo collected the Slime’s Core that emitted a dark light before the other slimes could eat it. At that moment, something happened.\n[Through Bone Reinforcement, the monster’s essence is being changed.]\n[The Slime’s Core has become the Slime Bone Core.]\n’Huh...!?’\nHe was even more surprised than when he had first picked up the Slime’s Core. He thought that Bone Reinforcement was only applicable to equipment, yet to think it worked on other items as well! No matter how he thought about it, the Slime’s Core didn’t seem similar to equipment.\nIf that’s the case, then how...? Lee Shin Woo stood still, and even if the slimes swarmed him, he didn’t concern himself with them and checked the item’s information.\n[Slime Bone Core]\n[A Slime is sensitive to fire. Although normal slimes just spread their mana across their bodies, if you encounter them and their bodies melt, their mana gathers in their body. If you hunt the Slimes in this situation, you will occasionally receive a core filled with their condensed mana.]\n[It can be processed into equipment that contains the monster’s power, or it can be processed into a medicine that permanently increases your physical abilities. By changing the cores into bone, those special characteristics and rarity are decidedly higher than normal cores.]\n’Oh, Oooooooh...!’\nIt was nothing but dumb luck, but he felt really good. He felt like he couldn’t receive anything from the slimes besides deteriorated bones and Perium, but to think there was this kind of twist waiting for him!\nHe could roughly guess why the core had changed into bone when he read the item explanation. Didn’t it say a monster’s core could be used as a material for equipment or potions? Just like how normal equipment is changed into bone, the cores that could be used as materials for equipment and potions are also naturally affected by Bone Reinforcement.\n’It’s turned out well. I won’t be able to intake a skeleton’s core with a normal method anyway.’\nHe didn’t hide his excitement and used the Slime Bone Core as the target of Bone Reinforcement. Then, the message appeared.\n[The Slime Bone Core works on the entire body. Would you like to proceed with Bone Reinforcement?]\n\"Yeah.\"\n[Reinforcing the entire body. Magic has increased by 1. Acquiring a portion of the Slime’s memories and experiences.]\n[Gureureuk! Reureureureureu! - Slime]\nHe probably wouldn’t raise his magic by 1 every time he took in a core, so he had to see it as being lucky this time. Still, just the fact that he could intake cores in order to acquire magic was great. Since he had trained his skills, his magic had increased by a lot, but compared to his other stats, it was still lower.\nHowever, if he did well in this dungeon, it’s possible that his magic could become higher than his other stats!\n\"Now, then...\"\nIt was important starting now. Of course, it’d be great if he were able to burn all the slimes inhabiting the sewers and acquire their cores, but unfortunately, his mana was finite, and he needed mana to use his Regeneration skill to safeguard his body from their Acid Poison.\nSo from now on, he would measure out enough of his remaining mana for his Regeneration and Acid Resistance skills, and would appropriately use his Flames of Revenge when he could; he would simultaneously train the Flames of Revenge and acquire as many slime cores as possible.\n[Gureureureuk!]\n[Ggureureuk!]\n\"Yeah, yeah, let’s play a lot, Pudding.\"\nHow satisfied could he have been with the Slime’s Cores for him to have given the slimes a nickname!? Lee Shin Woo took a deep breath and used his remaining mana, excluding an amount reserved for his Regeneration skill... and used his Flames of Revenge again. Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on n͟o͟v͟e͟l͟f͟i͟r͟e͟.net\n\"You like playing with fire, don’t you, Pudding?\"\n[Ggureureuk!]\nA countless number of Puddings... of slimes quivered intensely and were greeted by fire. Lee Shin Woo saw that and laughed pleasingly as they burned. Just like a demon.\n\"Yeah, yeah, eat a lot.\"\nThey probably didn’t understand what he was saying, and the slimes still trembled even more intensely. Lee Shin Woo laughed with a ’ha-ha’ and threw his fist, popping the slimes in the center that couldn’t bear the flames with their own mana.\n[You have hunted a Lv1 Sewer Slime.]\n[You have hunted a Lv1 Sewer...]\nIt probably wouldn’t be perfect, but after repeatedly going through trial and error, and fine tuning his stamina and magic, he was confident that he could completely turn this into a training environment.\nAnd it was truthfully proceeding like that. Was it because he started properly? Or maybe because his mana senses were particularly sharp.\n[Low Rank Magic Affinity has become Lv2. Magic increases by 2.]\nHis Magic Affinity skill, which had been reborn into a low rank skill, had finally risen to level 2 since entering this dungeon. His mana Regeneration was now faster, his Flames of Revenge naturally became more effective, he could use it more, and as a result, the proficiency rose.\nMoreover, he was proceeding at a slower pace than before, but his Regeneration still rose. Whenever his Acid Resistance blocked the slime’s Acid Poison and whenever he absorbed the deteriorated bones that popped out, he quickly grew. This dungeon was truly an immeasurably valuable treasure house for him.\n’If I find a senior that I like, I should teach them about this place. That they definitely have to enter a Sewers Dungeon if there’s one nearby...’\nAs he committed to his horrific plan, which would push someone he liked into hell and was something a human being wouldn’t be able to think of, he gradually crawled further into the dungeon.\nThe Sewers was so vast that it covered this small town, and was wider and deeper than any dungeon he had learned about; obviously, there were heaps of slimes, piled up like mountains.\nIt was when five days had passed. He suddenly thought he felt the flow of mana; it’d been a long time since he saw a lengthy message in front of him.\n[You returned to your wild instincts and have achieved astonishing hunting results. Strength, Agility, and Health have increased by 2. You have acquired the Barbarian’s token. Proficiency in Low Rank Bursting Thunder and Beginner Flames of Revenge increases.]\n[Beginner Flames of Revenge has become Lv7.]\n\"Hm?\"\nLee Shin Woo, who was cleaving through the slimes with motions his body was now familiar with, and using his remaining mana to create flames, repeatedly burning the slimes (unfortunately, even though he burned the slimes, their core drop rate was low), was flustered at the sudden message.\n’Barbarian’s token? What barbarian?’\nHe had completely given up on going through this dungeon with a concept this time, yet he had suddenly achieved a feat and even received a token! He smashed the remaining slimes in the passageway and immediately took out the new token from his inventory.\n[Barbarian’s token]\n[A karma that suits those who fight only with their bare body, without relying on weapons, armor or refined techniques. There is occasionally one amongst them that can harness the power of nature, and if this strength is used to its extreme, they will go beyond a Barbarian and awaken a Druid’s abilities.]\n\"...\"\nAfter entering the dungeon, he killed the slimes using only his bare body, without swinging a weapon, and even used fire; is that why he got this token?\nWhen he thought about it like that, Lee Shin Woo honestly couldn’t feel happy about it. It felt peculiar like when he had received the Mastermind token or the Avenger token.\n’Still, karma is karma, so...’\nMoreover, since it was a karma he could only receive by hunting for a long time naked, considerable intellectuals wouldn’t even be able to peek a glance at it.\nLee Shin Woo’s (nonexistent) heart ached when he thought about it seriously, so he stopped thinking about it. In any case, he now had a total of seven tokens. If he just got three more, he would be able to achieve the Trickster’s karma.\n’At first, I thought it would take me forever to gather 10 tokens, but I just need to get three more of them like this.’\nOf course, it would probably be best to get more skills and attempt a new concept. Like the Druid... Lee Shin Woo promised to remember the term ’Druid’ for now, and raised his head. Now that he thought about it, why hadn’t the slimes attacked him, when they hadn’t left him alone before?\nThe path was ending.\nThere was a circular iron gate situated at the end of the path.",

    "content": "<Chapter 5. Trickster’s Karma - 5>\n\"Is it the... boss room?\"\nThe sewers dungeon he had entered had quite a simple structure. Though it thoroughly had roads that split off, other than the small waterway that organisms couldn’t go in or out of, there were only a few wide passageways, so he could just thoughtlessly kill the slimes and follow the path.And at the end of this path was this. He had a suspicion that the passageways were gradually merging into one, and it turned out it was all because of the boss room.\n’There’s probably no reason to hesitate at this point.’\nIt did seem like he had killed all the slimes, and he didn’t have a reason to turn back without killing the boss.But he hadn’t felt danger from an enemy even once in this dungeon, and he was a bit exhausted, so if he were to fight the boss in this state, he might lose one of his precious lives, so before fighting the boss, Lee Shin Woo yelled out to refocus himself.\n’I need to put on my equipment too.’\nHe hadn’t worn his equipment for the past five days, so it felt a bit awkward. Lee Shin Woo wore the Dire Wolf Bone Armor, confirmed that his health had indeed increased, and raised the Bone of Thunder Lasting in his hand. This time, his strength and magic increased. When he checked his status in this state...\n[Lee Shin Woo][Skeleton Avenger Blessed by God][Treasure Hunter][Lv - 2 (Status Effectiveness 110%)[Strength - 98 + 16 Agility - 95 + 10 Health - 95 + 30 Magic - 102 + 15] (While dungeon bonuses are being applied)[Passive skills - Invisible Heart Lv3, Acting Lv4, Beginner Avenger Lv1, Low Rank Bursting Thunder Lv4, Low Rank Magic Affinity Lv2, Low Rank Stealth Lv3, Beginner Command Lv3][Active skills - Bone Reinforcement Lv3, Low Rank Sprint Lv2, Beginner Shriek of the Dead Lv9, Beginner Regeneration Lv9, Beginner Catapult Lv8, Beginner Flames of Revenge Lv7, Beginner Power Slash Lv5][Resistance - Acid - Beginner Lv9]\nThere wasn’t much change in his strength, agility, or health. At most, his skills leveled up, or his stats increased slightly as an additional effect of receiving a portion of the Barbarian’s karma. However, the change in his magic was huge.He trained his Low Rank Magic Affinity, and reinforced himself with the slime bone cores he occasionally acquired; as a result, his stat which had, funnily enough, been the lowest, was the stat that exceeded 100 first! Because of that, his stats reached a total of 390. If he raised his stats by 10, he would reach a total of 400, and would soon reach level 3.\n’If we add in the bonus, I’m already level 3.’\nIt happened when he saw the equipment’s effects, as well as the dungeons bonus on his stats. He thought he needed to be really focused, yet when he saw his persistently increasing stats, he couldn’t stop the rushing feeling that he didn’t need to be afraid of anything.\n’No, I can’t do that.’\nLee Shin Woo hit his cheek. It was annoying that he didn’t even hear a slapping sound but instead heard a stiff sound, but he was able to get a hold of himself.\n\"Hoo... Alright.\"\nHis preparations were perfect. His health and mana were full, and his combat senses were well polished, unlike before. His Acid Resistance had also increased sharply due to his body resisting so much acid. Lee Shin Woo approached the circular iron gate after exhaling a deep breath. And daringly opened the door.\n[Guooooh...]\nThere was a really huge clearing within, and a really big slime filled about a third of the clearing. ...A really big slime.\n[Lv3 Great Slime]\n[Guooh?]\"...\"\nAll of his concerns until now had been pointless. The moment he saw it, his abundant confidence disappeared into the ground. Despite sufficiently preparing for the boss fight, he hadn’t imagined that this kind of situation would be awaiting him. Why the hell did a level 1 dungeon have a level 3 boss?\n[Guooh...!]\nHowever, he didn’t have time to spare quibbling over why. That’s because the Great Slime noticed him, lightly sprung up from its position with its chubby body, and... with an astonishing speed, rushed towards him!\n[Guoooh!]\n\"You asshole, that’s cheating!\"\n’Would it just rush over like that?’ is what he stupidly thought and survived as a result. He instinctually used his Sprint and was able to avoid its attack.Instead of hitting Lee Shin Woo, the Great Slime collided with the iron gate, forcibly closing it due to impact, and making this place a secret room.\n’Huh?’\nLee Shin Woo saw that and momentarily felt like something was strange, but that didn’t continue for very long. Since it was already too much just to be completely focused on this fight!\n[Guoooh!]\"Ugh!\"\nIt seemed like it wasn’t very hurt even after hitting the wall as it once again bounced in place and rushed towards him. Like it was proving that it was level 3, it rushed at him with an absurd speed he hadn’t yet experienced before!\n\"Uaah!\"\nTo think that a skeleton was dodging a slime bouncing in place; someone observing from the outside would think of this as an extremely comical scene, but honestly, Lee Shin Woo, who was facing the slime, felt like he was a soldier that came across a clump of rock launched from a catapult.\n\"Tch!\"[Guooh!]\nThe trajectory of its charge was really simple, so as long he grasped its charge beforehand, it wasn’t actually that hard to dodge it. However, he couldn’t just dodge like this forever. Lee Shin Woo really didn’t like this situation. It made him think of when he was in high school, competing in dodgeball, and him being the only one remaining in the ring.\n[Guoooooooh!]\nHe would’ve rather gotten hit quickly and gone out, but just getting hit on purpose was kind of awkward, so he had run around hectically; it felt really miserable back then!Remembering that, spite welled up in his (nonexistent) eyes. This was revenge time. He would inflict his past revenge on this guy instead! Certain individuals might say that he was accusing the wrong person or passing the blame, but he wasn’t concerned with that.\n’Flames of Revenge.’\nAs he dodged its fourth charge, he manifested a mass of black flames atop one of his hands. If he did as he wanted, he would’ve fought by putting the flames on his weapon, but if he clashed straight up with the slime, which was continuously charging without pause, his weapon or his body would be crushed, so it was impossible.\n[Guooh!]\nLee Shin Woo rolled his body, and even as his body got wet from the dirty underground water, he once again dodged the Great Slime’s charge. It once again hit the wall, creating a tremendous noise. And for a brief instant, it didn’t move.\n’Now!’\nLee Shin Woo, who had been waiting for that opportunity, swiftly blew the black flames forwards, hitting the mark. It had a homing ability, so the accompanying flames accurately hit the Great Slime’s body, started draining his mana from far away, and began to burn lively.\n[Guoooooooh!]\nIts response was truly fierce. Slimes’ common weakness was fire, and it going completely up in flames in real time was proof of that! It rubbed itself in the dirty water in an attempt to extinguish the fire, but it wouldn’t be called the Flames of Revenge if it were that easy to extinguish.\n[Gugeugeugeugeugeugeuk!]\"Wow, you sure burn well.\"\nThis moment was the most fulfilling moment in his life. It would’ve been nice if he could’ve also burned those bastards that had only aimed for him in dodgeball like that!\n[Gooooguaaah!]\nBut that leisurely thought only lasted for a moment. The intensity of the flames gradually expanded, and when its body was engulfed and burning, the Great Slime seemed to shake... and instantly erupted in a grand explosion!\n\"What!?\"\nAfter the fire had attached to it, it had disassembled a portion of its body into pieces and erupted everywhere! It was like a missile that had slammed into the ground and exploded. Since there was nowhere to dodge, he just hurriedly curled up his body and protected his head.\n\"Ugh, urgh...!\"\nIn a split second, he curled himself in a ball and the Great Slime shot out fragments of itself like shells, flying towards him and pummeling him. It hurt immensely. Each of those fragments contained a devastating acid within, and he felt his arms and legs, as well as various parts of his body being perforated in real time.\n[Gooooooh!]\nAt that moment, the Great Slime shrieked once more. Lee Shin Woo was sure that it was a sign that the Great Slime was going to charge, and he grit his teeth and rolled onto the floor, even though his body was full of holes. As expected, immediately after, he could hear the sound of the wind being split terrifyingly, and the Great Slime grazed past him and hit the ground with a thud. Its collision emitted a sound akin to an explosion!\n’Regeneration!’\nSince it came to this, he couldn’t afford to conserve his mana. Lee Shin Woo hurriedly stood up, recovered his body through regeneration, and secured a clear view. In the process of tearing its body apart for the suicidal explosion, it had definitely gotten a lot smaller.\n[Lv3 Great Slime]\n’The level’s still the same even though it’s a lot smaller now... The magic within its body seems to be the same, too.’\nThe Great Slime, by exploding a portion of its body, had managed to extinguish the fire that would never go out unless its target was dead. Due to that, its body had gotten smaller, but the magic was focused and condensed within its body, so its strength hadn’t lessened one bit. On the contrary, although its stats were the same, due to its smaller size, it seemed to be even faster!\n[Guoooh!]\"Eeeek...!\"\nHowever, despite the situation taking a turn for the worse, he was sure that his method of attacking was correct. If he were to nitpick over its natural abilities, it was a monster that far surpassed the Treasure Eater. He couldn’t even imagine taking it head on, so he needed to reduce its size this way.\n’I’ll burn its body using the Flames of Revenge, causing it to shake it off by using its suicidal explosion. I’ll recover the damage I take from its explosion, and in the process, the slime’s charge will gradually become faster. I’ll dodge its charge and then hit it once again with my Flames of Revenge. ...Yeah, it’s perfect. It’s a perfect nightmare.’\nAs he repeatedly trained in this dungeon, he had certainly grown in stats, skills, and experience; yet he felt frustrated that he still had to struggle against the boss.However, truthfully, it was the opposite. Because he did his best to train and went through the motions to learn his skills through firsthand experience, he was able fight this monster 1 on 1. If he hadn’t thought of training his Flames of Revenge, no, if he hadn’t thought of immediately becoming familiar with his Regeneration skill, he wouldn’t have even stood a chance in this battle.\n\"Sseup, there’s no helping it...\"\nLee Shin Woo, with the feeling that he was a newtype[1] relying on his machine to plunge into the atmosphere, formed his Flames of Revenge. He didn’t know if his health and magic would endure until the end of this battle, but he had no choice but to try it right now.\n[Guuuuu...oooh!]\"Ha!\"\nIt was preparing its charge again, but no matter how fast it was, the fact that its route was simple didn’t change. Lee Shin Woo had also become familiar with it, so the instant it charged, he used his Sprint and avoided it; simultaneously, he successfully hit it with his Flames of Revenge.\n[Gureureureu!]\"It’s coming...!\"\nIt bounced so quickly that it wasn’t aware of the incoming fire and was struck by a direct hit. It hit the wall, its body rolled, and then... when it realized that its body was on fire, it rampaged about like last time, and exploded for the second time!However, just as Lee Shin Woo had prepared beforehand, he protected his head, and the instant he took damage, he withdrew the stockpiled materials in his inventory and used Bone Reinforcement, healing his wounds. The most update n0vels are published on novel•ﬁre.net\n’I have to use Flames of Revenge again, so I have to endure by using the bones in my inventory for now.’\nThough his Low Rank Magic Affinity had grown, it was still low rank, and despite how much higher his magic had gotten, he was ultimately still level 2. He couldn’t endlessly utilize both his Flames of Revenge and Regeneration at the same time.Although Lee Shin Woo possessed an ability that allowed him to face his opponent, he lamented that he was unable to use it as much as he wanted, and moved unceasingly. He would survive this battle no matter what, and next time, he would be a bit stronger.\n[Guoooooooh!]\"Yes, yes, you damn Pudding. Let’s play some more...!\"\nLee Shin Woo grit his teeth, muttered, and used Sprint. Immediately after, the Great Slime, which had lessened in size again, slammed into the spot he was just in. As expected, it was gradually becoming faster and faster. ... It seemed that his Sprint skill, which he had neglected in this dungeon, would get some good training in the end.\n[1] T/N: Mobile Suit Gundam reference.

    "content": "<Chapter 6. Level 3 - 1>\n[Low Rank Sprint has become Lv3.]\n[Beginner Acid Resistance has evolved to the low rank level. You can resist acid more effectively, and acid resistance is also given to your equipment.]\nHow long would he have to roll around in the clearing filled with dirty water? Lee Shin Woo honestly felt thankful that he was a skeleton with unlimited stamina. Even if his stats were the same, he would’ve run out of energy already if he were a human, and been squashed.\n\"Tch, you’re still trying?\"\n[Gureureureu...!]\nAs a result of it self-destructing in an attempt to shake off the Flames of Revenge, the Great Slime had reduced to the size of a normal slime. It did increase its speed significantly, but the problem was that it hadn’t gotten used to its smaller size, so its charge attacks’ accuracy had dropped.\n[Gureureureuk!]\n\"Umhp.\" (let’s see)\nLee Shin Woo avoided its attack, as he had gotten used to its movements. It slammed into the opposite wall, and completely destroyed the surface of the wall. The force behind its charge had certainly become tremendous, but he could now close his eyes and still dodge its attack.\n\"My magic is slowly reaching its limit. Let’s finish this.\"\n[Gureuk...!]\nIf it wasn’t for the bones stockpiled in his inventory, it would’ve been impossible to endure until now. He had completely used them up, and squeezed out the mana to use his Regeneration skill. All in order to endure.\nWhat’s worse, he hadn’t been able to repair a portion of his rib bones as they remained damaged until now. His armor was also worse for wear. He was already in this situation by the time his Acid Resistance had risen to low rank and he could imbue it to his armor.\nHowever, the important thing was that he hadn’t died yet and endured.\n’Flames of Revenge.’\nHe thought about pouring all of his mana into the flames, but desperately controlled the urge, only instilling about half of his mana into the flames. He had left enough mana to utilize Regeneration, or the Flames of Revenge just one more time. If it didn’t die after taking two shots, then he’d really have to die and come back to life.\n[Low Rank Magic Affinity has become Lv3. Magic has increased by 2. Your magic will have a greater effect with a lower amount of mana.]\nThe skill level had increased by a lot, but as he fought various battles within this dungeon, he felt as though he had taken a step into the domain of detailed mana control that couldn’t be explained simply by skill level.\nThere probably weren’t many amongst the senior heroes that could manipulate mana as delicately as he could, so he could say that he was truly amazing. Though he himself didn’t actually know that.\n[Gureureureureureureu!]\nThe Great Slime roared. It had realized that the flames that Lee Shin Woo used weren’t normal.\nIt became aware that the next time those flames touched it, it would die, and tried to avoid the flames at all cost. It started to quickly bounce around everywhere, to the point that if one were to witness it, they would get motion sickness.\n\"Ha!\"\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo launched his Flames of Revenge without even properly aiming it. Since its size had lessened significantly, the slime seemed to think that it could somehow avoid the flames, but from the start, the Flames of Revenge was a technique that couldn’t be avoided!\n[Ggureureureuk!]\nAs expected, the Flames of Revenge, neither quickly nor slowly, proceeded through the clearing and accurately struck the Great Slime’s body. And because Lee Shin Woo made use of the wind, the slime went up in flames. The flames burned slowly when its body was still huge, but now, its entire body was engulfed instantly.\n[Kik... Kihik...]\nAt that moment, he heard a sound that he hadn’t heard before from the slime. Lee Shin Woo prepared for its self-destruct, and curled his body up again, but no matter how long he waited, it didn’t explode. Instead, this message appeared in front of him.\n[You have hunted a Lv3 Great Slime.]\n[You have achieved the feat of defeating an elite monster that was a higher level than you by only using fire. Magic has increased by 5. You have acquired the ’Four Elements: Fire’ token. Beginner Flames of Revenge has reached level 10, and evolved into the low rank level. You can create stronger flames with less mana, and you can imbue not only your weapons, but also your body with fire.]\nHe opened his (nonexistent) eyes wide. It was already astonishing that he had gotten his second token in this dungeon alone, but the fact that this message appeared meant...\nLee Shin Woo carefully raised his head. There was no explosion, and there definitely wasn’t a charge coming. Through the Great Slime’s rampage, various parts of the clearing had collapsed, and he saw a sphere radiating light in the center. It was a core!\n\"Ha...\"\nLee Shin Woo saw that and a lengthy sigh escaped his mouth. It was such a lengthy and intense battle that he couldn’t easily get the feeling that it was over, despite it definitely being over. It kind of felt like the day he was discharged from the army. The battle had felt that long to him.\n\"But I still won.\"\nHe couldn’t give himself lip service and say he won due to his skill. Rather than needing his polished combat skills, he was just busy running away and shooting out flames. If this were a novel, the readers would say ’what kind of development is this?’ and criticize it.\nHowever, he won. Regardless of the means necessary, he won. He won without dying. That was enough for him. He was as happy as he could be.\nHe won, so it was now time to collect the loot. Lee Shin Woo moved his creaking body and walked over to where the Great Slime lay dead. There were four things there. Perium, the Great Slime’s core, someone’s deteriorated bone, and finally, a large shield.\n[You have acquired 11,210 Perium.]\n[You have acquired the Great Slime’s Bone Core.]\n[You have acquired a deteriorated Skeleton Shielder’s shoulder bone.]\n[You have acquired a Lv2 Bone Tower Shield (+5).]\n’If this goes well, I won’t even need to go the shop to level up...’\nDue to his achievement, his stats had risen to a total of 396. He didn’t have a way to tell what level monster the Skeleton Shielder was, but if he included this, and the Great Slime’s Bone Core, it felt like he’d be able to raise his stats by at least 4.\n\"Hoo...\"\nFor starters, he collected the Perium. He checked his inventory and saw that he had collected 71,130 Perium after this last deposit. He was truly deeply moved. It only seemed like a couple days ago that he was pondering which bone he should pick which cost a little more than 3,000 Perium, yet to think he had gathered a sum of 70,000 Perium already...!\nHe looked at his inventory and after nodding his head a few times, moved on to his next task. That was to put all his equipment into his inventory.\n’When I got to level 2, Bone Reinforcement had absorbed all of my equipment as well. Since there’s a high likelihood of that happening again...’\nOf course, at the same time, the Bone Reinforcement’s effects had been truly amazing. It would retain the abilities of the weapons, no, it could increase those abilities during the absorption. However... even if he obtained the abilities his equipment had, the defensive capabilities, as well as their attack power aren’t retained.\nSince the Bone of Thunder Lasting and the Dire Wolf Bone Armor were items that possessed outstanding attack power and defensive capabilities, it would be a complete waste to sacrifice them in order to gain some stats. So, he needed to prepare before leveling up.\n’And.’\nHe actually removed the other items from his inventory, besides the Bone of Thunder Lasting, and the Dire Wolf Armor; this included the shield he had just acquired. They were all level 1 or level 2 equipment, and they were items he received as rewards from the dungeons.\nSince both his weapon and armor were level 3, he thought the reinforcement would fail with this equipment, so he had stored them all. And if he were to aim for the right time for Bone Reinforcement with this equipment, he ascertained that that time was now: when he leveled up. He was starting to get the know-how of how this worked.\n\"Hoo, then shall we start?\"\nAfter he piled up the equipment right beside him, he inspected them with delighted eyes and raised the deteriorated Skeleton Shielder’s shoulder bone in his hand.\n\"Bone Reinforcement.\"\n[You have reinforced your shoulder bone. Health has increased by 3. Absorbing a portion of the Skeleton Shielder’s memories and experiences.]\n[Kukek, this warped, cursed body will ultimately be buried here... General, please forgive me for not being able to return to your side... - Hiles Keller]\nWho the hell are you!? Why the hell are you saying something so profound!? No, and if we’re talking about a general here, is it Seagald or Leofield? If not, is it a new, third general!? Why are all the generals here so popular!?\n\"Damn it, I’ll remember the name ’Hiles Keller’...\"\nHe only wanted to improve his abilities, but why is this subplot constantly being attached? His curiosity naturally increased, but Lee Shin Woo decided to ignore it for now. More importantly, his stats now totaled 399 through Bone Reinforcement.\n\"I’m so scared that I’m shaking.\"\nLee Shin Woo checked once again that his equipment was safely inside his inventory and cautiously grabbed the Great Slime’s Bone Core. He gripped it in one hand, sighed once again, and... initiated the Reinforcement.\n[The Great Slime’s Bone Core reinforces your entire body. Magic has increased by 17. Acquiring a portion of the Great Slime’s memories and experiences.]\n[Guoooooooooh! Kugeugeugeugeugagagagagaga! - Great Slime]\n\"...\"\nThe Great Slime’s extremely clear memories passed through his brain. Its first memory was the moment its entire body was burning, going completely crazy, and self-destructing.\n\"It shouldn’t be, right...?\"\nHe was worried with the Rat Queen that he’d get a skill based on birthing, but since he had acquired the Regeneration skill as a result, it should be like that this time as well. It had to.\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo muttered to himself, trying to get himself to accept it, a dark magic hung over him, as though it had been waiting for this moment.\n[It is time for you to receive the karma you were endowed.]\n[The Lv2 Bone Tower Shield (+5), as well as the other 13 bone equipment were consumed all at the same time, and Bone Reinforcement has been executed. The effects of the equipment a lower level than you are halved.]\n\"Ugh...!\"\nIt went as expected. He didn’t know how, but the moment he leveled up, all the bone equipment in his periphery were drawn to him and Bone Reinforcement was initiated! Perhaps this was why Bone Reinforcement possessed a modification ability; perhaps it was for this very moment...!\nThe equipment flew and changed into small particles. The instant those particles were absorbed, he felt a strong power rising throughout his body, as well as a sign that something was changing. Lee Shin Woo suddenly thought.\n’Perhaps... the ultimate goal of Bone Reinforcement is to integrate the strength of the bones, as well as the bone equipment into my body as one.’\nOf course, it was still impossible to make a deduction. Did he have to try Reinforcing bone equipment with other bone equipment, or should he try to reinforce his own bones? It was still a problem that he needed to solve.\nHe couldn’t say which exactly was more effective yet. From now on, this was a problem he’d have to look into, possibly for quite a long time.\nBut right now, the only thing he was sure about was that he still needed the assistance of powerful equipment.\n[Strength has increased by 11, Agility by 9, Health by 13, and Magic by 12. You have learned the active skill, Low Rank Harden Lv1.]\n[The Bone Reinforcement skill has become Lv4. You can now target others and use your Bone Reinforcement on them.]\nEven while he seriously considered his Bone Reinforcement and the direction of his growth, the change proceeded quickly. All the potential strength within the equipment was extracted and as a result, his stats were reinforced beyond his wildest imagination; in the process of leveling up, his bones thickened once again and became even more durable.\nHis height increased considerably and became close to 1 meter and 90 cm. His bones were even more saturated with darkness and anyone that saw him would say that his bones were black. And once the acquired memories and experiences were collected and organized, they bore fruit.\n[Low Rank Sprint has changed into the Combat Sprint skill. The level remains the same. In exchange for the skill duration shortening, when it is used in tandem with a attack skill, the attack is amplified. Agility has increased by 5.]\n[You have acquired the active skill, Low Rank Self-Destruct Lv1. By exploding a section, or even your entire body, you inflict tremendous damage to all your enemies in the surrounding area. You also take a significant amount of damage. Health and Magic have increased by 3.]\nCombat Sprint was probably an ability that the shielder had. It had changed in a way that better suited him, so it couldn’t get any better than this.\nMore importantly, contrary to Regeneration, he hadn’t been saved from receiving the Self-Destruct skill... Lee Shin Woo decided to think about this later. After all, there was something much more important that he had to do right now. A change much greater than any skill... a level up.\n[You have become level 3. The effectiveness of your stats increases. Your proficiency in combat related skills, with the addition of a bonus, increases. The boxes in your inventory increase by 20.]\n[Due to the feats you have achieved, your species changes. You have become a Dark Skeleton. You are more aggressive and handle magic superbly, but you are extremely vulnerable to divine power. However, you have been blessed by God, so this weakness is nullified.]\n[Resistances that lay dormant have been revealed.] ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ novel_fіre.net\nAs he saw the message stating that his evolution was complete, Lee Shin Woo, who had calmed himself down, checked his body and muttered.\n\"A Dark Skeleton, huh?\"\nA Skeleton Avenger, or a Skeleton Warrior, is like a ’job’ in a game, not a species. But this time, his species had actually changed.\nHonestly, his bones were all dyed black now, and with one look, he gave off more of a menacing impression than before. He felt that his strength and his magic were much stronger, to the extent that they were incomparable to before. If it was with his current strength, he felt as though he could face the Great Slime head on.\n’However, my bones have turned black, so will I be able to properly fool the skeletons...?’\nLee Shin Woo had a concern that truly befitted a hero, and smiled gently. He could actually feel just how much more powerful his body had become, so he was able to cleanly sweep away his uneasiness and concern over the future.\n\"Hoo... then.\"\nHe had something he needed to check first. Despite Lee Shin Woo roughly knowing, he shook for some reason, a reason that he himself couldn’t understand; he smiled bitterly and...\nOpened his status.",

Level 3 - 2>\n[Lee Shin Woo]\n[Dark Skeleton Avenger]\n[Treasure Hunter]\n[Lv - 3 (Status effectiveness 125%)]\n[Strength - 113 + 10 Agility - 108 + 10 Health - 127 + 10 Magic - 130 + 10] (While dungeon bonuses are applied)\n[Passive skills - Invisible Heart Lv3, Acting Lv4, Beginner Avenger Lv1, Low Rank Bursting Thunder Lv5, Low Rank Magic Affinity Lv3, Low Rank Stealth Lv3, Beginner Command Lv5]\n[Active skills - Bone Reinforcement Lv4, Low rank Combat Sprint Lv5, Low Rank Shriek of the Dead Lv1, Low Rank Regeneration Lv1, Beginner Catapult Lv9, Low Rank Flames of Revenge Lv1, Beginner Power Slash Lv7, Low Rank Harden Lv1, Low Rank Self-Destruct Lv1]\n[Resistances - Holy - MAX, Curse - MAX, Acid - Low Rank Lv1]\n\"Wow, it increased even more!?\"\nWhen he went up from level 1 to 2, his stats’ effectiveness increased by 10%. Of course, that was plenty amazing, but now that he’d risen from level 2 to 3, it had increased by an additional 15% to a total of 125% effectiveness!\nGo figure, it felt like his body was overflowing with power, but the Giant Slime, which was only one level higher than him, felt way too strong!\n’Levels really are everything in this world.’\nHe had acquired a lot of skills and had grown until now, but to properly unleash the power of those skills, his stats had to become his foundation.\nHe felt like he understood why his seniors were so focused on only increasing their levels. Plus, they had revealed that they were level 6, so he couldn’t imagine how powerful they were. Yet, even they wouldn’t dare challenge the deep darkness that lay within the Empire!\n’If we exclude the temporary bonus stats that the dungeon gives, my total stats are about 478. These numbers are impossible just from changing equipment... Ah, as I leveled up, my combat related skills went up as well. Because of that, my stats increased even more, I see.’\nBecause of that, Bursting Thunder, Catapult, Power Slash, and even the Command skill he hadn’t had an opportunity to properly use, naturally leveled up, and his level 9 Shriek of the Dead, as well as Regeneration went up to the low rank level all at once.\nLee Shin Woo knew how drastically the skills change when they go from the beginner level to low rank, so he was really excited and checked the information of the ranked up skills.\n[Low Rank Shriek of the Dead Lv1 (Active)]\n[Causes the enemy to lose their mind, and puts them into a ’frenzied’ state. Additionally, they are afflicted with ’Fear’ of the caster.]\n[Low Rank Regeneration Lv1 (Active)]\n[Damage is healed through magic. Regeneration speed and effectiveness increases.]\nThere was an option added to Regeneration stating that its speed and effectiveness increased, and there was a ’Fear’ option added to the Shriek of the Dead. He was excited as he wondered what kind of change this would bring upon the battlefield.\nHowever, there was something he was more excited for; it was the new skills he had gained. Honestly, most skills start at the beginner level, but both skills started at the low rank level!\n[Low Rank Harden Lv1 (Active)]\n[Consumes mana in order to harden and strengthen the area of your choosing. You can also apply this to your weapons or armor.]\n\"Oh, this is simple and precise, so it’s great.\"\nFirstly, the Harden skill should be great both offensively and defensively. Especially, since it was a low rank level, it had additional options, and those options made his eyes go wide. It would reinforce his equipment, making them both stronger and sturdier. It would work as an all-purpose skill!\n[Low Rank Self-Destruct Lv1 (Active)]\n[By exploding a section, or even your entire body, you inflict tremendous damage to your enemies. The damage increases geometrically the larger the area you explode.] Check latest chapters at novel[f]ire.net\nWhereas Self-Destruct seemed like it would be extremely difficult to use. He would die on the spot if he exploded his entire body, so who the hell would want to use this skill!?\nAt least Lee Shin Woo possessed the Invisible Heart skill, so it wouldn’t be so bad, but even taking that into account, it was definitely a skill with a horrific penalty.\n\"Moreover, even if I were to just explode a portion of my body, it ultimately just means that a portion of my body, which is attached to me, would explode right in front of me... Hmm?\nHe muttered like crazy, but then it hit him. A portion of the body... if that’s the case, then what if he were to remove a portion of his body and then explode it? He had just the right skill for that.\n’If I were to quickly launch my bone with my Catapult skill... and then add my Flames of Revenge to increase the accuracy and firepower...’\nIf he were to somehow succeed in integrating those three skills, he would completely rid himself of the weakness of ’self-damaging himself’, and it seemed like he’d be able to create a skill with the maximum explosive effect. It may be a bit dangerous, but it was worth it to test it.\n’Hmm?’\nLee Shin Woo, who had been immersed in his thoughts, suddenly looked over his status, and realized something new.\nIn exchange for the ’Blessed by God’ words being removed from his species, the moment he received Low Rank Acid Resistance, he saw that he had received a renewed section for Resistances, and two additional Resistances.\n’Holy - MAX, Curses - MAX... How much do I have to raise the level of my skills to get to MAX?’\nThese two skills weren’t new; he accurately interpreted it as the two Resistances that he already had being openly expressed in his Resistances section, something that had occurred following his level up, and the Resistances section being opened up.\nIt was much more intuitive, showing both his holy and curse Resistances maxed out, rather than a vague phrase like ’Blessed by God’. Looking at it like this, he suddenly realized just how much he had received from God.\n’But what she took from me was equally as large...!’\nDespite him leveling up to level 3, he grit his teeth at the empty space between his legs and his bald head. What, would she only feel better if she took it all!?\n\"Hoo, but still, for now...\"\nRather than getting fired up for unclear, visionless revenge, he should be focusing on his growth instead! After checking the dungeon reward, he would go to the secret shop. He would get stronger.\n\"...Huh?\"\nLee Shin Woo, who suppressed his rage and pacified himself, closed his status and checked the area where the Great Slime had died again; he soon realized that something was off.\n\"There’s no dungeon reward.\"\nHe had already cleared several dungeons. There wasn’t a single time where he wouldn’t receive a dungeon reward after defeating the boss monster. Aside from what the boss itself would drop, there would always be a small wooden box that appeared.\nBut there wasn’t one. What did this mean? The conclusion was simple.\n’Perhaps... Perhaps the Great Slime wasn’t the dungeon boss?’\nAfter thinking of that, he thought of the evidence that would back his hypothesis up one by one.\nWhen he had first entered this room, he thought it felt out of place! Now, that reason was clear. Normally, the moment a challenger shows up in the boss room, it automatically turns into a secret room, yet the Great Slime closed the door itself, which felt odd.\nMoreover, when he thought about it, even when he took down the Great Slime, he didn’t get a message that he’d cleared the dungeon. By now, there was no room for doubt. He hadn’t cleared this dungeon yet.\n\"Ha, an elite level 3 boss showed up in a level 1 dungeon, and you’re saying that wasn’t the main boss?\"\nSeriously? What the hell is this? Despite him already receiving a plentiful reward from the Great Slime, he was hit by a sense of frustration, feeling as though he hadn’t gotten a proper reward for his efforts. And then, a piece of rationality soon returned to him.\n’There definitely wasn’t any other path, though...’\nLee Shin Woo used the slimes to train, and to get the most bang for his buck, he searched the entire dungeon, and killed them all. He checked all the blocked paths, and found that the passageways merged into one. Yet, if this wasn’t the end of the dungeon, how would he even reach the end?\n- Tak, Tadak\nAt that moment, a piece of rock fell from the wall. Since the Great Slime had moved around, ramming here and there, it wouldn’t have been strange if the entire passageway had collapsed.\nHowever, as he thought that, he casually gazed at the wall, and was dumbfounded.\n\"This crazy...\"\nHe saw a tiny hole in the wall opposite the entrance, likely due to the Great Slime forcefully ramming, and digging into it. That’s right. A hole. There was definitely a room beyond that wall.\nLee Shin Woo shivered at the pitch black darkness, and the magic he felt beyond the wall. It was a concentration of magic that didn’t even compare to the room he was in! He was right. The dungeon continued on!\n\"... Shall we?\"\nLee Shin Woo checked the side of the wall that still endured, despite receiving several of the Great Slime’s charges, and took a deep breath. How could he turn back when he made it this far? He had to find out what was beyond this wall to be satisfied.\n’And just in time, I’ve come up with a great method.’\nLee Shin Woo stepped away from his target, the wall, and considerably widened the distance. After that, he raised a finger, and aimed for the largest crack in the wall.\nHe utilized his Flames of Revenge skill, which could target his own body after leveling up, and a black flame ignited on his index finger... he quickly launched his finger with his Catapult skill.\n- Kwang!\nThe Catapult skill itself was amazing enough. It was as if he shot a bullet, and the index finger quickly flew towards the wall, lodging so deeply into the wall that it couldn’t be seen. He saw the cracks in the wall get progressively more severe.\nIf he just sat still like this, the flames would gradually rise, and melt the wall. Of course, all of his magic would be depleted by then, so he couldn’t do that. Instead.\n\"Self-Destruct!\"\nLee Shin Woo focused as much as he could on his index finger and activated his skill. He was concerned that it wouldn’t work from far away, or that he hadn’t adapted to the skill yet, resulting in his entire body blowing up, but... they were all pointless concerns. His test had succeeded!\n- Kwaaang!\nThe Self-Destruct skill’s effect was quite amazing. Despite activating the skill by targeting his finger bone, it held an incredibly destructive power.\nHis index finger bone, which exploded magnificently in tandem with the flames, emitted a boom, and caused immense damage to the wall. The wall seemed to hold for a brief moment, but soon couldn’t withstand the force, and crumbled, revealing the room within for all to see.\n[Level 1 dungeon - You have found a secret path in the Dirtied Sewers. The dungeon information has been updated. Magic has increased by 1.]\n[Level 2 elite dungeon - You have acquired a permit for the Secret Sewers. All stats within the dungeon increase by 5. The dungeon information is added to your minimap. All of your actions are buffed within the dungeon.]\n\"A level 2... elite dungeon.\"\nHe had learned about elite dungeons just a little while ago from listening to his seniors. There was a high chance that especially strong, elite named monsters would appear, and the dungeon reward was great, but it was that much harder compared to normal dungeons.\n\"Hoo...\"\nThere was an extraordinary mana being exuded from beyond the opening, so he thought it wasn’t a normal dungeon, but... he stopped himself from being drawn in by the concentrated magic and thoughtlessly walking in.\nIt was an entrance that he had barely found after defeating a level 3 elite monster. If he took it lightly and went in, he might get into some trouble.\n’But still, I have to go inside.’\nHe wanted to prepare as much as possible before going inside. If one were to ask what those preparations were, there was obviously only one answer.\nIt was the secret shop.",

    "content": "<Chapter 6. Level 3 - 3 [End of Volume 1]>\n\"Guten Abend[1], Mr. Skeleton.\"\nThe red haired beauty sat behind the silver counter, and was eating an orange. When she saw him, she raised her hand and waved. Lee Shin Woo opened his eyes (he didn’t have any, but that’s how he felt), and asked.\n\"In what time zone is that the standard way of greeting someone?\"\n\"That obviously depends on how I feel. You’re underground, Customer, so you probably don’t know the time. But the passage of time differs for each region; you have at least that much general knowledge, right?\"\n\"...\"\nAfter hearing that, he suddenly felt curious. He wondered where this merchant usually stayed. Since she talked about time above ground, she might be someone who lives above ground.\nShe might’ve misunderstood his gaze, as the merchant hid the orange in her hand and spoke defensively.\n\"I’m not giving this to you. It’s something that’s hard to obtain in the Empire.\"\n\"I’m not interested, you know? Plus, I can’t eat it, even if you give it to me!\"\n\"Ah, right.\"\nThe merchant cheerfully laughed while peeling the rest of the orange and throwing the slices in her mouth. Lee Shin Woo promised that she’d get her just desserts someday, and asked her something. It was to decide what he would do with the ’Beginner Stealth’ skill book that he had continuously stored in his inventory.\n\"I acquired a skill book for a skill I’ve already learned, so can I sell it here?\"\n\"I’d recommend that you read it.\"\n\"Even though I’ve already learned it?\"\n\"Though you’ve already learned the skill, the experience within each skill book differs. Your proficiency should also increase. And... unfortunately, our shop doesn’t handle beginner skill books.\"\n\"It’s such a great skill, so why!?\"\nThe shopkeeper giggled, and said.\n\"It’s only good when one is placed in a peculiar situation like yours, Customer. Aside from you, Customer, most of the other heroes are higher than level 4, so when would they have time to train the skill while fighting monsters higher than level 4? It would just add another unnecessary weakness.\"\n\"Ugh...\"\nIt was a reasonable criticism. As he shook, he meekly retrieved the skill book and opened it. He didn’t really need to read it. The moment he opened the book, the contents of the book entered into his brain, fully intact.\n[The Low Rank Stealth skill has become level 4. You can move without making a sound. Agility has increased by 1.]\nIt was truly frustrating that the knowledge and the experiences within the skill book were never light. Lee Shin Woo, who had already trained and familiarized himself with the skill, was even more greatly aware of this, and by the time the skill book, which had done its job, disappeared into mana particles, the level of his skill went up.\nThe merchant beamed, as if she already knew about it, and looked straight at him. Lee Shin Woo felt angry, and was pointlessly curt, proposing the next order of business.\n\"Please give me a bone. The most expensive and worthwhile bone that I can afford.\"\n\"Hmm, you’re level 3, right Customer? Level 3 bones are quite cheap, but they probably wouldn’t help you right now. Then, you’d have to go up to level 4 bones, though I don’t think you’d have that kind of money Customer... Oh my, you have more than 70,000 Perium already. How?\"\nWhen she checked the amount of Perium he had, her eyes gleamed with what appeared to be amusement.\n\"It’s honestly not very surprising that you’ve leveled up to level 3 in two weeks since being dropped into the Empire. If we consider the power that you were given, we can say that you’re talented. However, the total amount of money you gathered in that short period of time, as well as your Invisible Heart which has stopped at level 3... Customer, you’re a bit interesting.\"\n\"I knew you thought I was interesting the first time you saw me, though.\"\nThe skeleton replied, uninterested. She burst out into an even greater laughter and clapped. And then she made an extremely unexpected offer.\n\"Very good. I’ve become interested in your story. Would you like to tell me about your experiences until now?\"\n\"Are you going to give me something?\"\n\"I wasn’t planning on just hearing about your experiences for free. I’ll reduce the price of your item by 20,000 Perium.\"\n\"Please sit down.\"\nIn exchange for telling his story, she would cut down the price of the transaction by 20,000 Perium, so he had no reason to refuse. He immediately straightened his neck and faced her. Her red eyes glowed, as if there were magic within them. She looked like she couldn’t hold back her anticipation.\n’Damn it, she’s extremely pretty.’\nIt wasn’t a problem that she was a beauty. The problem was that he didn’t feel uneasy whatsoever when facing such a beauty.\n\"So in the beginning...\"\nLee Shin Woo started his story with those dismal feelings. He precisely and concisely picked out the central parts of his story, from the moment he ended up in the Empire, to now.\n\"So, I ended up finding the path that leads to a level 2 elite dungeon, and decided to drop by here.\"\n\"Hoo, indeed.\"\nThe merchant breathed out, seemingly expressing satisfaction, and opened her mouth.\n\"That guile, that composure... Above all, your obsession over your life has caused a change, Customer. Even though you possess 100 lives, to think you’d place so much value on each and every one of them. Even God probably wouldn’t have been able to predict this. Yes... by doing so, you became a new Trickster, Customer.\"\n\"Is that really important?\"\n\"It is important. You’re walking a path which no one else can walk in this world where everything is decided by karma. Moreover, you’ve already acquired 8 tokens at this stage? Ha, you’re interesting. Really interesting. I don’t feel like the Perium has gone to waste.\"\nShe clapped her hands and nodded her head. Lee Shin Woo felt like he had become an entertainer somewhere and asked her a question.\n\"If this information gets leaked to the others...\"\n\"It won’t happen. I double as an informant, but your information will not be leaked to anyone else, aside from me, and will be kept a secret. Even if that person is another hero.\"\n\"That’s a relief.\"\nAnd it was also beneficial that he’d learned that she doubled as an informant. Right now, he didn’t have any problems as he had a lot of things to do right now, but further along the line, if his progress were to be blocked, it wouldn’t be bad to pay her Perium in exchange for her advice.\nWhen they were completely finished with their talk, Lee Shin Woo went on to the next matter.\n\"If you’re satisfied, you’re going to reduce the price by 20,000 Perium, right?\"\n\"I said I’m not a Trickster, so I’ll settle the deal fairly. Here, I’ve picked out the most expensive bones that you can buy with 91,130 Perium.\"\nShe took out two bones, one by one, from underneath the counter, and laid them atop the counter. One of them was a blue bone, and the other was a red bone. When he saw those two bones, he didn’t know what to say.\n\"With a discount of 20,000 Perium... The red bone costs 67,510 Perium, and the blue bone costs 71,040 Perium.\"\n\"To think I’d have to pick between two bones again...\"\nThere’s a limit to bad taste! Moreover, though the colors are the same as last time, the levels are different, and they’re bones from a completely different monster! Lee Shin Woo, while firmly grinding his teeth, checked the prices first. If he bought the blue bone, he would be left with 90[2] Perium, and was pissed since it was similar to last time.\n\"You obviously can’t tell me what monster it came from, right?\"\n\"Of course. Ah, if you were to buy a cheaper bone, you could check the information right after, but would you like to do that? Though I wouldn’t recommend it.\"\nThe merchant didn’t hide her intent and snickered. Perhaps she had offered the 20,000 Perium discount in order to present these two bones at the same time and to piss him off!\nLee Shin Woo meticulously inspected the exterior of the two bones. He couldn’t differentiate them by their hardness alone, and the magic coming from them as well...\nWait a second, magic?\n\"...Hmm.\"\n\"Hoh.\"\nWhen Lee Shin Woo concentrated deeply on the two bones, the merchant looked amused.\n\"You’re honestly a bit surprising. To think you’d awaken such aptitude in magic from just the experience you acquired from that bone last time... Oh my, it seems like you already can’t hear what I’m saying.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nThere was magic in all the bones he’d acquired until now. It was just that the tendency of that magic changed.\nWhen the bones contained a pure, deep magic, he would gain magic stat points, but if there was a different, complex power within, he could gain other stats as well.\n’While it was alive, the owner of the bone had a special power, and that special power was wrapped in magic; through Bone Reinforcement, that lock was removed, and it felt like that power was transferred to me intact...’\nOf course, even if he didn’t know what monster the bones in front of him belonged to, he had absorbed hundreds, if not thousands of bones that raised various stats. Though he didn’t know about the skills, he felt like he could read the pattern of the magic that changed depending on which stat it would raise.\n[Low Rank Magic Affinity has become Lv4. Magic has increased by 3.]\n’...Yeah, I feel like I know now.’\nOf course, since they were both level 4 bones, the amount and quality of the mana differed compared to the other bones he had acquired, and the pattern boasted a complexity on another level to those that came before, but... still, he could read the flow of mana within and when he exerted himself, he was able to intuitively grasp the abilities of the bones.\n’The red bone is clearly from a warrior, or something similar. I can probably gain strength and health from that one. The blue bone is... honestly purely magic. It’s a magician. To think that they’d really be divided based on color...’\nHe didn’t need to think about it complicatedly. Both the red bone and the blue bone would reveal their owner’s power and characteristics. The red magic corresponded to strength and health, while the blue magic was entirely focused on magic, and emitted light.\n’Between the two, the one I need the most right now is...’\nRight now, when the level 2 elite dungeon is right ahead of him, which ability should he increase? If he were to just look at his stats, he should leave his excessively grown magic stat, and it seemed like procuring strength and health was a good choice. Moreover, acquiring the warrior’s skill was appealing...\nHowever.\n\"I’ll go with the blue bone.\"\nDespite all that, Lee Shin Woo chose the blue bone, which would further increase the imbalance among his stats. He honestly thought that there wasn’t any other choice but the blue bone.\nWhether it be the Regeneration skill that he had made good use of in this dungeon, or the Harden skill that he’d have to concentrate on and train, or the Flames of Revenge, etc; using all these various skills necessitated him using mana.\nSo, for Lee Shin Woo, who considered training his skills as important as gaining stats, there was honestly no other choice from the very beginning.\n\"Haha, does it seem like I’ll say something?\"\nBut it seemed like the merchant was satisfied with his decision. She smiled brightly, grabbing the red bone and returning it, and passed the blue bone to him. Lee Shin Woo slightly tilted his head towards the inquiring merchant.\n\"Are you saying it was an excellent choice?\"\n\"Yes, you’re right. You made a really, really good decision. You may be the greatest Trickster that God has created.\"\nEver since Lee Shin Woo had divided the two bones based on their magic, she had been continuously smiling, and that smile only further deepened now.\n\"Magic is the basis for all strength. It’s fine, so long as it’s not an amount that the body cannot withstand, causing the body to break. Since you can do the rest with magic anyway. I’m talking about strengthening the body, as well as its changes. This is especially important to you, Customer, who has opened your eyes to magic at an early stage.\"\nAs he listened to her, Lee Shin Woo had a hunch. He could heal his shattered body through Regeneration, and the Harden skill he had just received could strengthen his body. So, there should be another skill that lets him reinforce his body in a different way.\nOf course, strength, agility, and health were the fundamental abilities that influence the body and they were certainly important stats, but even when combining the three, magic was more important.\n\"Thank you. I’ve received your payment of 71,040 Perium.\"\n\"Then, I’ll get going now. I’ll come back faster next time and get that red bone, so please wait for me.\"\n\"Ah, please wait just a minute.\"\nHe didn’t regret his decision, but he still had a lingering attachment to that red bone. He spoke the lines that retreating enemy troops would say, and when he was about to leave, the merchant grabbed him.\n\"I haven’t properly heard your name yet, Customer.\"\n\"...My name is Lee Shin Woo.\"\nHe thought that the merchant would’ve already known his name by now, but Lee Shin Woo obediently told her his name. Lee Shin Woo would see her a lot in the future, so he thought it’d be better to formally introduce himself.\n\"My name is Pleine. As you can see, I’m responsible for the secret shop.\"\n\"Then I’ll see you next time, Pleine.\"\n\"I hope you’ll come and see me when you’ve become stronger.\"\nIt wasn’t just his imagination that the merchant... Pleine seemed to be kinder to him than before. And that was all because he had personally proven his potential. The greatest virtue on this planet was none other than strength.\nHe suddenly realized that fact, smiling bitterly, he left the secret shop. He then returned to the clearing, in front of the dark, lengthy passageway.\n\"Hoo, then...\" Orıginal content can be found at N0velFire.ɴet\nSince he roughly knew the result, he didn’t shake that much. After Lee Shin Woo had briefly grasped that there was no danger in his periphery, he boldly activated his Bone Reinforcement. He somehow figured out that it was a part of something else, and it was actually part of the skull, the sphenoid bone.\n[Reinforcing the sphenoid bone. Your compatibility with the target is incredibly high and you have acquired a skill with great success! Magic has increased by 24. You are more deeply absorbing ???’s experiences and memories.]\n\"Hey, wait...!?\"\nLee Shin Woo, who realized that the activation of the skill was different from last time, hurriedly tried to gesture, but it was obviously to no avail.\nAn enormous amount of information and a clear consciousness entered his brain, and for a short time, his consciousness was completely locked away.\nAnd the appearance of another world unfolded.\n[1] T/N: Good evening in German.\n[2] T/N: Toika wrote 90 Perium last time when it should’ve been 70, but he counted correctly this time.",

    "content": "<Chapter 7. Three way - 1>\nBy the time Lee Shin Woo got a hold of himself, he was in a bright interior, rather than the sewers. It was as if he were in a dream, as the surrounding landscape looked blurry, and he couldn’t move his body as he wished. Though he was able to indirectly experience the feeling of a human’s body, he wasn’t very happy.\nYes, he was looking through a certain human’s memories. It was a moment where he once again felt the endless abilities of Bone Reinforcement.\n\"I’m here, Teacher.\"\nThose words came out of his own mouth. That person, whose body was permeated with Lee Shin Woo’s consciousness, spoke those words, and raised his head. For the first time, he saw someone else in the room. He was really old, frail, and even the mana within him wasn’t anything special.\n’Teacher? But this guy seems like he’s way stronger.’\nSince he was within this person’s body, he knew for sure. Lee Shin Woo had just become level 3 and possessed an ample amount of magic, yet this guy had much more mana than himself. He was obviously a higher level than him, and had probably focused on his growth in magic.\nWhereas the strength of the old man before him wasn’t even at the level of a Skeleton Warrior. If they were to quibble over mana, the old man had about half of Lee Shin Woo’s mana. Normally, Lee Shin Woo didn’t have the ability to precisely measure someone else’s mana, but it was possible for the person who he was inhabiting.\n\"Gerrit... why have you come?\"\n\"I have something I must tell you.\"\nOf course, since they had a teacher-student relationship, strength probably wasn’t that important. They don’t say that the ’student surpasses the master’ for nothing. For starters, Lee Shin Woo decided he’d listen to their conversation.\n\"I have nothing to hear from you.\"\n\"Teacher, I heard you’ve become responsible for a group that’s researching under His Majesty’s supervision.\"\n\"...Where did you hear about that?\"\n\"That’s not important. What’s important is that what you’re doing is wrong.\"\nAh, as expected. When he thought about it, the last time he reinforced his skull, he remembered hearing about ’research’ of some kind. He had roughly guessed what it was, but this memory made it clear what the research was. It was the research that would fill this Empire with the undead.\n\"Teacher, you must stop that research at once. It’s research that’s twisted at its very core. Bringing immortality within everyone’s reach will bring nothing more than ruin!\"\n\"But that’s what His Majesty wants.\"\n\"Isn’t it you, who had told me that this research was wrong?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Teacher, please tell me honestly. Who’s the one who really wants immortality? Is it His Majesty? Or...\"\nAround now, Lee Shin Woo started to feel like he was watching a movie. The Empire had fallen anyway, so there was no need to be on the edge of his seat! He watched their conversation extremely comfortably. Meanwhile, it seemed as though their argument was reaching its climax.\n\"Ha. Yes, one born with genius such as you wouldn’t understand what it feels like to lack in natural ability and be unable to proceed to the next stage; you don’t know how wretched it feels...\"\n\"I just practiced as you taught me, Teacher.\"\n\"Then why couldn’t I reach that level!?\"\nSuddenly, the old man’s temper flared. It felt as though it had built up, more and more, and had finally exploded.\n\"I lack in talent, in magic, and in everything! I can’t... I can’t get to level 3 before I die. Karma... I don’t have enough karma...! At least, if I don’t buy more time!\"\n\"And yet, why are you voluntarily trying to shoulder the burden of the horrific karma that you vehemently rejected in the past!? At the time, you were the one I respected the most!\"\n\"You don’t know! You, who has everything, wouldn’t know what it feels like!\"\nThe old man suddenly screamed. But Lee Shin Woo thought he had heard that voice somewhere before, and then, a truly shocking development occurred. The teacher had been delivering his impassioned speech, and suddenly, one of his eyes popped out and rolled onto the floor.\n\"What the...!?\"\n\"Ugh!\"\nThat wasn’t all. The teacher suddenly vomited rotten blood and bowed his head. His student, Gerrit, had a hunch that something had gone terribly wrong, but the moment he was about to retreat, his teacher raised his head and suddenly attacked him. The teacher’s eyes had turned yellow, and had a dull glow! It was like the standard development for a zombie.\n\"Kyaaaaahk!\"\n\"What the hell!?\"\nGerrit realized that his teacher, who had sought immortality, had instantly become an existence furthest from life... he had changed into an undead. He quickly diagnosed whether he could turn his teacher back to normal or not, but soon, shook his head, and extended his hand.\n’Ooooh...!’\nIn a brief instance, the world’s mana responded to his call, and he instantly created a net comprised of mana, trapping his teacher. It was the stage that his teacher had so fervently desired to reach.\nLee Shin Woo felt it across his entire body and was deeply touched. So this was how you handled mana! He could energetically feel it all: how Gerrit had manifested his will in that brief moment, how he drew out the mana within his body, and how he caused change in the mana.\n\"Kyahak, Kyahaaahk...!\"\n\"Damn it, Teacher...\"\nHis teacher, who had transformed into a zombie, also raised his mana and struggled; but when Gerrit grit his teeth and flicked his finger, the mana net changed into flames and began to magnificently burn his teacher. When he released the flames, all that remained was a small blue bone.\n\"Damn it, what the hell did those bastards do to him...!\"\nThe sole survivor, Gerrit, persistently grit his teeth, muttered, and picked up the bone fragment. The mana that arose from his body almost acted as proof of his rage.\n\"I can’t let this insanity go on any longer. I have to protect the Empire at all costs. To do that, damn it...\"\nGerrit chewed on his lips. Whereas Lee Shin Woo was concentrating so desperately in order to further engrave Gerrit’s high level mana control into his mind that he couldn’t feel sympathy for him.\n\"...In the end, I have no choice but to meet with General Seagald.\"\n’It’s Seagald again!?’\nHe couldn’t help but retort when he heard about General Seagald! However, Lee Shin Woo hoped that he would explain what Seagald did, though unfortunately his hope was dashed, as that was the last thing he heard before his consciousness became faint.\nIt was as if someone decided that these were all the experiences and memories that he could receive, and cut it short. His sight turned dark, and his own senses gradually returned to him. Back to the senses of his cold, hard bone body.\n\"Tch.\"\n[Low Rank Magic Affinity has become Lv7. Magic has increased by 10.]\n[You have learned the passive skill, Low Rank Magic Accumulation. Magic has increased by 5. You can draw your mana naturally, and by amassing it within your body, your total amount of magic increases; and by doing so, your body will harmonize with your mana better than before.]\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo completely awakened within the sewers, he received concise, and amazing messages one after another; he rubbed his (nonexistent) eyes. His Magic Affinity had leveled up and he had acquired a new skill, a really important one at that!\n’Mmm.’\nHe had learned a skill that was essential in handling magic, and the Magic Affinity skill had sharply increased, so he could say that he had no regrets, but... the name, Seagald, weighed on his mind, so he couldn’t feel happy about his growth.\n’Since I keep hearing his name, he must’ve really been an influential figure in the Empire...’\nHe briefly pondered over it, but soon opened the chatting channel. It should be alright to ask his seniors about Seagald just once. He was famous enough for the skeletons to say his name in their death throes, so there should be someone amongst them that knew who he was.\n[Lee Shin Woo: Seniors, may I ask a question?]\n[Yasunori Akira: The newbie, huh. It’s good that you’re not dead.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: Haha...]\nIt was something that he took as a greeting whenever he entered the chatting channel. It meant it was that hard to survive in this Empire. He smiled bitterly and started to speak.\n[Lee Shin Woo: Have you perhaps heard of the name Seagald?]\n[Yasunori Akira: Ah... it does seem like I might’ve heard that somewhere.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: I’ve heard of him. He’s one of the generals, right? From what I’ve heard, it seems like there were 12 generals in this Empire.]\n[Shino Rendu: Have you cleared the dungeon? That’s a relief.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Because you worried about me, I was able to safely clear the dungeon.] Thɪs chapter is updatᴇd by novel※fire.net\n[Prince Altania: Whoever he was, that Seagald guy must’ve been really popular. The lower ranked the skeleton, the more fervently they talk about him.]\n[Seira Von Retadane: Seagald... He’s probably an undead right now as well. He’s our enemy.]\n[Prince Altania: That’s obvious.]\nAs expected, it seems like his seniors had heard about Seagald before. Though he did feel disappointed that he couldn’t get any additional information on him from them... Lee Shin Woo clicked his tongue and Seira asked him a question.\n[Seira Von Retadane: However, Mr. Lee Shin Woo. Do you perhaps have a reason for asking about Seagald...?]\n[Lee Shin Woo: Ah, like my other seniors, I’ve heard a lot about this Seagald guy from the skeletons. I was just curious as to who he was...]\n[Seira Von Retadane: I see. However, Mr. Lee Shin Woo, regarding that person...]\nWhen Seira was about to say something more, something happened.\n[Ms. Ye Jin Jin has entered.]\n[Ye Jin Jin: Please save me! Somebody please save me!]\n\"...\"\nLee Shin Woo stiffened at the sudden call for help, but his seniors clicked their tongues, as if they were used to it.\n[Lloyd H.K.: Damn it... I’d thought it’d been too long for everyone to come out unscathed.]\n[Prince Altania: Rest in peace, Ye Jin Jin. ...If I see you later, I’ll make sure to burn you to a crisp.]\n[Ye Jin Jin: You’re too much...! I-I’m going to die! I... ggyahk! A zombie, it’s a huge zombie!]\n[Erian Ruparte: Jin Jin, where are you!? Where are you right now!? I need to know where you are if you want me to help!]\n[Seira Von Retadane: ...It’s no use, Ruparte. God really values us, and if we’re close enough to help, a quest will occur, even without her call for help...]\n[Erian Ruparte: N-No... then are you saying we just have to sit here and watch her die?]\n[Shino Rendu: We’ve already seen several dozens of heroes dying from here. We have a lot of regrets and remorse. You should just shut up if you’re going to talk about responsibility or having a conscience so lightly.]\n[Erian Ruparte: That’s...]\nIn an instant, the mood in the chatting channel calmed down exceedingly. The seniors who got along well with her were distressed, and even those speaking curtly couldn’t hide their pity for her... Lee Shin Woo understood all of them, and he even understood those who remained silent.\n[Lloyd H.K.: Sorry I couldn’t save you, Ye Jin Jin...]\n[Ye Jin Jin: Please save me... Please...!]\nHowever, their mood didn’t match Lee Shin Woo at all. Even though a human being was on the verge of death, they’re not even uneasy? Was it because he also felt contempt for himself, since he was also like them? Since he was suddenly starting to be unsure of his own identity?\nThey were all right, but they were also all wrong.\n[A quest has occurred!]\n[Hero Rescue]\n[A hero close by you is in a life threatening crisis. If you succeed in perfectly rescuing her, you will acquire a suitable reward. Of course, if you fail or ignore her call, there won’t be anyone who blames you, but there may be those who mock you and say that you are foolish.]\n[Quest reward - 3 permits to God’s secret shop, 1 random skill book, acquisition of a suitable amount of stats and Perium, and Lv3 equipment reinforcement permits based on your contributions.]\nThat’s right.\nIt seems like this girl was nearby.",

    "content": "<Chapter 7. Three way - 2>\nLee Shin Woo accepted the quest, left the clearing and approached the sewer’s ceiling.\nHe had gone through the entire sewers over and over again for several days, so he knew the structure of the sewers well. There were other ways besides the official entrance to get into the dungeon, so the opposite was also true.\n’Good, as I expected, there’s a crack.’\nHe used his Bone of Thunder Lasting to shatter a drain pipe. No matter how tough the drain pipe was, it wouldn’t be able to endure a hardened, Lv3 weapon’s Power Slash.\n- Kwaaaa\nA heap of dirt spilled out and fell, but Lee Shin Woo didn’t let it bother him. It had been a long time since these sewers had lost their original purpose. He wasn’t going to complain just because of some dirt.\n’It shouldn’t be blocked to the point that I won’t be able to come back, right?’\nOf course, it didn’t matter, even if it were blocked. He would just break through it and go on his merry way. Like right now! He returned his weapon, and like a mole, violently dug through the dirt, and procured a route to the surface.\nHe couldn’t have even dreamed of doing this when he was still human, but since he was an undead that didn’t need to breath now, it was quite simple. Since the sewers weren’t that deep, he was able to escape rather quickly.\n\"Hoo.\"\nLee Shin Woo, who had gotten outside, sensed a huge presence straight in front of him. Would it take around 2 minutes by running? It was a distance close enough that could be seen with the naked eye. A black haired Asian girl was in the middle of running hectically; behind her, a huge three meter giant undead was quickly chasing her...\n[Lv4 Acid Ghoul - Edward L. Baker]\n[You have found the target of your revenge. When you initiate battle, all abilities increase by 20%. Flames of Revenge receive an additional 20% increase.]\n\"Ha, really.\"\nThe one he had encountered, and succeeded in barely running away from was none other than that Giant Zombie! Moreover, it had grown to become a level 4 Ghoul!\n[Human...! It’s been a long time since I’ve seen... a human possessing such appetizing flesh...!]\n\"Ggyaaaaaaaahk! Save meeeeeeee!\"\nThough its body was smaller than the last time, considering how the Acid Poison it spread was getting stronger and stronger, as well as how its movement speed seemed faster than a normal monster’s, it was certain that it had leveled up.\nHe had thought that it wasn’t a normal monster, but why did it have to be the one to rise to level 4, and why did it have to be the one attacking another hero...\n’Should I run away?’\nLee Shin Woo naturally thought. However, he soon shook his head.\nIt wasn’t because he pitied the girl, who was weeping and ran while dragging her injured leg. It wasn’t sympathy, contempt, goodwill, or regret either.\nRather, he didn’t feel anything for the girl, to the point that he felt like he’d start feeling contempt for himself. He would’ve readily helped her if it wasn’t very difficult, but it was also a situation where he didn’t really want to actively help her. It made him realize that he was a completely different person from before.\nDespite that, there was only one reason why he couldn’t easily back down. He coveted this quest reward so much that he was ready to sacrifice a life or two to get it.\n’Moreover, I have the Avenger skill right now, as well as the Flames of Revenge...’\nAll of his abilities increased by 20%, so even though the zombie had amplified its stats by reaching level 4, he thought it was definitely worth a shot. He hadn’t been aware that the Avenger skill would additionally buff his Flames of Revenge skill, which was a happy miscalculation. He had procured a surefire way of inflicting damage to it.\nMoreover, the fact that it was a monster that used Acid Poison was another reason that made Lee Shin Woo so bold. He had already cleared the slimes’ den and come out, and in the process, his Acid Poison Resistance had gotten to the low rank level! He was sure he wouldn’t be helpless against its Acid Poison this time.\nNow that his mind was made up, there was only one problem left.\n’Can I take care of this issue without exposing my identity to that girl?’\nIdeally, he would act as an aloof Skeleton Knight, who wandered around following the collapse of the Empire; he would take care of the Acid Ghoul, receive the quest reward, and leave worry free... He wasn’t sure if that would actually work, but for starters, Lee Shin Woo decided to run with that concept for now.\nOf course, even if he is exposed, it wouldn’t be too much of a problem. He was an undead, but it was undeniable that he was also a hero. He had all the evidence in the world to prove that he was one.\n\"Alright, then...\"\nLee Shin Woo finished all of his calculations and raised his index finger. A black flame wrapped around his finger and softly burned.\nHe carefully raised his finger and aimed at the Acid Ghoul, whose heavy feet stomped onto the floor, and ran quickly. Perhaps it was by chance, or perhaps it was necessity, but the girl was running towards him, and because of that, it became much easier to aim at the Ghoul.\n\"Ready... Aim... FIRE!\"\nHis index finger was launched, accompanied by a simple, short, and powerful pain.\nThe black flame engulfed the index finger and it went afar, faster than any bullet; it cut through the air, advanced, and burrowed into the Ghoul’s shoulder!\n’Tch.’\nLee Shin Woo briefly clicked his tongue. It was obvious, but he had originally aimed for its head. Of course, even if he had hit its head, he probably wouldn’t have taken it down in one hit, but he was disappointed it didn’t work out.\n[Guwoooooooh!]\n\"A-An undead...!? But that attack just now...?\"\nWhile Lee Shin Woo was busy complaining, the Ghoul, as well as the girl, inspected him. The Ghoul shrieked, filled with pain and anger, and the girl was incredibly flustered at the unprecedented sight of an undead attacking another undead.\n\"Oh, ggyaahk!\"\nBecause of that, she sprained her ankle and fell to the floor. That dumbass!\n[Human! Eating!]\nRather than punish the skeleton that attacked it, it seemed like the Ghoul decided to eat the human in front of it first. Lee Shin Woo inwardly wanted to get rid of her of right now, and exploded the index finger burrowed in its shoulder!\n[Ggaaaaaaaaaaahk!]\n\"Euguk, Euuk, heuggeuk...\"\nThe effect was amazing! The Ghoul was about to grab the girl’s head with its rough arm, but its shoulder joint burst; it wasn’t able to endure the horrific pain and stood in place, roaring in pain.\nWhereas it seemed like the girl had realized that she had just escaped death, and even while crying, desperately moved her body and escaped the Ghoul. She had already been afflicted by its Acid Poison, so about half of her clothes had been melted, and she truly wasn’t dressed decently. However, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t agitated by that at all. It should’ve been alright if he’d been a little uneasy, though...\n[Kuwaaaaaaaah! Annoying, a mere skeleton!]\n\"Jeez, you burn well. It’s hot enough to cook a sweet potato!\"\nThe satisfying result of his attack soothed his regret of losing something important. It was because above the Ghoul’s tattered shoulder joint, the clear black flames still blazed on, and gnawed at the Ghoul.\nHe knew it was an amazing combination, but he didn’t think it’d be this effective. If he could repeatedly use this technique from afar, whether it be an Acid Ghoul or anything else, they would die all the same. New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on NoveI(F)ire.net\n[Annoying guy, die!]\n\"Tch.\"\nHowever, that was still only the ideal situation. There was no way that his opponent would take that kind of horrific pain and idiotically stay put. The Acid Ghoul seemed to be really pissed, as it even let the appetizing human go, and sprinted at full speed towards him!\nLee Shin Woo ascertained its speed, as well as the direction it was going, and raised his other hand’s index finger, which he had already ignited with the Flames of Revenge, aimed, and fired.\n\"Firing again!\"\n[Kyahak!]\nBut surprisingly, the Ghoul swiftly swung its arm and parried the shot, as if he were waiting for it!\nOf course, the Flames of Revenge excellently shifted to its arm, attached to it, and began burning it, but he hadn’t gotten an opportunity to explode his shot; it just miserably bounced off, and rolled onto the floor. Lee Shin Woo saw that, and though he had roughly expected it, he clicked his tongue.\n’Tch, well it is a level 4.’\nIt had a much faster reaction speed than a normal zombie, and the durability of its body was different as well. In a scenario where the Ghoul noticed him, and he wanted to fight it using Catapult, he felt like he’d need to be at least level 5. The fact that he’d gotten the first hit in was a tremendous success.\n\"Now I have to fight it off myself.\"\nIn preparation for the coming Ghoul, he regenerated both of his fingers, and tightly gripped the Bone of Thunder Lasting. He activated Harden, applying it to both his sword and his armor, and even ignited the Flames of Revenge on his sword. Even so, he still had mana to spare.\n’If it was before, it wouldn’t have been strange for close to half of my mana to have been drained by now, but right now, my mana’s overflowing.’\nSince he’d strengthened himself with Gerrit’s sphenoid bone, Lee Shin Woo’s magic was at 173. Moreover, his Low Rank Magic Affinity had risen to level 7, and he obtained the Low Rank level 1 Magic Accumulation. Even at this very moment, the two skills were drawing the surrounding mana towards him and replenishing his mana. So at least in terms of mana, there was a world of difference between him today and him yesterday.\n[You are exposed to the Acid Ghoul’s strengthened Acid Poison. Low Rank Acid Resistance is mitigating the damage.]\n[I’ll crush you, Skeleton!]\n\"Ugh...!\"\nWhile he was busy preparing for the battle, the Ghoul had gotten really close. Its Acid Poison had become even more fearsome than before, and Lee Shin Woo, feeling as though his entire body would be melted away, had attacked first. Though it was actually bearable due to his Acid Resistance. He prayed that his armor would last until the end of the battle, and activated his skill.\n\"Power Slash!\"\n[Dieeeeeeeee!]\nThe Ghoul’s sharp nails and the Bone of Thunder Lasting clashed. Immediately after the horrific shriek, Lee Shin Woo’s body was mercilessly pushed back. In the ground, there were traces of two deep lines.\n\"Ggeuuuuhk.\"\n[You’re weak! Skeleton!]\nDespite using Power Slash, the strength behind Lee Shin Woo’s strike couldn’t match up to the Ghoul’s. It was obvious. Even though his strength was counterbalanced by the amplification effect of his Avenger skill, he still couldn’t contest a level 4 as a level 3 with purely stats.\n’Moreover, this asshole seems to have especially high strength...!’\nLee Shin Woo gripped his sword with both hands, whereas the Ghoul extended one hand, so he was even more shocked. He grit his teeth and attempted to parry its arm, but its forearm was as hard as steel.\nThe flame blazing on his sword shifted to its arm, attached to it, and began to burn it, but he couldn’t defeat the Ghoul with just that degree of pain. The flames on its shoulder were gradually expanding, so now it looked like some sort of flame giant.\n\"Eeek, Power Sla...\"\n[Not a chance!]\nLee Shin Woo pushed its arm away, and tried to use his Power Slash again, but the Ghoul used its other arm to smash him, like a straw cutter.\nLee Shin Woo, who used his Combat Sprint to seize that split second opportunity, swiftly retreated both his body and sword, and rolled onto the floor. Instead, the Ghoul’s arm burst open the innocent ground and sank into it. It was truly a horrific destructive power.\n[To think you’d get away! Die. I’m telling you... to die!]\n’Damn it, since it became level 4, our levels are worlds apart. It seems like it’s at least 300 stats higher than me... How the hell am I supposed to win?’\nLee Shin Woo evaded its next attack and had to consecutively back away. By simply swinging its arms, the ground was hollowed out, forming small craters; when he saw that, before fear, he just felt astonished. ...It was a relief that it wasn’t very hard to dodge them.\n[Kuwaaaaahk! You rat...! A mere skeleton without a bit of flesh...!]\n\"Then are you that slow due to you having all that flesh? Oh, boy.\"\n[Kugiaaaaaht!]\nThe Ghoul truly had tremendous strength and health, but it wasn’t very fast. The fact that Lee Shin Woo was able to dodge its attacks was proof of that. However, he couldn’t just move around dodging this guy forever...\n[You are being exposed to the Acid Ghoul’s strengthened Acid Poison.]\n[Low Rank Acid Resistance has become Lv2.]\n’My armor’s steadily melting away. I won’t last long like this...’\nHe had applied both his Harden skill, as well as his Acid Resistance to his armor, yet the condition of his armor wasn’t good. It was due to already having fought the Great Slime. If it kept going like this, his armor wouldn’t even last a few more minutes and would disappear without a trace!\n’Damn it.’\nAt the end of his brief pondering, he put his armor into his inventory. Even if he were to die once, he couldn’t afford to lose his armor in a place like this.\n[Kyahak, Kyahahak!]\nThe Ghoul saw Lee Shin Woo de-equip his armor, and even as its hands consecutively floundered in the air, it laughed. Though he didn’t know what it was so happy about, the Ghoul’s body was being gradually burned by the Flames of Revenge. He didn’t know if the Ghoul realized that it was in the exact same position as he was.\n’Now it’s become us both having time bombs set up and we’re just waiting for whoever’s time bomb goes off first.’\nLee Shin Woo, even while furrowing his (nonexistent) brow, decided to make his next move. It was none other than himself who made up his mind to finish this quest, even if he had to risk his life to do so.\nThis was the time to stake his life. Even though he knew its body was damn tough, or that it was extremely strong, he needed to get one hit in with his sword...\n-Kwang!\n[Ggueeehk!]\nSomething forcefully hit the Acid Ghoul, causing it to miserably roll onto the floor. Lee Shin Woo, who had charged at it, stiffened in place.\n\"I’ll help you!\"\nThe one who had struck the Acid Ghoul, and appeared in its place was... a Skeleton Horse, and it spoke with eyes ablaze with blue goblin fire. Its voice was neither low, nor high, but simply just a charming, beautiful voice.\nThe Skeleton Horse spoke in that beautiful voice, so he thought there was a considerable disparity between them, but when he thought about it, he wasn’t in much of a different situation.\n\"To think there’d be another undead hero like me...! It’s really nice to meet you!\"\n\"...\"\nLee Shin Woo was speechless when he heard the Skeleton Horse continue, and kept his mouth shut. He had, at some point, heard about a Skeleton Horse in the chatting channel, a horse that just kept running within the confines of the underground empire; and the stories regarding the Skeleton Horse had coursed through his head.\nYeah, his seniors were right. There was no way that an undead wouldn’t attack humans and would just keep running.\n... If they weren’t a hero, that is.",

    "content": "<Chapter 7. Three way - 3>\nA skeleton and a skeleton horse; both of them were heroes at that. They definitely had much to say to the other. ’What the hell did you ask God for’, or ’Were you perhaps a horse to start’, etc...\nHowever, it wasn’t the best situation for them to introduce themselves. Lee Shin Woo suppressed the urge to grab hold of and interrogate it, and he spoke simply to the Skeleton Horse, which (probably) looked at him as if it wanted something.\n\"Thanks for helping. Shall we talk about the rest after taking that bastard down?\"\n\"A-Alright!\"\nThe Skeleton Horse’s reply seemed slightly anxious, but he didn’t have time to be concerned about that. Right now, the only thing Lee Shin Woo was sure about was that the Skeleton Horse had equal strength to the Ghoul, such that it could ram into it and send it flying. There wasn’t a more dependable ally than a level 4!\n[Kugaaaaaah! Again, you’re nothing but bones...!]\nMeanwhile, the Ghoul, which had rolled onto the ground from the Skeleton Horse’s kick, realized the identity of its attacker, and seemed to become extremely angry. Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on NoveI[F]ire.net\nHowever, the moment its temper flared, and it tried to upright its body, Lee Shin Woo used his Catapult; his index finger flew and burrowed deep into the Ghoul’s forearm. Right as the Ghoul opened its eyes wide, the finger exploded!\n\"Go now, attack!\"\n[Kahak...!]\nLee Shin Woo aimed for the moment the Ghoul rolled onto the floor again, and activated his Combat Sprint, quickly advancing towards it. Through his Self-Destruct, about half of its forearm was severed, and he followed up by striking its other half with his Bone of Thunder Lasting.\nIt was a Power Slash backed by Bursting Thunder! It looked akin to a blue streak of lightning.\n[Critical Hit!]\n[Kuaaaaaaahk!]\nNo matter how far apart their levels, the Ghoul wouldn’t come out unscathed after receiving a Catapult, Self-Destruct, and the following Power Slash. As soon as its tough and sturdy forearm rolled onto the floor, it screamed awfully.\n\"Eeek, Die!\"\nThe Skeleton Horse rushed over, and kicked it once again. It didn’t seem like it had used a skill, but since it had rushed over frighteningly quickly, despite the short distance, its attack power was considerable. Just...\n’Why is it so clumsy?’\nLee Shin Woo had consumed countless skeleton and monster bones, leveled up, and gained their combat abilities, so from his point of view, the Skeleton Horse moved crudely, even when considering the difference in species. Moreover, after its preemptive attack, it looked distressed as the Acid Ghoul’s blood splattered, which was mixed with Acid Poison; he definitely looked like a newbie.\n’Wait, high leveled heroes could be newbies. Moreover, since there’s no way that it used to be a horse, it may be natural that it hasn’t gotten used to its body yet.’\nHe decided he would calmly talk this over after the battle’s conclusion. In any case, toppling the Acid Ghoul was his top priority. Lee Shin Woo yelled at the Skeleton Horse, which was going for another attack even while suffering from the Ghoul’s Acid Poison.\n\"Stay back for now, unless you have a skill or equipment that repels Acid Poison!\"\n\"But...\"\n\"I’m not telling you to run away. When I ask you, attack him then!\"\n\"...Got it!\"\nFortunately, the Skeleton Horse meekly obeyed Lee Shin Woo and retreated. He wouldn’t have an answer if someone unskilled decided to be stubborn, but it seemed like he had avoided the worst case scenario.\n[You ridiculous bastards, I’ll crush you into powder!]\nRight then, the Ghoul stood up. It gripped its severed arm with its other hand and dangerously swung it. Whenever it swung it, a thicker Acid Poison spread out. It was mixed with the blazing flames on its entire body, so it gave off a smoky smell.\n[You have been intensively exposed to the Acid Ghoul’s strengthened Acid Poison. Though Low Rank Acid Resistance is lessening the damage, it seems like it is not very effective!]\n\"Ugh... Yeah, I’ll cut off your other arm for you soon.\"\n[A mere feeble skeleton...!]\nEven while saying that, the Ghoul seemed to regard Lee Shin Woo as a much more dangerous opponent than his exterior appearance might suggest, and moved warily.\nTo the point that he felt as though its combat experience when it was alive was immense, especially because it swung its arm as a weapon, and stayed a reasonable distance away.\n[Heh...]\n\"!?\"\nHowever, thinking like that was a miscalculation. It aimed for that split second where Lee Shin Woo couldn’t move hastily, and shoved the arm in its hand into its gigantic mouth.\n[Kuaaaaaah!]\n\"You crazy...\"\nLee Shin Woo, who realized at that moment that the Ghoul’s mana had increased explosively, regretted that he hadn’t already severed its other arm. Then again, he obviously couldn’t afford to, nor did he have the time to do so before.\n\"You dirty bastard!\"\n[I’m a Ghoul, you stupid skeleton!]\nJust because it ate its arm didn’t mean that another arm would grow in its place.\nHowever, the moment it swallowed its own arm, the skin which had been blazing with the Flames of Revenge, immediately returned to its normal state, and not only that, his other remaining arm swelled fatly. It naturally felt as though the Ghoul’s strength had increased a level.\n\"You asshole, you’re not even a boss, yet you’re starting the second phase...!\"\n[Die!]\nAfter it finished consuming its arm, the Ghoul charged at Lee Shin Woo. It was astonishingly fast, so much so that it was incomparable to before!\nLee Shin Woo didn’t act with reckless bravado, and immediately activated his Combat Sprint. However, when he thought he’d gotten far enough away, the Ghoul’s arm strangely lengthened and smashed him!\n\"Urgh!\"\n[Kyahahak!]\nThis is where it seized the momentum. It pursued Lee Shin Woo, who was rolling on the floor, and attacked him again.\n[Die! Break!]\n\"Tch, keuhut...!\"\nLee Shin Woo trusted his intuition and rolled onto the floor, avoiding the Ghoul’s arm, which it swung like a whip; though whenever its arm crashed into the ground, the wildly spurting Acid Poison was indirectly melting his body.\n[Low Rank Acid Resistance has become Lv3.]\nThe fact that his Low Rank Acid Resistance, which had risen to low rank just a little while ago, was leveling up, proved just how extreme his environment was.\nHowever, the situation wasn’t great, so he couldn’t be happy about the skill leveling up. Lee Shin Woo regenerated his body while out of breath, and grit his teeth. Maintaining his Flames of Revenge was continuously taxing his mana, and now, he didn’t really have much mana to spare.\n’Should I call the Skeleton Horse now? No, he’ll just get even more hurt. ...Then.’\nIt was time to use the method he had been saving to turn the situation around. Lee Shin Woo mentally braced himself again and kicked off the floor, using his Combat Sprint. He leaped up into the air as the Acid Ghoul’s arm came flying towards him! He activated Harden, applying it to both of his arms, and held tightly onto the arm.\n[Heut!]\nThe Acid Ghoul seemed to think that Lee Shin Woo had given up his life, as it sported a wicked smile, and pulled him towards it.\nDespite him activating his Harden skill, his arms started to gradually melt, but he didn’t have any intention of using Regeneration. He calmly waited for the moment he got close. The moment the Ghoul was sure of its victory was the best time for a comeback! Good, in exchange for a life, he’ll grab hold of victory...\n\"Ei... Eit!\"\n’This timing again!?’\nHowever, when Lee Shin Woo had resolved himself, someone else interfered. To be exact, a javelin quickly cut through the air, and pierced the Acid Ghoul’s arm.\n[Kuaaaaaahk!]\nThe effect was amazing! The spear burrowed deep into the Ghoul’s arm, and when the Acid Ghoul contracted its arm, it was tormented by a horrific pain, due to the deep tear wound.\nIt was really impressive, especially when the sharp mana at the tip of the spear impacted the ghoul, and spread everywhere.\n\"Huhp!\"\n[Kuhwak!]\nWhile Lee Shin Woo stood in awe, another javelin holding mana flew and burrowed into the Ghoul’s arm. It was a speed and accuracy that gave him goosebumps! When he figured out who had thrown the javelins, he laughed forcefully.\n’Ye Jin Jin?’\nIt was none other than Ye Jin Jin. He thought she had run off on her own since he hadn’t seen her, but she hadn’t.\n\"Hoo, hoo...\"\nShe was still wearing rags instead of clothes, and she looked as though she would immediately collapse and start crying at any time, but she pursed her lips and endured; after that, she prepared to throw another javelin, and it actually didn’t seem like she was going to run away.\nHe honestly looked again. ’Even when rotten, it’s still a herring.’ At least at this very moment, her gaze befitted that of a hero.\n[Prey!]\n\"Where do you think you’re going?\"\nNow that it’s become like this, the situation’s changed. There was the Skeleton Horse, while sloppy, which possessed a level 4’s strength, as well as the coward that was only level 3, but was a hero with a talent in throwing... He had a chance of winning now without giving up one of his precious lives.\n\"Hubp!\"\n[Kuhak!?]\n[Beginner Power Slash has become Lv8. The activation speed of the skill has become faster.]\nBefore he was flung to the ground, Lee Shin Woo exerted all his strength to twist its arm, and then rolled onto the ground. He wondered whether he could utilize Power Slash with his body as well, so he had tried it, and it seemed like he had half succeeded.\n[You insect, how dare you!]\n\"Heut, hey you!\"\n\"Y-Yes!\"\nLee Shin Woo avoided the infuriated Acid Ghoul’s Acid Poison particles and retreated, calling out to the hero, Ye Jin Jin. He couldn’t pretend like he couldn’t talk at this point, and he didn’t have a reason not to either. It seemed as though Ye Jin Jin didn’t think she was in a position to discriminate about this or that, as she obediently responded.\n\"How many more times can you shoot that!?\"\n\"Two more times!\"\n\"If I give a location, shoot it right away!\"\n\"Yes...!\"\n[I won’t let you!]\n\"Ha!\"\nPerhaps the spears were quite painful, as it immediately aggroed onto Ye Jin Jin. It even ignored Lee Shin Woo and ran towards Ye Jin Jin, but Lee Shin Woo directly blocked its path. On his left raised hand, a black flame blazed.\n\"Why don’t you try blocking this one?\"\n[Not a... chance!]\nLee Shin Woo’s finger trembled, and the instant he made the motion for his Catapult, the Ghoul appeared to perfectly read its trajectory and swung its arm! However, it didn’t feel anything ever touch its hand.\n[Kuha...?]\n\"It was a fake, you dumbass!\"\nThe moment that the Ghoul felt quizzical, Lee Shin Woo was already drifting in the air, aiming his index finger at the Ghoul. He had taken the opportunity when its vision was obscured from swinging its arm and jumped.\n[Kuahk!?]\nThe Ghoul noticed him, but it was much too late to withdraw its arm. When it opened its mouth wide to shriek, Lee Shin Woo launched his index finger bone without delay!\n[The Beginner Catapult skill has advanced to Low Rank. Agility has increased by 5. Continuous Catapults have become possible.]\n[Kuaaaaaahk! I’ll kill you!]\nLee Shin Woo exploded his index finger the moment it lodged into the Ghoul’s head. Despite the Ghoul losing 20% of its head, its stance didn’t falter and swung its arm at Lee Shin Woo.\nIt staggered a bit from the various injuries it had sustained, but the brutal force within its arm was still the same as ever, and soared through the air with an unpleasant piercing power.\n’Damn it...’\nIf he could, he would’ve shot bullets continuously like the Ratman, but he lacked the mana to do so. He could use it twice more, and if he wanted the scale to be even bigger, he could only use it once more. Lee Shin Woo couldn’t afford to waste that chance now, and as he fell down powerlessly, he grit his teeth and yelled out.\n\"Help me!\"\n\"I was waiting!\"\nIts spirit was like Superman’s. He didn’t even know where he came from; the Skeleton Horse appeared with a speed that made it seem like it could even dodge lightning, and like it had done before, forcefully rammed into the Ghoul!\n[Kugaahk!]\n\"Hoo.\"\nThe Ghoul, which had aggroed onto Lee Shin Woo, foolishly suffered from the same type of attack as before, and rolled onto the floor. Lee Shin Woo used that opportunity to land safety.\n’Still, we can’t kill him like this.’\nLee Shin Woo put his sword into his inventory, took a deep breath, and scrutinized the Acid Ghoul. Despite the Ghoul experiencing the bone shot wreathed with Flames of Revenge, the javelin throw, and even the Skeleton Horse’s weighty, full strength charge attack one after another, it still stood up in the end.\n\"Go ahead and rest now. I’ll finish this and come back.\"\n\"I came over to help... Sorry.\"\n\"No, you did enough.\"\nIt had probably been affected by the Acid Poison when it collided with the Ghoul, so its once dignified appearance had definitely lessened quite a bit compared to before. Still, it was worth it. It had not only saved Lee Shin Woo’s life, but it had created a deadly opening for him.\n\"You, over there!\"\n\"My name is Ye Jin Jin!\"\nHe only hardened his left arm, and as he looked sharply at the Ghoul that stumbled as it stood up, called for Ye Jin Jin. She had already taken out another javelin and looked really nervous, but she was already ready to throw the next one.\n\"Ready?\"\n\"Yes!\"\n\"Good, then... let’s go!\"\nLee Shin Woo immediately used his Combat Sprint, kicked off the floor, and charged at the Ghoul. At that moment, the Ghoul seemed to be making a last-ditch effort and forcefully spewed its Acid Poison in all directions. Even while it was under the effects of the Flames of Revenge, it moved as if unhindered and Lee Shin Woo likewise ignored the Acid Poison, and charged.\nHis ribs and legs melted, but his hardened left arm was still intact. At the very least, he wouldn’t fall before he reached it.\n[Guwaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\nThe Ghoul looked as though it had lost all reason and sensitively responded to Lee Shin Woo’s charge. Its arm dreadfully wriggled and sucked in all the Acid Poison in the vicinity, and it shot that gathered Acid Poison directly at Lee Shin Woo! It looked as if he had shot a laser beam.\n\"Arm!\"\n\"Hubp!\"\nEven to the very end, the Ghoul possessed an attack that he hadn’t anticipated; were all level 4 and up elite monsters like this? But it didn’t matter. Ye Jin Jin’s preparations were all for a situation like this.\n[Kuhak!]\nAs soon as he gave the command, Ye Jin Jin threw her javelin, piercing its arm, and the trajectory of the Acid Poison twisted significantly.\nThe Acid Poison spread through the entire area and the sight of the ground melting away was truly horrific, but the sprinting Lee Shin Woo remained fixed on the Ghoul. Lee Shin Woo approached within firing range and briefly yelled.\n\"Head!\"\n\"Haht!\"\nYe Jin Jin’s spear throwing technique was almost like a work of art. The instant he had yelled out, her javelin flew sharply like an awl, and burrowed into the Ghoul’s wide open mouth which was facing Lee Shin Woo! It was probably trying to spew out its Acid Poison through its mouth, but the timely spear throw from Ye Jin Jin stopped it.\n[Guahk! Ahgaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!]\n\"I’ll let you eat those bones you hate so much!\"\nLee Shin Woo shoved his left arm into its fixed mouth with all his strength! His hardened arm cut through rotten flesh and muscle. The instant his arm burrowed deep within its head, the Ghoul opened its eyes wide and bit down. It had instinctually acted like that, as all it had left were malice and wickedness.\n[Guaaaaaaaaah!]\n\"Self-Destruct!\"\nAnd that right there was the moment that Lee Shin Woo had been waiting for.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 7 part4",
    "content": "<Chapter 7. Three way - 4>\n- Kwaaaaang!\nThis was the greatest impact he’d experienced since being dropped into the Empire. The sound of the explosion, the shock, and above all, the pressure that struck his entire body; he wasn’t able to resist and Lee Shin Woo rolled raggedly onto the ground.\nIt just hurt, and hurt some more. The moment his arm had been severed, as well as the moment a huge explosion occurred, he felt pain that transcended the limits of his perception. Despite only aiming for the Ghoul and activating the skill, it felt as though there were several dozens of holes perforating his body.\n[The Low Rank Self-Destruct skill has become Lv2. Magic has increased by 1. The force of the explosion increases.]\nHowever, he was sure of its effectiveness. The fact that everything above the Ghoul’s neck had cleanly disappeared from the Ghoul’s body was proof of that.\n[Gu... aaah...]\nNo, to be exact, it wasn’t a corpse yet. Despite it losing its head, it was still alive. It was filled with wounds, and flailed its arm about; seeing it fumbling around the floor to find Lee Shin Woo, the culprit that made it this way, made him feel goosebumps. From its throat, of which around half was remaining, a truly grotesque voice trickled out.\n\"Hoo...\"\n\"Heup!\"\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo resolved himself, and when he was about to grip his weapon, the Skeleton Horse appeared like lightning and struck the Ghoul, dropping its front legs onto it. It was so powerful that he thought that this was what Thor’s lightning hammer might be like!\n[Gu...]\nThe Ghoul wasn’t even able to spread its Acid Poison and was stuck in that area, wriggling around a couple of times. In the end, it stopped moving, and the battle was over.\n[You have commanded different individual species and successfully hunted a monster a higher level than you. All stats have increased by 2. Beginner Command has become Lv7.]\n[This is a term that only those who have been saved, not the one who saves, can speak. You have acquired the Savior’s karma token with great success. Strength and magic have increased by 4. You have acquired the active skill, Sacrifice Lv1.]\n[You have superbly succeeded in executing your revenge. The Beginner Avenger skill has become Lv4. When you meet the one who defeated you again, all abilities increase by 30%.]\nWas it because the Ghoul persistently hung on until the very end? Despite the message that the party had successfully hunted the Ghoul, Lee Shin Woo couldn’t believe it and just blankly stood there.\nHowever, he did so only briefly. When the Ghoul turned into mana and disappeared, leaving behind the dropped items in its place, reality hit him. None of them had died, and had amazingly defeated the monster.\n\"...We won.\"\n\"It’s all because of you.\"\n\"It was all because you appeared at the right moment that we were able to win so easily.\"\nThe Undead Hero and the Skeleton Horse Hero exchanged compliments. Truthfully, they both didn’t even have the energy to stand, but while fighting against the Ghoul, the ground had become completely covered by the Acid Poison, so they barely endured, and stood.\n\"T-Thank you very much!\"\n\"Oh...\"\nAnd the last remaining hero cut in. It was none other than Ye Jin Jin, who was dressed in tattered clothing. Of course, Lee Shin Woo had indeed saved her, but he hadn’t expected her to bow her head in front of an undead and even thank him... It was honestly something he hadn’t expected. It was only really possible if one was extremely pure.\n\"This was the first time I’ve realized that there are also good Undead in the Empire! I-I was really about to die... Thank you very much for helping me!\"\n\"Hm?\"\nHowever, at that time, the Skeleton Horse tilted its head, and then, turned its head towards Lee Shin Woo, and asked.\n\"You weren’t the one who was in danger? The quest or whatever definitely said that there was a hero who was in trouble, and when I got here, you were fighting with that Ghoul...\"\n\"No, I also received the quest and came to save her.\"\n\"Huh? You came to save... me? Wait, just a second. A hero...?\"\nThe misunderstandings that the party had were all meshed together in the same place. Lee Shin Woo had roughly grasped the situation, but the Skeleton Horse, and Ye Jin Jin looked as though they couldn’t understand what was going on at all.\nWould they be able to understand each other just by talking? Lee Shin Woo sighed and spoke briefly.\n\"Let’s talk in a calm and orderly way. Ah, before that, wear some clothes.\"\n\"Clothes...? Ggyaahk!\"\n[Quest complete!]\n[You have acquired 50,000 Perium.]\n[Strength has increased by 5, Agility by 10, Health by 3, and Magic by 7.]\n[You have acquired 3 permits to God’s secret shop, the Intermediate Ice Resistance skill book, and 5 Lv3 equipment reinforcement permits.]\nNow this was definitely a quest reward. He had acquired 50,000 Perium, and secondly, he had gained a total of 25 stats! He had inwardly been looking forward to the skill book, and was disappointed that it was an Ice Resistance skill book, but even when he considered that, it was truly a shocking reward.\n\"To think that both of you were heroes... God just granted your wish, yet you became an undead.\"\nLee Shin Woo checked his rewards and when he sported a satisfied expression, Ye Jin Jin (she had safely changed) looked on disbelievingly, alternating between the two. The Skeleton Horse noticed her disbelief and spoke somewhat bitterly.\n\"You probably won’t understand what I say, but I don’t know what she did to me. I don’t know what happened to my brain...\"\nRather than something like supernatural powers or a miracle, he spoke as if he had experienced a taste of something far worse, and Lee Shin Woo nodded his head in agreement.\nOf course, he realized that he was too greedy, but still, he hadn’t thought that she would just abruptly turn him into a skeleton. It if weren’t for the sense of composure that was forced upon him by becoming a skeleton, it would’ve also been difficult for him to bear.\n\"It might be difficult to believe me, but... just trust me when I say that I, as well as this guy, are your allies.\"\n\"I trust you. If you think about it, it would’ve been difficult for you to save me at that precise timing had you not been heroes. It’s just...\"\nYe Jin Jin wavered, and then, quietly added.\n\"It seems like it was really difficult for you.\"\n\"...\"\nThere was no doubt about that, but the meaning differs depending on how it’s said. Lee Shin Woo was momentarily speechless when he heard Ye Jin Jin’s simple, honest, and careful words.\nHe felt slightly, extremely slightly guilty that he had acted in order to receive the reward, rather than save this girl. Rather, he felt happy about those emotions.\n\"You’re a good kid.\"\n\"Not really. ...But what good does it do me? Strength is everything in the Empire.\"\n\"You’re the same level as me.\"\n\"I just feel more shameless hearing that.\"\nThey had already finished their introductions. Lee Shin Woo’s lie that he was level 4 had been exposed, but since it’d been revealed that he was an undead already, it didn’t really matter anymore. Honestly, it didn’t really matter if they figured it out, but if they weren’t in a special situation like Ye Jin Jin, his seniors wouldn’t easily accept that he was an undead hero, so he had been pushing it back.\n\"I’m level 4, but I’m weaker than you. So it’s alright.\"\n\"Jin, that’s...\"\n\"You said you were level 4 ever since you became a Skeleton Horse, right?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n’Jin’ was none other than the Skeleton Horse. He was obviously a human before, not a horse.\nIn his original world, Jin was a sprinter, and had answered like this when God asked him what he desired.\n’I just want to keep running, faster than anyone else.’ The rıghtful source is novel⦿fire.net\nNo matter how he thought about it, God was definitely crazy. To grant that request, she turned him into an undead, and a horse at that!\nLee Shin Woo could accept that she turned him into a skeleton and could even understand why, but turning Jin into a Skeleton Horse made him want to ask God, ’Do you really want the heroes to fight off the Empire?’\n\"So you’re saying you just continuously ran, huh. Without even clearing a single quest?\"\n\"Yeah. I don’t know how long it’s been since I’ve been dropped onto this world, but I don’t get exhausted, hungry, thirsty, or even tired, and I didn’t know what to do, nor did I want to fight monsters... I just ran. I didn’t even know about the chatting channel, and until I received this quest, I didn’t even know that there were other heroes.\"\nIf one were to make a wish and the next morning become a Skeleton Horse, they would obviously be stunned. He just felt that it was frightening that Jin relieved all that stress just by running.\nHe didn’t know about anything else, but Jin had probably grown considerably in sprint related skills. He could completely understand his acceleration speed in such a short distance, as well as the force of the tackle that followed.\nOn the other hand, since he hadn’t fought a monster face-to-face even once before, the fact that he responded so sloppily in a combat scenario was natural... Lee Shin Woo, who had some sort of pride in being the one amongst the heroes that had the most unusual history, meekly passed over the crown to Jin.\n\"That’s why I think you’re really amazing. You said you’ve only been here for 3 weeks? I don’t know how you became such an experienced warrior in just 3 weeks...\"\n\"He’s right. That sword strike, or that shot were really...\"\nIt was undeniable that Lee Shin Woo had played a crucial role in hunting the Acid Ghoul, but... he turned away as the two looked at him as if his face were golden. Just in time, he saw the loot that was rolling on the ground.\nYe Jin Jin, who checked which way his head had turned, smiled ambiguously and took a step back.\n\"Ah, the loot... I’ll sit this out. Since you guys saved me...\"\n\"Please take some, based on how much you contributed with your javelins. You have to be the one that handles the karma that you’ve sown.\"\n\"...It’s really only been 3 weeks since you’ve first been here, right?\"\nShe couldn’t believe what she was hearing; it seemed as though Lee Shin Woo knew much more about the truth of this world than she did, and had to ask back. Of course, it turned out exactly as Lee Shin Woo had said. There was only one monster and there were individual drops for each of them, but how their splits would be shared was already determined.\n[23,510 Perium]\n[Acid Ghoul’s Thumbnail]\n[Lv4 Acid Skull Helm]\n70% of the total Perium was deducted from his share, but he got two items.\nThough he was able to acquire new information that this world did indeed recognize nails as bones due to the Acid Ghoul’s Thumbnail (a skeleton doesn’t have nails, but they honestly don’t need them), but there was something more important than that.\n[Acid Skull Helm]\n[Lv4]\n[Durability: 1,500/1,500]\n[Defense: 250 - 310]\n[Options: Magic + 10, Effectiveness of Acid Type Skills + 10%]\n\"A helmet made of its skull; this is really valuable...\"\n\"It’s a level 4 helmet... I’m really jealous.\"\n\"Wow, it’s really tough.\"\nLee Shin Woo as well as the other two began touching the pale green and sleek helmet, and couldn’t stop from being moved.\nIt was beautiful, to the point that he couldn’t believe that it was made of bone. It started from the neck, and completely protected the head; there wasn’t a separate visor attached, but there was a small crack that he could see through.\n’An undead’s head is central to their life. There isn’t much to think about; it’s more important than body armor.’\nHe equipped the helmet at that very spot. Compared to the Dire Wolf Bone Armor, which increased his health by 20, it seemed like the additional 10 magic didn’t compare, but it had other options besides that.\nThe effectiveness of acid types skills would increase by 10%. It wasn’t just a valuable option because it would increase the effectiveness of his Acid Resistance...\n’It’ll probably help with the skill that I gain from the Acid Ghoul’s Thumbnail, too... Yeah. I have to absorb that quickly as well.’\nHe turned around and spoke to the black haired girl, and Jin, who were conversing quietly.\n\"The battle’s over and you’re safe now, so I’ll get going.\"\n\"Ah.\"\nIt seemed as though Ye Jin Jin hadn’t expected him to say that, as her complexion became ashen, but soon, she nodded her head stiffly. He also had things to think about after this incident. At the very least, he hoped that he wouldn’t be negligent during battle or have to roll onto the floor again in the future.\n\"Thank you very much for saving my life. I’ll probably greet you again in the chatting channel, but let’s definitely meet again in the future.\"\n\"Alright, as long as you don’t die, we should be able to see each other again.\"\n\"Let’s meet again.\"\nThe Skeleton Horse, Jin, also said his farewells to Ye Jin Jin. Honestly, Lee Shin Woo had somewhat been expecting that.\nHe smiled slightly and turned around. Jin also turned his body in a similar direction. Ye Jin Jin then shouted at them as loud as she could.\n\"I’ll help you next time!\"\n\"Say that after you get stronger.\"\nLee Shin Woo walked quietly until he couldn’t see Ye Jin Jin anymore. He was trying to get back to the underground tunnel he had dug up to return to the dungeon.\n\"So.\"\nHowever, before he found the underground tunnel, Lee Shin Woo suddenly paused, and opened his (nonexistent) mouth.\n\"Shall we start talking?\"\n\"Sounds good.\"\nJin, who had been quietly following behind, replied in a beautiful voice that didn’t at all match with his exterior appearance.\n\"I was waiting.\"",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 8 part1",
    "content": "<Chapter 8. Elite Dungeon - 1>\n\"I felt it this time. That I can’t just go on like this...\"\nThat was the first thing Jin said.\n\"Running was everything to me in my past life, but continuing to just run in this world is... nothing more than escapism. That’s what I felt when I saw you and Jin Jin.\"\n\"Well, probably.\"\nLee Shin Woo agreed, uninterested. Of course, because of that, his running related skills had increased, but that’s just a by-product of him escaping reality. In order to survive in this world, and in order to advance forward... one needed to fight.\n\"Tell me. How did you... even after becoming an undead, so quickly adapt to this world and proceed forward? And if you can, please help me so I can become like that too.\"\n\"For free?\"\n\"No!\"\nJin strongly shook his head, but it seemed like he was really hesitating with his follow up. Lee Shin Woo had already roughly anticipated Jin’s request, so he could understand his hesitation.\nHow long did he wait like that? Jin sighed deeply, and spoke.\n\"...I’ll let you ride on my back. It should be helpful for travel as well as battle, right?\"\n\"In other words, it’s an offer to party up.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nJin was originally a human. For him to have offered to let someone else ride on his back must’ve caused him to give up a lot of things.\nIt was no different from him throwing away precious evidence that he was human. He was willing to go that far in order to advance further.\n\"It seems like it’s way worse for me, but... yeah, your speed is definitely helpful. Honestly, I did need someone to talk to. Alright, let’s work together.\"\n\"Then... gaah!?\"\nJin sounded relieved, yet he saw Lee Shin Woo straighten his index finger. Jin, who had seen this very index finger burrow into the Acid Ghoul and explode, couldn’t help but flinch.\n\"Still, accepting you without any hesitation right now isn’t best for either of us.\"\n\"Then?\"\n\"Here.\"\nLee Shin Woo passed Jin a tattered sack. Jin obediently accepted it and tilted his head while holding it in his teeth. Lee Shin Woo smiled faintly and spoke.\n\"If you hunt skeletons or undead like zombies, they usually drop Perium and bones. Come back after filling that sack to the brim with bones. That’s my condition.\"\n\"...?\"\nThe blue goblin fire, that acted as substitutes for his eyes, shook strongly, as if expressing his doubt. To think that it was possible to express his emotions through goblin fire; Lee Shin Woo was extremely jealous of that. When he becomes level 4, will goblin fire fill his empty eye sockets?\n\"It’s all for your sake, so fill the sack. The higher the monster’s level, the better.\"\n\"But... ugh, I got it. So it’s a test.\"\nIt seemed like Jin was definitely misunderstanding. He thought Lee Shin Woo was testing him, testing whether he had the right to accompany him, or checking if he had the resolve to hunt monsters.\nOf course, when Bone Reinforcement became level 4, he became able to apply it to others as well, so he just planned to use all the bones that Jin gathered to strengthen him all at once, imparting the undead’s knowledge and experiences onto him.\n\"You’ll definitely be able to become as experienced as me in no time.\"\n\"That sounds impossible, but... I got it. I’ll show you that I wasn’t ignoring those undead until now because I was scared.\"\nPerhaps it was because he was an athlete in his past life, as Jin’s spirit was considerable. The experience of taking down the Acid Ghoul may have instilled him with confidence.\n\"Come back here once you’ve filled it to the brim. Ah, if you can, do some quests. Since doing quests is the only way to unlock things like the inventory or the chatting channel.\"\n\"I got it. Ah, and also take this.\"\nJin stuck out his neck. There was a small pouch hanging on his neck, and after taking it off, Lee Shin Woo found 50,000 Perium inside, as well as 5 Lv3 Equipment Reinforcement permits.\n\"It’s just what I got as the quest reward, but it’s useless to me. It’s cumbersome, so you take it.\"\nIt seems like the skill book had already disappeared, as he learned the skill, but it seems like he couldn’t do anything with these. Since Lee Shin Woo wasn’t the type to refuse something offered, he immediately took them.\n\"It should be fine to take this in advance, considering what I’m going to do for you in the future.\"\n\"Hmm...?\"\n\"No, it’s nothing.\"\nIt’s likely that Jin still wasn’t familiar with ’karma’. Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and shook his head. Since he didn’t have a clear understanding of karma, he wouldn’t understand, even if Lee Shin Woo tried explaining it to him with words.\n\"Then get going. If you can, try to get level 2 bones or higher. That’ll be good for you, too.\"\n\"No matter how bad I am at fighting, I should be able to take them down if they’re level 2... I got it. As soon as I fill the sack, I’ll come back.\"\n\"Ok.\"\nJin nodded his head for some time, turned around, and then ran straight forward. His speed was greater than any monster’s that he had encountered since being dropped into the Empire. With that speed, even if he were to meet the Acid Ghoul again, he wouldn’t die.\nIn an instant, he was unable to see Jin’s appearance, and soon after, Lee Shin Woo activated Bone Reinforcement on the Acid Ghoul’s Thumbnail.\n[By sacrificing the Acid Ghoul’s Thumbnail, both hands are reinforced. Strength and Health have increased by 3, and Magic by 5. Absorbing a portion of the Acid Ghoul’s memories and experiences.]\n[This... this is... This seems like the wrong method, Doctor. This isn’t it. This test is a failure! We can’t stop it...! - Edward L. Baker]\n\"...This is...\"\nThe amount of stats was also immense, but when he felt the flowing memories, he felt cold, as if he had just swallowed a block of ice whole.\nThis was a record of their struggle. A record of their struggle to not become undead...!\n’So that’s how it was. They realized that they wouldn’t be able to prevent the curse that ruined the Empire, and they researched for a method to not become the undead. However, they failed... and instead, they put their hands on poison, and as a result, became a zombie that spurts Acid Poison.’\nThere was something he thought of when talking about poison and zombies. Hadn’t he obtained a deteriorated Poison Zombie’s bone in the sewers? Moreover, the slimes bore poison as well... As soon as he wondered whether there was something remaining in the sewers that connected the two, he couldn’t sit still at all.\n\"However, before that.\"\nLee Shin Woo had suddenly acquired 10 Lv3 Equipment Reinforcement permits, and used one of them to reinforce the Dire Wolf’s Bone Armor. The armor, which looked as though it would break any minute now, instantly returned to its original form, and was reinforced.\n[Dire Wolf Bone Armor +1]\n[Lv3]\n[Durability: 850/850]\n[Defense: 110 - 125]\n[Options: Increases Health by 21] ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ NoveI[F]ire.net\n\"Next up is...\"\nLee Shin Woo prepared for the future, where his equipment would get damaged, and separately stored 1 reinforcement permit. He used the remaining 8 all at once to reinforce his Bone of Thunder Lasting.\nWhile his armor only really possessed the ability to protect his body, his sword had a hidden power related to Bursting Thunder.\n[Bone of Thunder Lasting +8]\n[Lv3]\n[Durability: 1,070/1,070]\n[Attack Power: 260 - 280]\n[Options: Strength + 19, Magic + 19, Effectiveness of Bursting Thunder skill + 18%]\n\"Ooh, Oooooh.\"\nAs expected of a weapon that God herself bestowed (though it had changed); it certainly was different from other weapons. The more he repeated the reinforcement, the more absurdly the attack power grew. It was this strong at +8, and he felt that it had reached values that would enable it to outclass even level 4 weapons!\nAnd that was the same for the stats as well. There was definitely a noticeable difference in strength depending on whether one equipped the weapon or not! It was to the point that around now, he thought that perhaps the true reward for saving a hero were the reinforcement permits.\n’However, since I’ve received something so amazing, if I don’t help that guy considerably, I won’t be able to deal with the shortage of karma. Pleine doesn’t speak idly. It’ll leave a bad taste in my mouth if I’m just on the receiving end.’\nBut, well, that problem should be solved at around the time he meets Jin again. Since he was sure that Bone Reinforcement’s karma wasn’t trifling.\n’Anyway, if he doesn’t have Bone Reinforcement, what skill did he get from God?’\nLee Shin Woo briefly pondered on that subject. It was something he’d realized after being brought into the Empire. Everything had karma, and karma is never something to be taken lightly.\nIn exchange for becoming an undead, he gained 100 lives, as well as a reinforcement ability using bones, so Jin should have gotten something around the same level. Of course, Jin had started at level 4, contrary to Lee Shin Woo, so he probably had to take that into consideration as well.\n’I should ask when he gets back.’\nLee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders, brushed away thoughts regarding Jin, checked the results of his stats, and swung his sword in the air a few times. He trembled, as he felt as though his sword cleaved the air in half, and nodded his head.\nEven though he knew it was ominous, he couldn’t help but mutter like this for the second time.\n\"I’m not afraid of anything anymore...\"\nHe immediately went into the underground tunnel he had dug and returned to the dungeon. He was able to return more quickly and easily than he had anticipated.\n[You possess the dungeon permit. All stats within the dungeon increase by 15.]\n’Now then, let’s completely clear the dungeon before Jin comes back.’\nHowever, as if it were ridiculing his thoughts, the interior of the sewers was extremely silent and dark. Even if there were level 2 slimes crawling around, he trusted that there was nothing unusual going on; but in a different sense, he felt betrayed.\n’Well this is disappointing.’\nHe wanted to familiarize himself with his strengthened body and go wild, but he didn’t feel comfortable with that idea at all. However, the instant he thought so and sighed, he saw something glowing in the darkness.\n[Guooh...]\n\"Hmm?\"\nIt was a sound he’d heard somewhere before. What was it? Before he even organized his thoughts, the dominating sense of danger caused Lee Shin Woo to instinctually dive out of the way. A huge shot hit the ground just a little later! It emitted a horrific sound.\n[Guoooooh!]\n\"You bastard...\"\nAfter Lee Shin Woo figured out the identity of that ’shot’, he simply smiled bitterly and felt dejected. How could he not? This was a Great Slime, an enemy that he had risked his life fighting before finding this passageway.\n[Lv3 Great Slime]\n\"I thought it was the boss before, but now they’re just appearing in the passageway wherever.\"\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t sure if it knew that he had fought one of its kin before, but after it impacted the ground, it rolled into a ball again, and got ready for another leap. However, compared to when he had first faced the Great Slime in the clearing, Lee Shin Woo didn’t really feel that uneasy.\n’I can see its movements better.’\n[Guooooooooh!]\nIt bounced its body quickly and forcefully charged. What’s worse, the slime spun midair and was rotating. He hadn’t noticed that when he had fought the slime from before.\n’However, now I can...!’\nLee Shin Woo moved nimbly, the moment that the slime aimed for him and flew towards him.\nCombat Sprint. It didn’t simply enable one to move fast, it would increase the body’s reaction speed, albeit for a short time. It felt as if he was the only one moving quickly within the slowed time... one’s senses would disappear in the time it would take to say ’ah’, but within that time, Lee Shin Woo moved in the best way possible.\n\"Heup!\"\nHe raised his sword, which he had Hardened, pointed it at the slime, and with the strength of Power Slash behind it, precisely slashed the slime. He couldn’t even think of fighting it straight up before, but this time, he was doing just that.\n\"Ugh...!\"\nOf course, the impact of their collision was tremendous, but he could endure it. His strength stat, which rose to 150 after the dungeon bonus, as well as his equipment bonus, enabled him to stand his ground.\n[Gguoooooh!]\nUltimately, the slime hadn’t inflicted effective damage onto him, and conversely bounced up, colliding with the ceiling. Even though it hadn’t been cleaved by his sword strike, the moment the damaged area impacted with the ceiling, a considerable amount of mucus splattered down.\nThen, an acid mist spread out, but since he had fought the Acid Ghoul, he didn’t even really feel this level of Acid Poison.\n\"Hoo... That was good. Let’s keep going like this.\"\n[Guoh... Guooooh!]\nJust now, he felt it. Rather than fighting weaklings to train, it was naturally better to fight monsters equally as strong as him, or even stronger, in order to get stronger much more quickly.\nLee Shin Woo saw the Great Slime repair its wound, as well as its body becoming smaller, and his eyes gleamed, while once more raising his sword. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to say that around the time that he could comfortably fight a Great Slime face to face without using the Flames of Revenge, he would be qualified to reach level 4, would it?\n\"...I’m going!\"\n[Guuuoooooooh!]\nThe giant slime and the skeleton clashed again. A fierce roar resounded through the dungeon... breathing life into the once silent dungeon.",

    "content": "<Chapter 8. Elite Dungeon - 2>\n[Gureureureureureuk...]\n[You have hunted a Lv3 Great Slime.]\n[You have acquired 9,350 Perium.]\n[You have acquired a Lv2 Old Thorn Bone Spear (+3).]\n[You have acquired a Great Slime Bone Core.]\n\"Hoo, that was easier than I thought it would be.\"\nAfter roughly 10 minutes of intense battle, Lee Shin Woo had emerged victorious in a face-to-face confrontation. Of course, he was injured in the process, but it was to an extent that he could easily heal with only one use of his Regeneration. His equipment was fine as well.\nIn the end, he had used flames in order to squeeze out a core, but by that time it was already dying, so he could safely say that he had killed it with only his sword.\n\"Now, shall we use Bone Rein... Hmm?\"\n[Guuuuuuuuuu!]\n[Guooooooh!]\nThere was a problem that came around the time he finished up the terrific battle and collected the reward. Due to the battle, he had expanded the passageway, and two Great Slimes rushed in all at once!\n[Lv3 Great Slime]\n[Lv3 Great Slime] The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the Novᴇl_Fire(.)net\n\"What the hell...!?\"\nIt was indeed a Lv2 elite dungeon, and he wondered what it would be like if three Lv3 elite monsters had appeared in the same area, but now wasn’t the time to be thinking about that. The Great Slimes were strong enough to break his bone joints the moment he was careless.\n’2 versus 1... I don’t really need to work myself too hard right now.’\nLee Shin Woo quickly made a decision. As soon as they saw him, they went into a frenzy and bounced their bodies around; he avoided their charges, and ignited his Flames of Revenge. While doing so, he suddenly thought ’perhaps it might work’, then attempted to create a flame on both hands, and ended up succeeding!\nOf course, it wasn’t very difficult for him to accurately hit either slimes with the flames. Even if they weren’t Great Slimes and were Emperor Slimes, they wouldn’t be able to avoid the Flames of Revenge’s homing ability!\n[Guuuuuuuuuuu!]\n[Guooooooooh!]\nThe Flames of Revenge were significantly larger than before. Was it due to that? Normally, there would be a delay in between them getting hit by the flame and recognizing the danger, and exploding after, but they didn’t even do that this time and immediately tried to explode!\n\"Heup!\"\nHe made a split second decision and immediately activated his Combat Sprint, leaping high into the sky. Before he collided with the ceiling, he forcefully lodged his sword diagonally; perhaps it was because his body was made of bones or that he was so light, but the sword made no sign of slipping out, allowing him to hang safely. Immediately after, a huge explosion occurred.\n- Kwaaaaang!\n\"Let’s see.\"\nLee Shin Woo hung onto the ceiling and after toughening his feet through Harden, he kicked away all the pieces flying towards him. His feet spun around like a windmill while kicking away the pieces.\nIt was something he himself had done, but it felt like he was watching some kind of movie.\n’I just thought it was a lot better than getting hit, so I tried it, but it actually does work...’\nHis visual acuity had definitely grown as his agility went up. Even when he was level 2, he couldn’t believe it, but now, he could read the trajectory as well as the speed of the pieces, match them, and respond accordingly!\nOf course, he couldn’t kick them all away, so he was hit by a few of them, but that was only about 5% of fragments. And that was no longer at a level that could really hurt him.\n\"Then shall we start in earnest... Hmm?\"\nHowever, when he was confident that had had skillfully handled the explosion, and was about to proceed with his next move, Lee Shin Woo realized that a strangle phenomenon was occurring from below.\nIt was the Great Slimes’ behavior. They were going to explode again!\n’Huh? Now that I think about it, the flames on their bodies aren’t going out...’\nOf course, the Flames of Revenge were tenacious, but all they had to do was tear off the piece that was aflame. Then, why were they still burning?\nThe answer? It was due to their Self-Destruct skills which didn’t discriminate between friend or foe. The fragments that were burning from the Flames of Revenge were spread everywhere, and the other slime that was in close proximity was struck without warning, and began to burn once more!\nAs a result, their bodies shrunk in size and they took damage; what’s worse, the flames were shifted and they began to burn again!\n’...They’re really dumb, aren’t they?’\nHe thought, hanging there vacantly, and while he was thinking, the slimes raised their magic and self-destructed again.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo was still hanging from the ceiling, and was even more easily kicking away the pieces than last time. His Combat Sprint sharpened his senses, so it wasn’t difficult at all.\n[The Low Rank Combat Sprint skill has become Lv6. Agility has increased by 3. You can activate the skill faster, and you can maintain the skill for a longer period of time.]\nAs Lee Shin Woo kicked away the incoming Great Slimes’ fragments, he felt a thrilling pleasure. Did he always like moving his body around this much? It may be the influence of someone else; someone’s bone he had absorbed through Bone Reinforcement.\nWhether it was his original personality or not, he was sure that at some point he began to enjoy personally moving his body and fighting, as well as learning skills through experience. And that personality was something that was extremely beneficial in surviving in the Underground Empire.\n[Gu, Guuooooh...!]\n[Guuuuuu...!]\nAfter completing their second Self-Destruct, rather than completely extinguishing the flames, the flames actually expanded. At around that point, the Great Slimes realized that the situation wasn’t as simple as it would seem.\nLee Shin Woo thought it’d be funny if they repeatedly used their Self-Destruct and died, but it didn’t actually go that way. The slimes, which had focused only on Lee Shin Woo, turned to each other for the first time. They realized that they were the targets of the flames.\n[Guu...]\n[Guuuuuu...!]\nAnd they soon did something astonishing. One of the Great Slime’s mucousy body opened just like a mouth and ate the other one!\nEven as the flames melted their bodies, they softly connected their magic cores together and fused into one whilst emitting sparks; a truly magnificent sight.\n[A Lv3 Great Slime has fused with a similar organism.]\n[Lv3 Great Slime (+3)]\n\"!?\"\nThere was a reinforcing mark on a monster!? Lee Shin Woo was astonished and couldn’t believe the sight. The Great Slimes, which had become one, had become bigger (they would have compressed their mana centrally in their bodies in the process of self-destructing, so their abilities would’ve doubled) and pushed the flames onto the outer portion of its body, self-destructing once more.\nAs a result, it returned to its pristine form once again.\n[Guuuuuuuu!]\nOf course, while it was fusing, Lee Shin Woo had dislodged his sword from the ceiling and dropped down; he activated his Stealth and was already hiding within the darkness, but his sight didn’t leave the fused and strengthened Great Slime.\n’Perhaps the reason that there are Great Slimes in this dungeon is because they’re the result of the originally low leveled slimes repeatedly fusing together over a long period of time.’\nIf that’s the case, then he could understand why this dungeon, which was originally supposed to be level 1, had become an level 2 elite dungeon. Lee Shin Woo had unintentionally come across one of the truths about the dungeon and felt extremely strange.\n[Guuu... Guuu?]\nMeanwhile, the Great Slime (+3) lost Lee Shin Woo and thoroughly searched the passageway while perplexed. Lee Shin Woo matched its movements and repeatedly moved back into hiding, so it couldn’t easily find him.\nThe slime’s senses were so dull that it wouldn’t notice him unless he made a huge noise or there was a huge rush of mana.\n[Guuuuuu...!]\nIt soon gave up on finding Lee Shin Woo and turned around. However, it didn’t appear as though it was returning back to its everyday life.\nIt realized that there was an enemy in the silent sewers and had become more aggressive after fusing. In other words, it was focused on getting stronger in preparation for the next time they met.\n’This has become interesting...’\nLee Shin Woo slowly crawled through the dark passageway and felt conflicted as he watched the back of the slime.\nHe already knew that killing it now would be the safest option. However, if it somehow ’fused’ with all the slimes inhabiting this dungeon... or even just the Great Slimes... he wanted to see the result.\n’It might even become a level 4 elite monster like the Acid Ghoul.’\nOf course, it may not become as strong as the Acid Ghoul, but in any case, if he let it be, a formidable slime would become even more formidable. The risk of dying would increase by that much, yet... Lee Shin Woo couldn’t help but want to see a monster like that be born.\n’It’d obviously be dangerous, but the reward should reflect that danger and be considerable as well.’\nLee Shin Woo already knew the rewards a level 4 elite monster would drop. The rewards that were a level higher than that of a level 3 monster!\nIt wasn’t just the loot. In the process of fighting an enemy of a higher level, all his actions would become a strong karma and would come back to repay him. That’s what happened when he had fought the Acid Ghoul together with the other heroes, too!\nOne would get solo rewards if they fight alone, and if fought with others, they’ll be rewarded together! In this world, levels were an absolute standard, so by exceeding that very standard, he would obtain a ’karma’ that went beyond his imagination.\nAnd that would advance his growth beyond the norm. So much so that he wouldn’t lose to his seniors, or the undead that filled the Empire!\nIf the other heroes heard him, they would ask if he were carrying around a few spare lives and would be amazed; but honestly, he couldn’t help it, he did have extra lives. Several dozen of them at that!\n[You have acquired a target for the Beginner Avenger skill. When you meet again, all abilities increase by 30%.]\nAround the time the Great Slime had went beyond the clearing and disappeared, a message quietly appeared in front of him. Everything was set; he would be able to defeat the evolved slime.\nHe felt really satisfied that he had gotten this skill from his own actions and the resulting karma, rather than anyone else’s bones.\n’And about the Trickster...’\nBy accidentally receiving the Savior karma, he now only needed one more token in the future. At the end of that, what karma would he acquire... he was sure that he wasn’t very far off.\n\"For now... Bone Reinforcement.\"\n[The entire body is reinforced. You have acquired 3 magic. Proficiency in Low Rank Self-Destruct has increased by 10%. Absorbing a portion of the target’s memories and experiences.]\n[Guoooooooooooooh! - Great Slime]\n’Tch, since I’ve risen to level 3, the amount of stats it gives me has decreased...’\nLee Shin Woo, who had finished with the Bone Reinforcement, concluded that it was a good decision to let the Great Slime go, and after nodding his head, started to proceed through the dark sewer passageway. Of course, while maintaining his Low Rank Stealth.",

    "content": "<Chapter 8. Elite Dungeon - 3>\nDid the Great Slime (+3) already wipe out all of the slimes as it passed by? It was so silent that it felt as though his noisy fight at the beginning with the Great Slimes was a lie.\n’Moreover, this place conversely doesn’t have any filth. Ah, was it all melted by the acid?’\nWhen a slime becomes a Great Slime, the acid that its spews out becomes stronger. It would melt solids, and evaporate liquids; the slimes that spew out this horrific acid were crawling around, so it was only natural that the sewers become clean. But around this time, he wondered why the sewer passageway was still left intact.\n’I know it’s tough, but the fact that the preparations were this thorough... perhaps the Empire treated it as though it was natural for slimes to appear in the sewers.’ Thıs content belongs to novel-fire.net\nWhen the Empire flourished, he wondered what it looked like, and suddenly couldn’t get it out of his mind. He would probably never know and... he smiled bitterly (that’s roughly what he imagined his expression was) and continued to explore.\n\"...Hmm?\"\nHowever, while he was exploring, he discovered a crack carved into a portion of the left passageway. When he thoroughly inspected it, he found that the crack was in the shape of a square, and it was a size that could comfortably fit the palm of his hand.\nAnd at the center, he saw the traces of hidden mana. They seemed to be an extremely old.\n’Is this perhaps...’\nIt looked like a fingerprint scanner that showed up in movies... Lee Shin Woo pondered briefly, but soon placed his hand atop the square. Then, the square pattern surprisingly emitted heat and slightly came out. Beyond any doubt, it was a lock!\n\"Hoo...!\"\nLee Shin Woo was excited, thinking that he’d found a secret hidden within the dungeon, and immediately emitted mana, but the reaction wasn’t great. The door lock turned red, and emitted an ominous light, though that was all. Nothing else really changed.\nOf course, he had roughly expected that. It was a lock, so there was no way it’d open by just emitting a bit of mana.\nHowever, be that as it may, he thought that this structure didn’t just respond to a certain individual’s mana alone. That’s because he could faintly, very faintly, feel the traces of mana from a variety of humans that had stood before this very lock.\n’Then... is it a pattern as expected?’\nUnlocking it had now become difficult. It’d probably been dozens of years since the last time this lock was activated, and was so terribly worn out to the point that it’d be difficult to ascertain the origin of the traces of the time worn mana.\nThe saving grace was that there were countless traces of people’s mana, and their strands of mana all overlapped; if he were able to analyze the flow of mana, he felt as though he’d obtain a meaningful result.\n’It’ll probably be a lot of work, but... shall we?’\nThere should still be some time left before the Great Slime cleans up this dungeon. Lee Shin Woo concentrated on the door lock and began to thoroughly analyze the traces of the faintly remaining mana.\n’Figuring out a starting point is important. Yeah, here... No, is it here?’\nHe saw the conditions of opening the lock as follows: draw the mana to the center of the palm, and use that mana to create one pattern. Of course, it wasn’t just that it had to be the same pattern, but it had to flow from the same starting place and end at the same ending place.\nHe genuinely activated his senses and by analyzing the door lock’s release conditions, he found and excluded the false traces that they had purposefully put in. He had fun, as it felt as though he was playing some sort of puzzle game.\n[The Low Rank Magic Accumulation skill has become Lv2. Magic has increased by 2.]\n\"Ah, it goes up.\"\nIt was the same process as when entering a dungeon, so perhaps by just carrying out these tasks, his proficiency in magic related skills would increase.\nLee Shin Woo, who was motivated to improve his skills and stats, didn’t even know how amazing what he was doing was, and continuously analyzed the lock. And then, he finally succeeded in determining the pattern.\n[The Low Rank Magic Affinity skill has become Lv8. Magic has increased by 5.]\n\"It’s a skull. What completely bad taste.\"\nHe knew approximately what the people who had gathered here came for. However, to think that the pattern that they used was a skull; the laughter came out naturally. It definitely should’ve been fairly difficult to get through, though...\n’In any case, I just need to find the starting point and the end point now.’\nThey had gone so far as to hide it in the sewers and even maintain thorough security over it, so he probably wouldn’t get through scot free if he got this wrong. Lee Shin Woo took a deep breath and concentrated even harder on the pattern. To be exact, he concentrated on the flow from the traces of mana that the humans had left behind dozens of years prior. However, there was no way it’d be that simple.\n’Damn it...’\nHe gritted his teeth. Lee Shin Woo thought he might’ve been too arrogant to attempt this, as someone who hasn’t handled mana for very long.\nHowever, despite that, he couldn’t give up at all. In the end, it was pretty much a miracle finding the right pattern. He had no choice but to trust in his talent and concentrate right now...!\n’Ah!’\nLee Shin Woo concentrated more forcefully on the pattern, even more than when he had taken the national college entrance exam, and at that moment, he miraculously succeeded in grabbing a hold of a faintly remaining flow of mana. It was truly a small trace, but it seemed as though some traces of mana were being absorbed into the pattern.\nLee Shin Woo could even go as far as to guess the owner of that mana, and he had very briefly assimilated their experiences... it was none other than the magician, Gerrit, who had burnt and killed his zombified teacher.\n’Wait, it’s the opposite. Since it was a trace from Gerrit, I was able to recognize it. I also experienced sharing a body with him as well, and... more importantly, the fact that Gerrit came here means that this facility is related to General Seagald.’\nHe knew that Gerrit wanted to meet with General Seagald from the memories of the bone he had acquired.\nIt was a facility within the interior of the sewers where they performed some kind of research, and Seagald and Gerrit... He couldn’t be sure of anything yet, but Lee Shin Woo drew a truly persuasive scenario in his head.\n\"Then let’s uncover what the secret is.\"\nSince he had uncovered a trace of the flow of mana, it was easy to find the rest of the traces. In his head, a series of streams of mana were cleanly connected!\n’I got it!’\nHe inwardly yelled with delight and placed his hand carefully on the door lock; and after going through the simulations in his head several times and making sure... reproduced that flow. The slightly black dyed mana slowly and carefully started to create the pattern of a skull.\nEventually, the pattern was completed, and thankfully the door lock didn’t become hot. It emitted a delicate blue light, and soon was sucked back into the wall; at that moment, a larger square pattern appeared. It was a door that allowed him to enter the secret room!\n[Releasing door lock.]\nIt was a miracle; he had revived something from several years ago... A part of lost history had been revived due to Lee Shin Woo, and it was at that moment that the mana within his body intensified, surged, and exploded.\nThe countless, dormant knowledge fragments and his talent connected, causing a big bang that he couldn’t contain!\n[You have acquired the passive skill, Magic Tracking Lv1! Magic has increased by 3.]\n[Low Rank Magic Affinity, Low Rank Magic Accumulation, and Low Rank Magic Tracking skills have compounded and evolved.]\nHis ability to sense magic, accept it, and track it were all connected into one. A method of more effectively producing mana, circulating it, and utilizing it instinctually rose up into his head.\nIt was something that he couldn’t have even dreamed of until now, as well as being absurdly complex and headache inducing, but... it was possible for him now. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and accepted the mysterious feeling. He accumulated the knowledge and applied it.\n[You have acquired the special passive skill, Low Rank Mana Bone Lv5! Magic has increased by 30.]\nAt that moment, mana indiscriminately spread through his body, covered his bones, and caused a fundamental change!\n[Low Rank Mana Bone Lv5 (Passive)]\n[Originally, humans were organisms that did not welcome mana, and through their strong tenacity as well as their talent, they realized a method to harmonize with mana. In order to more perfectly handle the mana that spread throughout the body as it pleased, the mana is accepted, created, and circulated by an imaginary organ that covers the heart. They called it the mana heart.]\n[However, you are a skeleton without a heart, so you have done something outrageous and substituted the mana heart with your entire boney body. That scale is truly enormous, and if you did not have a considerable understanding and handling of mana, it would’ve been impossible to even attempt.]\n[By achieving a balance between the vast knowledge, your talent in mana, and the special situation, this astonishing skill was born, and no one besides yourself knows the growth potential of this astonishing skill.]\nIt was truly an odd feeling. It felt as though he had taken off some unnatural clothes and he’d been thrown into a world filled with mana, naked. His body, composed of 206 bones, was integrated with mana and each of those individual bones were now more closely connected.\nOf course, controlling all 206 bones simultaneously while controlling the mana was certainly not easy. Even if he was aided by the skill, there was way too much to focus on at one time, and he was afflicted with pain that felt as though he was being split apart.\nIt wasn’t a joke; if he were to lose control and was flooded by the mana, it wouldn’t be strange for his bones to shatter. He would have to constantly exert himself to adapt to this skill from now on.\n[The invigorated flow of mana increases the body’s reaction speed.]\n[The invigorated flow of mana shortens the activation time of all skills.]\n[You have successfully absorbed some outside mana and stored it. Mana has increased by 1.]\nHowever, enduring the pain was bound to lead to sweet rewards. He’d only tasted a portion of it, yet it wasn’t hard to realize that the effectiveness of his mana increased by more than several times. Even manifesting, collecting, and producing mana had increased!\nFor the first time, Lee Shin Woo felt like he had the right to call himself a hero. And... that qualification wasn’t just this.\n[At only level 3, you have acquired a portion of the qualification necessary to walk the path of an Archmage, one who naturally commands nature and changes the world. Magic has increased by 20. You have acquired the Archmage’s karma token.]\n[Quest complete! You have acquired 1 Lv6 Weapon Trickster’s arm bone.]\n[You have already achieved the Trickster’s karma, but you are merely at the level of a toddler. The more personas you acquire, the more your strength grows. That is the path you have chosen, as well as the karma you have been bestowed.]\n\"Hoo...\"\nHe had just been trying to find the secret room, yet had experienced a sudden change, one that he couldn’t dream of; even after calming down the rushing mana, he momentarily stood still in order to get a hold of himself.\nLee Shin Woo kept control of the mana and circulated it. He felt the mana that his bones harmoniously spewed out as well as the resonating external mana so clearly that he thought that he would feel nauseous with the slightest slip. He likened this feeling to that of riding a roller coaster.\n’I’d rather just vomit, but these damn bones won’t let me.’\nIt wasn’t an issue that could be dealt with in a short amount of time, though thankfully it was a problem that could still be solved. Just like how a human isn’t usually aware of their breathing or the blinking of their eyes, but still does so naturally, he was training the control of his Mana Bone skill in order for it to operate unconsciously.\n’Talk is cheap...’\nLee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and stayed in place for the moment. How much time had passed? At around the time where his head still hurt but he could move it like usual, Lee Shin Woo sighed in relief and checked the bone he had gotten as a reward for the quest.\n[Lv6 Weapon Trickster’s Arm Bone]\n[A Trickster’s arm bone, that was used as a weapon to cajole their enemies. There is enough recorded within to reform one’s existence.]\n\"Huh...\"\nIt was overwhelmingly distinctive compared to the other bones he had absorbed thus far; he couldn’t suppress his admiration of the bone as he inspected it. It had an awfully large amount of mana within, was obviously extremely tough, and the fact that each of its finger bones was a different shape was especially distinctive.\nPerhaps the Trickster was an existence that didn’t need a weapon. He decided that it would be important to figure out how this weapon was connected to the Trickster; for now he’ll reinforce...\n[The activation of the skill has failed. You are not prepared to accept the strength within the bone yet.]\n’...Ah, this pattern finally came up.’\nHe was already a bit prepared for this, but since it actually happened, it tasted bitter. If that was going to happen, he wanted to complain and ask why they gave him such a mouth watering bone at this time, but when he thought about it in another way, he felt like he was that amazing to have cleared a quest that was so far above his level.\n’Well, it should be possible soon.’\nIf Bone Reinforcement couldn’t accept it, then he would have to forget about this bone for now. Lee Shin Woo inspected the bone with a deeply regretful expression, and in the end, put it into his inventory.\nWell, he already had his hands full adapting to, and applying the Mana Bone skill he had just awakened. It might’ve actually turned out well for him. Lee Shin Woo convinced himself of this and raised his head.\nThe secret door that had revealed itself for the first time in dozens of years looked worn out.\n’Alright.’\nLee Shin Woo firmly resolved himself and placed his hand atop the door. The door silently rose up, to the point that it was difficult to believe that it had lain undisturbed for dozens of years.\nThe records of General Seagald, and the records of the research related to Gerrit...! Thinking that the secret was right before his eyes caused him to feel excited once again, but before Lee Shin Woo’s eyes was...\n[Keuhaaaaaaahk!]\nA skeleton without an inch of flesh remaining popping out and attacking him!",

    "content": "<Chapter 9. Anti-Skull - 1>\n[Keuaaaaaaahk!]\n\"Tch!\"\nIt precisely aimed for Lee Shin Woo with its sharp sword strike! It truly was a perfect surprise attack, but Lee Shin Woo was faster, and avoided its attack. He bent his head back and kicked upwards, causing the sword in the skeleton’s grip to go flying!\n[Keuhaaaaaaaahk!]\n\"This is...\"\nThe skeleton’s sword flew directly up and lodged into the ceiling. However, the skeleton seemed unconcerned, fixed its gaze at Lee Shin Woo, and charged. It seemed as though its mana was focused into its palm, and it attacked Lee Shin Woo for a second time with its hands dyed in a dark green!\n’It’s acid, a poison made from mana. It’s at a similar level to the Great Slime’s, and if that’s the case...!’\nIt was at that moment. Through his skill in mana analysis, which had noticeably increased due to his Mana Bone, he was able to grasp the structure of his enemy’s skill, and at that very moment, the bone he had absorbed before... the Acid Ghoul’s Thumbnail awakened its potential!\n[You have learned the active skill, Intermediate Acid Poison Spray Lv1. Strength, and Magic have increased by 15. Low Rank Acid Resistance has become Lv7.]\n[You have achieved the feat of acquiring a intermediate skill. All stats increase by 5.]\n\"Huh!?\"\nLee Shin Woo was so astonished that he almost lost control of his mana for a moment. Intermediate!? Though the Acid Ghoul’s ability was indeed frightening, when he normally learned a skill, he thought that they’d always be at a reduced level, so he couldn’t help but be astonished.\nCould this also be due to Mana Bone? He was able to completely reproduce the special properties of the mana within the memories and experiences now, so if all the skills that he was going to learn in the future started at a high level... then him learning the Mana Bone skill would have been the best thing that happened to him ever since he was dropped into the Empire!\n\"Heut.\"\n[Ggeuaaaaahk!]\nThe deep green mist that rose from his fingertips softly wrapped around the skeleton’s palm. At that moment, it yelled in fright and retreated back, colliding with a desk. Lee Shin Woo saw a portion of the documents atop the desk melt away from the poison and freakily yelled out.\n\"Hey, hey. Calm down!\"\n[Acid Poison!? Who... are you...!]\nFortunately, the skeleton stopped when Lee Shin Woo spoke. No, perhaps it regained feeling after seeing him use Acid Poison. Honestly, it was good regardless. His top priority was to calm it down if he wanted to preserve these precious documents and prevent further damage.\n\"I’m one of Gerrit’s people.\"\nLee Shin Woo slowly stepped back and lead him away from the materials, so that they wouldn’t be damaged, and answered him calmly.\nHe had already begun acting by the time he realized that he needed to proceed delicately. And he was able to say the lines most suitable for the situation!\n[Gerrit...?]\nHis hand paused its strike midair. He had hit the mark! Thɪs chapter is updatᴇd by novel•fire.net\n[You’re... a subordinate of Doctor Gerrit Aterran? I... don’t recall seeing you before. Are you part of the guard...?]\n\"No, I’m not a guard. If I was, I would’ve died with you. I came by his request.\"\n[Did Doctor Aterran die... T-That’s natural I suppose...]\nThe skeleton despaired, and dropped its head. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo was actually surprised. He had thought he needed to calm it down no matter what, but he didn’t think that one line would calm it down.\nThe moment the skeleton got a hold of itself, a message appeared in front of Lee Shin Woo.\n[The Acting skill has become Lv5. Those who listen to your words will instinctually have a good impression of you.]\n[Your body is black, huh...]\n\"It’s because of the poison.\"\n[Your poison’s really strong. ...Yeah, our tests were like that. Now I remember a little bit.]\nAt around that time, the skeleton had completely lost its fighting spirit. It inspected Lee Shin Woo and when it subsequently turned to look at its own body, which was likewise composed of only bones, it muttered miserably.\n[Our test ultimately failed. We couldn’t stop ourselves from turning into undead... In the end, that foolish Emperor tried to prevent disaster by calling an even greater disaster!]\nThose words felt as though Lee Shin Woo had just been hit by a straight punch. It had clearly recognized that it was an undead, and was also aware of the passage of time!\nWas this perhaps an effect caused by them performing tests within the sewers? If that’s true, then in the Empire...!? Lee Shin Woo did his best to conceal his astonishment no matter what, and replied to the skeleton.\n\"However, you’re better off than the guys outside. Since the guys outside have lost their reason and are going wild.\"\n[Is it a half success...? Come in, comrade. If I think about it, you, who knows the code for the Anti-Skull, can’t be my enemy. It seems as though I had also lost my reason until just a little while ago. Since all I did was despair alone from within here...]\n\"Thanks.\"\nAnti-Skull, huh. It definitely had a connection with the skull pattern drawn on the door lock. There was a small chance that it was just a code name, but there was a high chance that it stood for the organization of their group as well. Lee Shin Woo decided to remember that word.\n[Did you move around by yourself? If not, are you acting based on General Seagald’s orders?]\n\"No, I’m acting based on Gerrit’s request. I need to collect all the research materials so that it can’t be misused.\"\n[Ah... I see. Those precious materials are spread about in this kind of place. That’s certainly an important task.]\nIt was really easy to handle the skeleton. Was it because it had just regained its reasoning, or was it due to its memories not being completely intact? If it’s not that either, then was it due to his Acting skill? If he could handle him as he pleases, then it didn’t matter.\nLee Shin Woo collected all the materials that remained intact despite the passage of dozens of years. The skeleton even helped him with his task. In the end, he made this request.\n[There may be some of our comrades still out there. Could you help search for them?]\n\"Alright. Since I need to collect all the materials anyway.\"\nHe was patiently sitting in his seat, and though he really wanted to inspect the materials, the current situation wouldn’t allow him to. However, the moment Lee Shin Woo nodded at the skeleton’s words, the mana in front of him slightly shook.\n[A quest has occurred!]\n[Those who uphold the spirit of a ruined nation.]\n[You have found traces of those who still resist in the Empire, and came in contact with them. No one knows how this attempt will turn out in the future. But what’s certain is that it will be an extremely difficult challenge.]\n[Quest goal: Find and aid the Poison Skeleton’s comrades.]\n[Quest reward: 1 permit for God’s secret shop, and 1 Lv3 medicine.]\n’This... does this mean that God is interested in this place too?’\nIt would be really unconventional as a hero to listen to their circumstances and act without killing them. However, on the contrary, God wouldn’t punish him for it and instead encouraged him do so, which was really interesting.\nOf course, regardless of whether God liked it or not, Lee Shin Woo would act as he pleased!\n[How are you going to deal with all of those?]\n\"I probably have to store them. There’s something that Gerrit prepared before he died.\"\n[As expected of Doctor Aterran.]\nLee Shin Woo and the Poison Skeleton confirmed that there weren’t any more materials inside the room and left the passageway. As he saw the Poison Skeleton, which had withdrawn its sword, crawl out of the door, he smacked his lips.\n\"Shouldn’t you move a bit quieter?\"\n[You don’t need to be that careful. The only things in this sewer are just research material slimes.]\n\"Yeah, they are just slimes, but... Well, whatever.\"\nLee Shin Woo gave up on trying to convince it. When he thought about it, since he had invested so much time into familiarizing himself with Mana Bone, the Great Slime should’ve been far away from him by now. It was probably hectically eating up all the other slimes in the dungeon about now.\n[Now that I think about it, I haven’t introduced myself yet. My name is... Ugh, I don’t remember my name. It isn’t just my name. I don’t even remember who I was... I wonder why? I remember the tests and the curse, but there’s nothing I remember about myself! It’s as though the inside of my head is completely empty...!]\nIf he was a human instead of a skeleton, he would’ve seemed like a main character, but the world wouldn’t remember a mere extra’s amnesia! Surprisingly, Lee Shin Woo replied uninterestedly.\n\"The fact that your head’s empty just means that there’s a lot you can fill it with from now on.\"\n[That’s...!]\nHe’d only said a suitable line he’d seen from somewhere before, yet it seemed like the skeleton was deeply moved. While he was at it, Lee Shin Woo decided to give him some more service.\n\"First, let’s give you a name. Now your name’s Paul.\"\n[Paul... It’s an alright name! What’s your name?]\n\"I’m... Paul Zero.\"\nIt was a name he’d thought up himself, but it was really an alias without a speck of creativity.\n[Then... Paul Zero, this way. I don’t remember anything regarding myself, but I definitely remember the way.]\n\"Great. Let’s go, Paul!\"\nLee Shin Woo and Paul moved quickly. He definitely moved a lot more efficiently because he had a guide. No matter how excellent his mana senses had gotten from learning Mana Bone, it took a certain amount of manual labor to find the secret passageways...!\nHe was suddenly in awe of his foresight, as he hadn’t killed the skeleton and dealt with the issue by just talking. Lee Shin Woo honestly hadn’t thought that this was how it would turn out.\n[We’ve arrived. You see it too, right?]\n\"Yeah, I’m opening it right away.\"\nLee Shin Woo released the lock more skillfully than before and opened the door. There were three skeletons within, but they were just like Paul had been, and had lost their reason.\n[Kyaaaaaahk!]\n[Kiaaaaaaah!]\n\"Yeah, yeah. I thought you’d be this way.\"\nLee Shin Woo sighed and softly spewed his Acid Poison at them. It wasn’t acid magic, nor was it a curse, and the skeletons that basked in the poison went ’hmm’ in surprise, and stopped moving. It was honestly really funny.\n[The taste of this poison is... It’s the taste of an ally...!]\n[Y-You’re... Are you a soldier from another test by any chance?]\n[To think that I’m a skeleton... A skeleton!]\n\"Now, I understand your complicated feelings, but I received Gerrit Aterran’s request and you guys are undead that have their reason. We’re all friends here, so just calm down for now.\"\nLee Shin Woo perfectly utilized his Acting skill and calmed them down. Paul, who saw Lee Shin Woo instantly clean up inside, just carelessly clapped with his bare bone hands.\n[The power in your voice is unusual. As expected, it seems you weren’t a normal person after all. What do you think our relationship was in the past? Ugh, I don’t remember!]\n\"You already said that before, so be quiet and stand over here in order. You’re Paul 2, you’re Paul 3, and you’re Paul 4...\"\nThe four Pauls had a touching reunion, even though five minutes hadn’t even passed yet. Since they were all composed of bones now, it was difficult to recover their previous form, but they definitely remembered that they followed and trusted the same general, and cooperated with the tests.\nMoreover, since they were all level 3, they were highly likely to all have had the same post in their past life.\n[To think that you’re carrying out Doctor Aterran’s will even after becoming an undead... You’re amazing.]\n[Won’t you come with us to meet General Seagald? General Seagald definitely wouldn’t have given up on the magic research.]\n\"I’ll probably go and see you guys someday. I’ll remember you guys.\"\nLee Shin Woo instantly refused the offer of the Pauls who had reached a mutual understanding, and quickly collected the materials.\nAnd in the process, he took a sideways glance at the characters that they used, and the materials definitely weren’t written in Korean, but he could naturally read them. It was probably the same reason he could communicate with others, despite never learning the Empire’s language.\n\"Now, shall we go and check the remaining materials?\"\n[Hey, but wait... don’t you hear something strange from somewhere?]\n[Now that you mention it, yeah.]\nPaul affirmed Paul 3’s statement. Then, Paul 4, who had gone out of the door before the rest of them, spoke with a slightly stiff voice.\n[I hear the crawling sound of... something huge.]\n- Kwang!\nImmediately after, a portion of the passageway burst. Beyond it, a huge slime dyed in a dark green revealed itself and faced them. Its truly dreary aura was so heavy that its body sagged, and that heavy acid mist spread through its surroundings.\n[Lv4 King Slime]\n[You have found the target of your revenge. When you fight it, all stats increase by 30%. Flames of Revenge receive a 30% additional bonus.]\n[Geureureureuoooooooooooooooh!]\nThe King Slime, which discovered Lee Shin Woo, forcefully howled and the tough passageway walls began to quickly crack. However, the Poison Skeletons were terrified and instinctually stepped back; on the contrary, Lee Shin Woo looked pleased and stepped forward. He was slightly disappointed that it wasn’t an Emperor Slime, but still, this was great!\n\"Let’s play, Pudding!\"\n[Gureureureureureureu!]\nThe King Slime responded vigorously to Lee Shin Woo’s offer. It seemed like it really missed Lee Shin Woo too.\nThe Pauls looked like they were going to cry when they saw the walls quickly crack as a result of the King Slime’s full speed charge, but unfortunately for them, there was no place to run.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 9 part2",
    "content": "<Chapter 9. Anti-Skull - 2>\nTo cut to the point, the environment they were in wasn’t great for running around and playing hide-and-seek. It was because whenever the King Slime moved, the drain pipes would split, crumble, and spill dirt, causing chaos. The Pauls, who hadn’t yet gotten used to their skeleton bodies, flinched whenever that happened.\n[Gureureureuaaaaaaaaaaah!]\n\"If I can properly see it, then there’s nothing to worry about!\"\nLee Shin Woo moved his body, avoiding the King Slime’s charge, and comforted the Pauls. However, the King Slime collided with the sewer drain pipes, causing the whole area to crumble, and by seeing this, the Pauls yelled out.\n[If this goes on, the secret facilities will collapse too!]\n\"What?\"\nCertainly, the whole sewer could collapse at this rate. Honestly, it didn’t really matter if a worthless sewer collapsed, but he couldn’t allow all the facilities to collapse before he got a chance to look over the materials.\n\"I have no choice since it’s come to this.\"\nLee Shin Woo stiffly nodded his head and retreated. The Pauls’ attention remained completely fixed on him and followed him.\n\"I’ll bring more reinforcements, so keep it busy!\"\n[We can’t. That’s impossible!]\n\"No, you guys can do it. I’ll make it so you can.\"\nPudding had pierced through the sewer pipes, became covered in dirt, and spread poison while in the process. Lee Shin Woo took a short deep breath, and towards the Pauls, who sported expressions akin to young birds gazing at the mother bird (of course, skeletons are expressionless so one wouldn’t be able to tell, but that’s roughly the feeling), as well as Pudding... screamed with all his might.\n\"I’m really sorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry!\"\n[By using Low Rank Shriek of the Dead, you have caused your enemies to fall into a frenzied and fearful state.]\n[You have succeeded in using a skill against an enemy a higher level than you! The Low Rank Shriek of the Dead skill has become Lv2.]\n[Kurureureureureureureureu!]\n[Ugh... Keuaaaaaaaaaahk!]\n[Kihik...! I-It’s an enemy!]\nThe four Poison Skeletons, that had for a time regained their reason, had once again completely lost their reasoning due to Lee Shin Woo’s shriek. It was such a heinous act that it wouldn’t be strange if the Devil came and asked if he could take him as his older brother.\nOf course, he had expected that it would work on the skeletons, but he hadn’t expected that the skill would work on the level 4 King Slime! It might be because it hadn’t been very long since it had evolved.\n\"Good. You’re going to die anyway, so if you’re going to die, you might as well shave off some of the slime’s health!\"\nLee Shin Woo left a rotten farewell to the Pauls, and rather than say a farewell to the King Slime, which began to struggle in what seemed to be an overlapping frenzied and fearful state, he shot a Fire Bullet at it (catapulting his index finger + Flames of Revenge).\nHe wanted to see if it would self-destruct like a Great Slime, or if it would have a different response to the fire, but... was it because of the frenzied state? It didn’t show any signs of self-destructing despite the fire spreading. Lee Shin Woo was satisfied by that fact and retreated completely.\n[You have run away from the target of your revenge twice. An Avenger can gladly bear the shame of running away twice. When you encounter your enemy again, all stats increase by an additional 15%. However, running away a third time is forbidden.]\n[Quest failed.]\n’I ran away from the target of the quest, so it’s natural that I failed the quest, but... I didn’t know the Avenger skill had this kind of option.’\nThe fact that running away a third time was forbidden meant that he couldn’t just blindly run away from his enemy just because it was scary or else he may be penalized by the skill.\nWell, he had thought that the performance of the skill greatly outweighed the risks, but he hadn’t expected this kind of surprise hidden within the skill. He thought that there wouldn’t be a case where he’d run away from the same enemy three times in a row, but there also wasn’t a guarantee that it wouldn’t happen, so it was truly a difficult situation.\n’However, should I just meekly run away now?’\nIf he fought it right now, he was confident that he could win. However, he really wanted to collect all of the hidden materials in the sewers. Especially because he realized now that his Avenger skill overlapped and would increase his abilities even more, so it wouldn’t be a loss if he just looked at the result.\n’At best, I’m throwing away the navigator I’d gained into the jaws of death, and it’s become a situation where I have to explore the sewers when I don’t know when it’ll collapse...’\nHowever, since he’d gone through the hidden facilities’ pattern twice already, he was just as confident in exploring the sewers. The sole problem right now was that he needed to find the hidden facilities before the sewers completely gave way...\n’It was a good thing I chose to use Shriek of the Dead. It’s become considerably quieter.’\nOf course, the duration of his skill wasn’t very long, so it should start going wild again soon, so... it was key that he found the facilities before then.\nLee Shin Woo used his Combat Sprint to its utmost and started to dash. The Great Slime had cleaned the sewers of monsters, so it was completely barren, and if he excluded the dirt that occasionally dropped onto his head, there wasn’t anything that got in his way.\n\"Found it.\"\nWithin only 2 minutes, he found the third hidden facility, and thoughtlessly opened the door. Surprisingly, there were five skeletons waiting with bated breath!\n[H-He opened the door.]\n[You idiot...!]\n[Who are you? Are you a member of the project? No, it doesn’t matter who you are. There’s a fearsome monster roaming around outside!]\nThis was unexpected. It seems like the catastrophe that befell the sewers after dozens of years of silence, the birth of the Great Slime, had caused them to independently regain their reason.\n\"So, you’re planning on waiting until it collapses the entire sewer and then dying together? If you plan on burying the efforts of the General who struggled to stop the curse as well, then stay crouched there.\"\n[Ugh...!?]\n[Who do you think you are, to say the General’s name here!?]\n\"Does it matter who I am right now?\"\nHe collected all the materials. Lee Shin Woo gazed at them icily (that kind of feeling), and the skeletons glared sharply at him; and he exited the facility, as if there were no value in saying anything more.\n\"After I collect all the traces of our resistance, I’m going to fight that monster in order to open up our future. You guys can stay here, cuddle with your curse bound bones and disappear.\"\n[...]\n[W-Wait a sec.]\nOne of the skeletons grabbed onto Lee Shin Woo’s arm bone. Lee Shin Woo, who had felt a bit anxious that he hadn’t been harsh enough, secretly felt relieved.\n[I-If the facility is going to crumble and everyone’s going to die, then... I’ll fight with you. Damn it, I can’t go to hell without achieving anything.]\n[It’s the same for me too. In the end, I may have been too depressed that we hadn’t been able to prevent the curse. If you’re a knight of the Empire, you have to be able to fight your enemy without fear...!]\n\"...Talk is cheap. Prove it to me with your actions starting now.\"\nLee Shin Woo thought it was time to reproach them more... and as soon as he replied frigidly, the skeletons actually seemed to show some pride, and walked ahead of him with heavy footsteps.\nHe thought when he saw them. ’Hoo, it may be because skeletons don’t have brains, but I’m telling you, it’s really easy to trick them!’\n\"We have to check the remaining hidden facilities first and then act. Before that... Do you each remember your names?\"\n[That’s... I don’t remember anything about myself...]\n\"Alright then, from this side in order, you’re Paul, Paul 2, Paul 3...\"\nLee Shin Woo treated the skeletons that he had left behind to fight the King Slime as already dead, so he forcibly took their names and passed them on!\nIt was an extremely wicked and careless naming ceremony, but the Pauls didn’t realize it, and were touched as they thought that he ’accepted them as comrades’. They accepted Lee Shin Woo as their temporary leader, so he didn’t really need to make up an alias!\n’If I came out strong from the start, I could’ve finished it without lying unnecessarily.’\nLee Shin Woo learned a new way to conduct himself based on the situation. If he used the difference of strength between him and his target, and said something suitable, they wouldn’t probe him, and at the same time, he could set up their relationship such that he was superior!\n’...Though even I think it’s really not something a hero should do.’\nAround the time that Lee Shin Woo pondered whether he was going in the right direction or not, he finally arrived at the last area. There were seven Poison Skeletons within, and they also obediently joined up with him. With this, he had gathered 12 level 3 Skeletons, excluding himself.\n\"I’ve collected all of the materials. Now let’s go and take care of the monster!\"\n[Let’s go!]\nAs they had increased in numbers, it seemed the skeletons inevitably swelled with confidence. Even though they had regained their reason, they were still fundamentally idiots.\n’Anyway...’\nWhile Lee Shin Woo was encouraging the skeletons and advancing forward, he caught a glimpse of the end of the dungeon. The final secret facility, as well as the adjoining passageway; on the side of the wall, there was a trace that it’d been completely torn out. It looked like that was the boss room... it was obvious, but he didn’t feel anything in there.\n’What happens in this case? Does it recognize killing the King Slime as killing the boss...?’\nHe had undergone various strange experiences in this dungeon, which was truly odd. The experience he acquired here should be helpful later. He ran while thinking such miscellaneous thoughts, and in no time reached the area where he had first encountered the King Slime.\n[You have found the target of your revenge. When you fight it, all abilities increase by 45%. Flames of Revenge receive an additional bonus of 45%. It is your opponent’s last chance, as well as yours.]\n[Kureureureuaaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\nThe King Slime, which had discovered Lee Shin Woo, howled forcefully. It didn’t have any traces of the Flames of Revenge on its body anymore. He had felt the connection of mana terminate in the middle and had roughly assumed as much.\n\"You weren’t able to shake it off at the right time, so your body has gotten a lot smaller, huh?\"\n[Kuaaaaaah!]\nIt acted as though it could understand what Lee Shin Woo was saying and the King Slime’s temper flared, though its body had considerably lessened compared to when he had first saw it. It was to the point that he would believe it if someone said it was a slightly big Great Slime.\nHowever, the smaller it got, the more its strength was concentrated in its body; its strength alone wouldn’t lose out to the Acid Ghoul’s.\n[Kuaaaaaaaah...!]\n[I-I can’t believe it.]\n[My bones...]\nWhereas the 12 Pauls murmured to themselves when they saw the four big and small bones scattered around the battlefield. Of course, the owner of those bones were all dead... No, actually, they were the skeletons of the original Pauls 1 through 4.\nThey had fought so desperately, so there was no way they’d come out alive from fighting the King Slime.\n\"Those guys chose to sacrifice themselves in order to keep the results of our tests safe, as well as hide us from the enemy, which allowed me to rescue you guys.\"\nLee Shin Woo chattered away so calmly about them, even though they had died so unfairly; if the original Pauls, who had become bones, had heard him, they would’ve returned as evil spirits to haunt him. It would be really fun if they came back as evil spirits.\n\"You’re not going to let their sacrifice go to waste, are you? For the Empire, and for yourselves... We’re stepping over their corpses!\"\n[Ouooooooooh!]\n[I’ll survive no matter what! Even though I’m a skeleton, there’s hope if I survive!]\n[I’ll crush that mushy monster!]\nThe effect was amazing! The morale of the 12 Pauls soared and they each raised their weapons, and charged at the King Slime! The King Slime seemed to find it laughable and spewed its Acid Poison, though because they were Poison Skeletons, they weren’t harmed very much.\n\"Think back to when you were warriors! Dying to a mere slime like that is disgraceful!\"\nLee Shin Woo encouraged the skeletons and comfortably took a pose from the rear. The flames would just cause it to self-destruct, so for now, he planned to fire his Grenade (Catapult + Self-Destruct) to weaken the slime.\n\"Then... fire!\"\n[Gguaaaaaaang!]\nThe resulting explosion from the index finger shot inflicted tremendous damage to the King Slime, causing it to rampage about; unfortunately, the 12 Poison Skeletons fought desperately without reservation, so Lee Shin Woo couldn’t attack without them making way.\nAs it had done before, the Great Slime bounced its body, but even if it tried to crush the skeletons, there were heaps of earth everywhere and its huge body didn’t allow it to move very easily!\n\"Hmph, it’s all going according to plan...!\"\nLee Shin Woo confirmed that the situation was going his way, going exactly as planned, though he hadn’t actually set up any such plan; he regenerated his index finger and prepared his second Catapult. There weren’t any skeletons that had died yet.\n’I hope you guys last until the King Slime dies.’\nLee Shin Woo stood behind his humans shields... no, his skeleton shields and leisurely fired his Fire Bullet while grinning. That’s how he raised the curtains to an extremely one-sided and cowardly battle. Google seaʀᴄh novel⟡fire.net",

I’m shooting one more time!\"\n[The Low Rank Catapult skill has become Lv2. The launching speed increases. Agility has increased by 1.]\nWhile the 12 Pauls were busy holding off the King Slime’s offensive, Lee Shin Woo used the Pauls as a moving trench to protect himself; so long as his mana would allow it, he would continuously shoot his Grenade. He had thought this before, but there was nothing more reassuring than having reinforcements blocking off the enemy!\n[Gureureuoooooh!]\nWhenever a portion of the King Slime’s body burst, it would desperately collect the mana from those pieces, and though it would’ve been better if the flames had stuck, they at least forced a significant amount of mana to be condensed into its main body.\nRather than cleaving its core and killing it, he needed to slowly condense its mana, whether it be by fire, or explosions, as that would help him get the core!\nIf it didn’t look like a core would come out, then he would use his Flames of Revenge, even if it meant sacrificing the Pauls. Thankfully he was really lucky.\n[Ugh, it’s too strong...!]\n[Hold it back, comrades! Our pain will be the foundation that unlocks our future!]\n[Paul Twelve...!]\nIn the midst of the intense battle, it seemed as though the Pauls had formed a deep sense of camaraderie. Lee Shin Woo hated his body, which couldn’t eat popcorn, and shot a Grenade at the King Slime.\nLee Shin Woo was excited about how many stats its core would give him, and was counting his chickens before they hatched. But at that moment, the King Slime quickly rolled its body and dodged the launched finger!\n\"What!?\"\n[Gureureuk...!]\nLee Shin Woo momentarily did a double take. He then saw that it’s flesh had been torn off from the constant Grenades in the past 20 minutes, and the size of its body had lessened to an extent that it could move now, even in this narrow space.\nFurthermore, during the battle, a few of the Pauls had died, so there was a gap in their encirclement; at that moment, the King Slime didn’t lose the opportunity and had begun its counteroffensive!\n[Ggureuk!]\n[Keuaaaaahk!]\n[P-Paul Three!]\nThey couldn’t cope with its swift movements and Paul 3 was struck by its charge. At that moment, it focused its Acid Poison at one point and spewed it! Paul 3 melted instantaneously and in its place, only a single shabby bone remained.\n[Paul Threeeeeeeeeeeeee!]\n\"Get a hold of yourselves you guys. Don’t lose track of its movements!\"\nLee Shin Woo gritted his teeth and shot a Grenade. Immediately after his attack, he would’ve taken advantage of the explosion’s opening and hit it again, but something truly astounding occurred. Before the Grenade burrowed into its body and exploded, the shot melted away without a trace.\nHe didn’t know what kind of conditions it satisfied to become like this, but he was sure that the King Slime’s poison had been instantaneously strengthened! It might’ve even been comparable to the Acid Ghoul’s!\n\"That bastard...\"\n[Gureureureuk!]\nThen, the King Slime emitted a peculiar sound, as if it were mocking them, and vibrated its body. Compared to before, its body was definitely dyed in a deep green.\n[Its poison has gotten stronger.]\n[Ours bodies melt away just by getting close.]\nThe sickening deadly poison mist filled the narrow space. At that moment, the Poison Skeletons trembled as they were completely stuck within the poison mist. They had briefly forgotten how terrifying acid poison was after being reborn as Poison Skeletons!\n[Gureureureuk!]\n\"Tch, it’s troublesome if you all die already!\"\nThe King Slime thought it had an opportunity, and attempted to sweep away all of the Poison Skeletons at once by spreading its deadly poison, but before it could do so, Lee Shin Woo charged and rammed into its body.\nIn the process of hunting it down, he could sacrifice the Poison Skeletons one by one, but he couldn’t helplessly lose all of his shields all at once!\n[Gureuk!?]\nBecause its body had shrunk, its weight had also lessened; the King Slime couldn’t endure Lee Shin Woo’s charge and powerlessly bounced while being blown away.\nHowever, there was something more important than that. Despite being in contact with the strong Acid Poison, the poison which melted rocks in one fell swoop, he flawlessly endured and was still standing.\n[You have been affected by the King Slime’s strengthened Acid Poison. Low Rank Acid Resistance has successfully resisted 90% of the damage.]\n[The Low Rank Acid Resistance skill has become Lv8.]\n\"Good...As long as I don’t get stuck inside its body, I can endure it.\"\nSince the index finger bone lodged into its body instantly melted away, he was secretly quite worried, but it seems as though his main body was able to endure its Acid Poison through a combination of his Harden and Acid Resistance skills. Though he did receive some injuries, he could heal this much damage with Regeneration instantly.\n[Gureureureureuk!]\nIt seemed like the King Slime realized that Lee Shin Woo wasn’t an opponent it could overcome by just thoughtlessly spewing its poison around as it gradually began to retreat.\nLee Shin Woo hadn’t come at it from the front and just trivially attacked it from the rear with flames or bullets, yet the fact that he actually possessed the toughest body here slightly shocked the King Slime. ...And honestly, the King Slime wasn’t the only one shocked.\n[H-How is he still alive even after taking that poison...!]\n[W-We can’t win. The test was a failure. In the end, we were cursed; by melting us all, that slime will completely bury us in darkness...!]\n\"You guys just sit in the back and watch.\"\nThe Pauls’ bones shook, like leaves in the wind, and Lee Shin Woo saw them retreat; therefore, he decided to completely forgo using them as shields any longer.\nTheir willpower was already down in the dumps and even if they were to step forward once more, he didn’t know how much longer they’d last against the King Slime. And...\n’The fact that the second phase has begun means that the King Slime’s health and magic are slowly reaching their limit. It’s definitely worth a try, as long as I can block its poison.’\nOf course, it still possessed a combination of strength and speed befitting a level 4 elite monster, but Lee Shin Woo was also receiving the Avenger skill effect. He decided that he could definitely win.\nHe forcefully gripped Bone of Thunder Lasting with both hands and activated Combat Sprint, taking the initiative by charging at it first. The King Slime noticed and quickly bounced its body.\n[Gureureuk!]\n\"Heup...!\"\nIt was an absurdly fast reaction speed. If he didn’t make full use of his temporarily heightened visual acuity, he would lose track of it. The instant Lee Shin Woo read its trajectory, he vertically cleaved downwards!\n\"Ha!\"\nHe firmly stiffened his body with magic, and his sword fell with a force that could cleave the earth, clashing with the King Slime flying in from the front. However, rather than being pushed back, he exerted his strength and pushed downwards with his sword!\n[Gooooooooooooh!]\nThe King Slime couldn’t contest with his strength and bounced away, colliding with the opposite wall.\nThe instant it impacted the extremely precarious wall, the drain pipes completely crumbled and the foundation became unstable. Dirt spewed everywhere, but even within that messy situation, Lee Shin Woo’s eyes didn’t leave the King Slime.\n’Does it also have a Harden ability? There aren’t any scratches on its body...’\nHis sword was plenty sharp. The bastard was just excessively tough! Since it’s body had lessened in size, its physical strength had atrophied to the point that Lee Shin Woo could push it back, but conversely, its magic had been frightfully condensed; it had gotten that much tougher as a result.\n[Gooooooooooh!]\n\"Heup!\"\nThe slime must’ve been uplifted after being unharmed by Lee Shin Woo’s strike, as it bounced from its position and flew towards him again.\nIf he got pushed back here, it’ll be the end! Lee Shin Woo gritted his teeth and clashed with the King Slime. With the resolve to take it down, he infused Power Slash in every strike!\n[A-As I thought, we can’t win.]\n[If he can’t kill it with that tremendous power, then... Ah, ahhhh. The poison, the poison mist is rising!]\nSince he was fighting while listening to the Paul’s draining ’BGM’, it didn’t work. No, it was honestly just that his current strength couldn’t overcome the King Slime. Looking at the situation of the battle, he figured that if he could buy more time, he would be able to get a decisive strike in, but the problem was...\n’...I can’t just keep repeatedly attacking and defending until its mana runs out.’\nThis sewer facility was counting down to its destruction. The pouring dirt would make it difficult to even move soon. It would become the worst environment to fight in.\nIn order to finish it before then... it would be a bit difficult, but this was the only choice. He resolved himself and activated his skill.\n’Flames of Revenge.’\nThe black flames softly blazed atop his index finger bone. Seeing that hateful fire, the King Slime spewed the deadly poison that had been condensed in its body all at once in all directions, and filled the space with poison.\n\"Good, you’re definitely responding to it.\"\n[Gureuk...!]\nThe deadly poison mist and his black flames met, emitting a crackling sound; the flames burned the poison and the smoky heat surged. If he just remained like this, both sides would just run out of magic, so Lee Shin Woo raised his index finger about shoulder height, aimed, and postured to shoot.\n’I don’t know how many times it’ll self-destruct from the flames until it leaves behind its core, but... I have no choice.’\nHowever, before he shot, one of the vacantly watching Pauls suddenly muttered.\n[...I remember.]\n\"Hmm?\"\nHe spoke at such great timing that Lee Shin Woo stopped his Catapult. It was truly a relief that the King Slime saw the unwaning flames and felt extremely anxious, making it unable to move its body.\nHe didn’t know whether they knew about the situation or not, but Paul kept muttering.\n[I... Before I was appointed as a knight, I applied for this test.]\nHearing that, Lee Shin Woo furrowed his brows. Did they seriously remember their past at this timing? How? However, it wasn’t just him. The other Pauls muttered as well, as if they had promised to do so.\n[I was just a soldier, but due to my performance, I became a Centurion. The one who brought me there was none other than General Seagald...]\n[I... I respected the Emperor. Because of that, I couldn’t pardon his mistake, even more than the others.]\n[How could I forget? The way I had lived, the way I must live from now on... All of it was within me all along.]\nIn no time, this space, which had been filled with the thickening, deadly poison the King Slime had spewed, became clean. Even now, the King Slime was responding to the Flames of Revenge and was creating Acid Poison, but the Poison Skeletons were absorbing it all.\n[The test... Was it not a failure?]\n[It failed. It was truly a horrific failure. However, because it was a failure, there was something we could gain from it.]\n[How miserable. However, we need this strength right now.]\nThere was nowhere to run; they couldn’t escape from the Acid Poison, and the skeletons had no other choice but to accept it. And the moment they gave up on everything, they naturally absorbed the Acid Poison as if it were theirs from the beginning... The skeletons were starting to become stronger.\nThe vestige of their past test’s failure had made it possible; it was at this moment that their past karma was connected to the present.\n[Why did I forgot how to use mana?]\n[It feels like someone had locked me in the darkness and stripped away my reason.]\n[I can’t remember my past name at all, but... it’s fine now. We’ve become able to accept both our past and present!]\n[We don’t need to think deeply about what’s within anymore. We just need to walk the path we’ve been taught now!]\nTheir voices sounded much more sure of themselves now, and for some reason, they felt even stronger... The moment he thought that it seemed as though they had leveled up, a deep mana glaringly surged.\nHowever, because Lee Shin Woo didn’t have any eyes, he was able to properly behold the Poison Skeletons’ change.\n[Lv3 Acid Skeleton - Paul]\n[Lv3 Acid Skeleton - Paul Two]\n[Lv3 Acid Skeleton - Paul Four]\n[Lv3 Acid Skeleton - Paul Seven]\n[Lv3 Acid Skeleton - Paul Nine]\n[Lv3 Acid Skeleton - Paul Ten]\n[Lv3 Acid Skeleton - Paul Twelve]\n\"...\"\nTo think he’d see the moment that the undead were reborn as named monsters. They became named monsters with the names he’d given them at that!\nLee Shin Woo was stunned and looked at them with his mouth wide open as the Pauls walked with heavy footsteps more vigorously than before and joined up with him by his side.\n[Sorry we showed you something so unsightly, Captain.] Dıscover more novels at N0veI.Fiɾe.net\n[We’ll fight with you now, too.]\n[Give us the command. I want to respond to the chivalry you showed, Captain.]\n’When the hell did I become your captain, and what the hell do you mean by chivalry?’ is how he eagerly wanted to reply, but... Lee Shin Woo discarded all those thoughts. Though the Empire was incorrigibly cold and arrogant, he acted as though ’their’ Empire was the only warm place in this world.\n\"You’ve finally gotten a hold of yourselves. Hold it back for a bit. You can do that much, can’t you?\"\n[Yes, sir!]\n[Of course!]\nThe seven level 3 elites attacked the King Slime simultaneously. The King Slime attempted to kill them with its poison and charge attacks, but they were no longer the weak skeletons of the past. Ultimately, while it was restrained by the skeletons, Lee Shin Woo took the opportunity to shoot his Fire Bullets in a volley. As it was being barraged with the Fire Bullets, it didn’t even have an opportunity to self-destruct, and died from the flames.\nIt was truly a brutal victory.",

    "content": "<Chapter 9. Anti-Skull - 4>\n[You have hunted the Lv4 King Slime. You have acquired the title ’Slime Hunter’! All of your abilities increase by 20% against slime related monsters, and you have a higher chance of acquiring better loot from them.]\n[You have perfectly cleared the mutated dungeon, the Lv2 ’Secret Sewer’. You have found all the secrets that lay in the dungeon, as well as slaying an elite monster that ate the boss and became stronger. You have acquired the dungeon clear reward. Health and magic has increased by 2.]\n[You have led several subordinates into battle and defeated an enemy a higher level than you. All stats have increased by 1. The Beginner Command skill has evolved into the Low Rank level. When you make a command that fits the situation, the morale of your men increases.]\n[You have succeeded in your revenge. The Beginner Avenger skill has become Lv7. When you meet the target of your revenge again, all abilities increase by 34%.]\nThey were all messages that appeared from him killing the King Slime. However, Lee Shin Woo felt slightly disappointed that he hadn’t received another karma token, but right then, a message appeared that went beyond his expectations.\n[You have achieved the karma of giving the undead who had lost everything a name, and awakening their rebirth. This is a karma that has long since been forgotten, and is a karma that no one can remember. You, who endowed these cursed and rotten individuals with unknown potential, will be called this by the world. The ’Joker’.]\n[The Trickster karma has been absorbed by the Joker karma and has been strengthened. Your future is unknown, such that no one can predict it, and is filled with countless changes. No one can tell you what to do, and no one can dare block your path. Through a dramatic event, your karma has strengthened.]\n[All stats have increased by 10. The Acting skill has become Lv6. The Low Rank Mana Bone skill has become Lv6.]\n\"This is...\"\nLee Shin Woo felt a strength that was greater than any other before permeate his body. Although it might be similar to the Trickster karma, the ’Joker ’ karma was a more powerful karma, so perhaps that was why.\nAs proof, all of his stats increased by 10. Aside from when he leveled up, he had never experienced such a shocking stat increase. Moreover, his skills had grown as well!\n[I feel like Captain’s become even stronger.]\n[He’s someone who could give us names. That’s natural.]\n[Those were truly powerful flames.]\nThe seven surviving Pauls, who had been reborn into elite Acid Skeletons towards the end of the intense battle, saw Lee Shin Woo becoming even stronger following the battle, and said ’as expected’ while nodding their heads.\n\"Ah, you guys...\"\nLee Shin Woo suddenly realized they were there and turned around. When he thought about how they had essentially given him the Joker karma, he had no choice but to change his attitude towards them.\n\"Have you recovered all of your memories?\"\n[Not all of them. However, I realized who I am and what I have to do.]\n[This is all because of you, Captain.]\nAll of them, without exception, were dyed in a deep green, but the fact the weapons they possessed also changed color was truly peculiar. Though their levels didn’t change, their bones were tougher and thicker, and their spirit was no joke.\n[We have to find General Seagald. He definitely hasn’t given up yet. He must be struggling to save this curse ridden Empire.]\n[Like you, Captain. The General will welcome you with open arms.]\n[Let’s go together, Captain.]\nIt was a development that he had roughly expected. Lee Shin Woo picked up the dropped items and acted as if he thought deeply about their request, but truthfully, he already had his answer.\n\"I can’t right now.\"\n[How can that be...]\n\"Since I have something I need to do, too. I’ll go find General Seagald later. It’d be great if I could see you guys then.\"\nGeneral Seagald was someone that was really on his mind too. However, even so, Lee Shin Woo was much too weak to go and find him immediately. His abilities were far too lacking to respond to this situation right now.\nAbove all, he didn’t think that there was any reason to limit his movements this early. Not only did it not fit with his Joker karma, there were plenty of other things on his mind regarding the Empire. Like General Leofield.\n[Is that so... Well, you have your own calling, Captain. We can’t get in the way of that.]\n[We trust that no matter where you are, whatever you’re doing is for the Empire.]\nAll the Pauls agreed and nodded their heads. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly.\n’These guys have already recovered their reason and their memories. It’d be great if I could continue to bring them with me as my subordinates, but there’s a high chance that they’d catch onto the lie in no time.’\nIn the end, his Acting skill was impromptu. At least, for now that is. He would need to hide his human nature and the truth of his identity from them; even then, taking this many of them with him was definitely impossible.\nIf that’s the case, then he could also cleanly take care of them here and take their bones, but...\n’Shall I give it a rest?’\nIt wasn’t a matter of them forming comradeship from fighting together or something like that. He was just purely curious how they, who were created by the ’Joker’ karma, would turn out from now on.\nHe couldn’t relax at all when he thought about how these skeletons, who were endowed with a different destiny because of him, would survive from now on in this Empire.\nAnd honestly speaking... even if it were a sandcastle built on the beach, it would be too much for him to break down himself.\n\"...Wherever you go, don’t go dying quickly. After all, it’ll feel like what I did was meaningless then.\"\n[Of course. We won’t let the names you gave us be in vain.]\n[Paul Zero... I’ll never forget your name.]\n[Let’s meet again for sure.]\nThe skeletons, who realized that they couldn’t convince Lee Shin Woo, each said some parting words to him and turned around.\nThe sewers were already a mess and collapsing, and the space they were currently in wasn’t wide enough to even stretch their legs, but they grouped together and spread their Acid Poison everywhere, allowing them to easily make a path. It was as if they used an eraser to erase the dirt.\n’Now, let’s see.’\nHe drove away the restlessness he felt after the Acid Skeletons—the Pauls, left, and completely raked in the loot buried in dirt and poison. Lee Shin Woo concentrated on that task, and was able to soon forget about those that had left.\n[You have acquired 53,080 Perium.]\n[You have acquired a Lv4 King Slime Bone Core.]\n[You have acquired a Lv3 Poison Skeleton’s rib bone.]\n[Would you like to... with the Lv3 Poison Skeleton’s rib bone...]\nThere was an inherent mana within, so he was able to find them quickly. He naturally received the loot from the King Slime, but he also received the bone from one of the Poison Skeletons that had fought before him!\nHe was naturally pleased when he found a safely remaining bone from their depressing solo act. Lee Shin Woo shoved the acquired Perium into his inventory, then activated Bone Reinforcement, cleanly using up both the bone and the core all at once.\n[Through Bone Reinforcement, Strength has increased by 1, Agility by 1, Health by 6, and Magic by 9. Absorbing a portion of the target’s memories and experiences.]\n[The Low Rank Bursting Thunder skill has become Lv6.]\n[The Low Rank Harden skill has become Lv2.]\n[The Intermediate Acid Poison Spray has become Lv2.]\n\"Mmm...\"\nDespite it being level 4, the King Slime didn’t give him as much magic as he had hoped. Was it because he had already hunted several other slimes and Great Slimes before?\nPerhaps his magic stat had increased far too much already, so it was difficult for the maximum value of his magic stat to increase any further.\n’Still, I’ll be level 4 soon. Let’s hang in there a little longer.’\nHe had gained karma and improved his stats through Bone Reinforcement, so now his stats totalled 756. As long as he gathered 44 more stats in the future, he would be reborn as a level 4. He tightened his fists, as if he realized how he was getting stronger more and more quickly.\n\"...It was good.\"\nFinally, he surveyed his surroundings. He thought there might be something he had missed and there really was. That was none other than the dungeon reward. Orıginal content can be found at novèlfire.net\n\"And now that I think about it, there was a message like that.\"\nIn a level 1 dungeon, the reward would be an old wooden box, but considering how it was a level 2 elite dungeon he’d cleared, there was a considerably sturdy and completely new looking wooden box that had appeared instead. Though the fact that it was a wooden box ultimately hadn’t changed!\n[20,000 Perium]\n[Low Rank Acid Resistance skill book]\n[Lv3 Grizzly Bone Leg (+1)]\n[Lv3 Melting War Axe]\nLee Shin Woo’s face paled once he checked the rewards. Should he says it’s as expected of an elite dungeon? Setting aside the Perium and the Acid Resistance skill book, he was rewarded with 2 level 3 items!\nMoreover, the Grizzly Bone Leg was lower body armor that completely covered his thighs, knees, legs, and even his feet; it was even made of bone.\n[Grizzly Bone Leg +1]\n[Lv3]\n[Durability: 740/740]\n[Defense: 105 - 115]\n[Options: Increases Strength by 5, Agility by 5]\n\"Now it’s perfect.\"\nHe had a helmet, upper body armor, and lower body armor that also doubled as combat boots. Though it was somewhat troubling that all of his defensive equipment was made of bone, at least people wouldn’t be able to tell that he was undead just from his exterior appearance now.\nWhen he banged on his lower body, which was completely covered up by the Grizzly Bone Leg, he sported a satisfied smile. He collected the Perium, and thought about reading the Low Rank Acid Resistance skill book on the spot... but decided against it.\n’Let’s give this to Jin.’\nWhen he thought about Jin, whose body couldn’t endure the Acid Ghoul’s poison and had been melted away, Lee Shin Woo decided it’d be better to give him the skill book, rather than raise his proficiency by a little bit. Then, he put the skill book into his inventory.\nThe problem was the final remaining item. The axe clearly gleamed in a metallic color, and it was so large that he wondered how it had fit inside the wooden box.\nJust by sitting still, the axe emitted a green mist, and because of that, the surrounding earth gradually melted away; seeing just that, he knew that it was an incredibly powerful weapon. That’s how he saw it, but...\n\"But it’s not made of bone...\"\nHe had to gamble after finally acquiring a level 3 item and change it into bone. Lee Shin Woo sighed deeply. However, there was nothing he could do about it. He couldn’t just leave it here!\n\"Heup.\"\n[Through Bone Reinforcement, the Melting War Axe is changing.]\nIn the end, he tightly gripped the axe with trembling hands. At that moment, that axe emitted a hair-raising sound and began to change into bone.\nBubbles surged up above the blade and the fundamental metal portion changed; the sequence of mana was newly formed, and the shape morphed. It was an extremely unpleasant process.\n\"Ha...?\"\nBut why? During that process, Lee Shin Woo felt as though his mana... or more precisely acid, was sucked into the axe. The weapon was radiating light, and the mana in the entire area resonated in that one spot, creating an even thicker mist.\nWhen the acid mist that the weapon spewed out became even thicker, and thus made it difficult to ascertain its very shape, the once thick mist in the periphery was suddenly sucked into the weapon.\nThe mist was completely lifted and the light likewise cleanly dissipated; for the first time, he was able to see the double-bladed axe which had transformed into bone.\n[You have acquired the Lv4 Melting Bone Double Axe.]\n[Melting Bone Double Axe]\n[Lv4]\n[Durability: 1,550/1,550]\n[Attack Power: 480 - 760]\n[Attribute: Acid Lv3]\n[Options: Strength +25, Agility -5, Effectiveness of Acid Attribute Skills + 20%]\n\"!?\"\nLee Shin Woo momentarily couldn’t believe his eyes, but when he thought about it, he didn’t even have eyes so there was no way he saw wrong.\nThe item really had leveled up. He had thought that this would happen sometime or another, but he didn’t actually think it would happen like this!\n’It didn’t level up just because I was lucky.’\nHe had realized when his magic transformed into Acid Poison and was sucked into the weapon just a little while ago.\nPerhaps during the process of transforming the weapon into bone through Bone Reinforcement, some other power that he had was somehow activated? And if that’s the case, wasn’t this proof that the stronger he got, the stronger the weapon that transformed through Bone Reinforcement would be?\n’It’s a really... really fearsome skill.’\nLee Shin Woo gritted his teeth at the countless abilities that Bone Reinforcement possessed. Perhaps this skill, depending on the karma, could affect the very rules of this world!\nThrough the use of countless experiences and memories, he learned a variety of abilities, and changed countless things through those abilities... His compatibility with the Joker karma was also great.\n\"But... Wait a second.\"\nWith this, he now had two level 4 items. And they were both items that would increase his acid attribute skills! If he combined the two items’ abilities, the power of his acid skills would increase by as much as 30%!\nLee Shin Woo tightly gripped the double axe and muttered satisfyingly. He could feel it. That even though it had calmed down, he could spew out a horrific concentration of Acid Poison whenever he wanted!\n\"If I use this well, I could even go with the Hydra concept...\"\nLee Shin Woo still couldn’t get rid of his habit from the Trickster quest.",

    "content": "<Chapter 10. Partner - 1>\n\"Did you wait a long time?\"\nIn just 13 hours, Jin had returned with the leather bag Lee Shin Woo had given him completely filled, speaking like a girlfriend who had arrived late to their meeting place. Of course, Lee Shin Woo didn’t even have a girlfriend before, so he wasn’t bothered at all and spoke.\n\"It’s alright, since I was busy reading this.\"\n\"What is it?\"\nLee Shin Woo raised and showed the bundle of papers to Jin, who carefully thrust his head forward; the edges of the papers were gradually weathering away and disappearing with every gust of wind. Jin likewise didn’t know the Empire’s language, but he could read the title of the documents without much difficulty.\n\"The Anti-Skull... Plan?\"\n\"You wanna read it?\"\n\"Yeah...\"\nOriginally, he didn’t really like reading very much, but Jin thought that there was something more to these papers than just a waste of time; yet he couldn’t joke like that as Lee Shin Woo’s face was much too serious.\nUltimately, he nodded his head, and Lee Shin Woo laid one of the papers on the ground, which best summarized the current state of affairs, so that he could read it easily. Lee Shin Woo then turned his head back to the papers. It was the last page.\n\"This is... Did the Empire have a force that knew about the impending curse and was preparing for it by any chance!?\"\n\"Ah, so you didn’t know.\"\nFor a few hours after clearing and leaving the dungeon, Lee Shin Woo thoroughly scrutinized the data he’d acquired from the sewer hidden facilities.\nAnti-Skull was lead by General Seagald, and was a group created to prevent the Emperor’s plan; at the same time, it was the name of the project that researched ways to prevent them from becoming undead.\n\"There’re detailed records written here about their research into preventing them from becoming undead. In laymen’s terms, at the heart of the research was their attempt to magically create a body beforehand which wouldn’t be affected by the curse.\"\n\"So what happened? Did they succeed?\"\n\"No.\"\nWas it because he was also undead? Jin asked in a deeply interested voice, and Lee Shin Woo replied firmly, cutting him off.\nThat’s right. The plan progressed in multiple ways, but all of them became frustrated. There were several cases where the tested individuals exploded, and it was common that their bodies wouldn’t even be able to use mana anymore.\nOn the contrary, this experiment with Acid Poison wasn’t bad. The test subjects didn’t die, and actually became stronger; though they degenerated into the undead, they were able to retain their memories and their reason as well.\n’Even if they meet humans, the current Pauls shouldn’t be driven by their hatred.’\nRegardless of their intent, all undead hated humans. It was like a suggestion engraved into their instincts. Because of that, humans also consider undead enemies. Though Lee Shin Woo didn’t really know about it since he was an undead as soon as he arrived in the Empire!\n’I wonder what state General Seagald is in?’\nBased on the reports, General Seagald was gathering forces through various means to prevent the Emperor’s plan, while also actively participating in the Anti-Skull’s experiments with his subordinates.\nIn the past, he opposed the Emperor and certainly raised a force, but considering how he couldn’t prevent the curse despite that, his rebellion must’ve failed in the end. What happened to him as a result? Was he still alive, surviving as an undead? If he’s still alive, what would be the state of his reasoning?\nThe day would come where he’d be able to figure this out. Lee Shin Woo didn’t really need to take the lead and figure it out himself. Since there were a lot of seniors already ahead of him.\n\"Do the other heroes know about this?\"\n\"Wouldn’t they? I don’t really have any plans to check, but they probably do.\"\nOf course, he had coincidentally learned of Anti-Skull in the sewer dungeon, but there were various secret facilities hidden throughout the Empire. If he assumed that the majority of them had become dungeons, a portion of his seniors should’ve been able to find them already. At least, that’s what Lee Shin Woo thought.\n\"You did some quests, right?\"\n\"I got the inventory and the chatting channel as well.\"\nAs if he were demonstrating, Jin put the leather bag in and out of his inventory. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and took the bag.\nThere were different bones that filled the bag to the brim, and they were all bones from at least level 2 monsters, just like Lee Shin Woo had instructed. Rarely, he saw some level 3 bones as well.\n\"How was your hunt?\"\n\"When I actually got started, it wasn’t that hard. It felt like I got a bit used to battle in just a few hours. ...Yeah, laugh it up.\"\n\"Nah, it’s normally like that.\"\nLee Shin Woo finished inspecting the bones and raised his head, locking gazes with Jin. His face, which blazed with blue goblin fire, came right in front of his own.\n\"Now you’re going to accept me as your colleague, right?\"\n\"Of course. However, there’s something I’d like to check before that. What’s the ability you got from God as you were dropped onto this world?\"\n\"Mmm, that’s... well you’re undead too, so I guess it’s fine to tell you.\"\nJin was briefly conflicted, but soon he scanned Lee Shin Woo’s body and slightly nodded his head, and opened his mouth for the second time. In a way, Lee Shin Woo had anticipated what he had to say, but at the same time, his expectations were completely off.\n\"Truthfully, I have an ability that revives me even if I die. It’s an ability called the Blessing of Death; the magic of the curse is absorbed, and the accumulated power is changed into a blessing. Even if I die, it makes it possible for me to revive.\"\n\"The magic of the curse? Ah.\"\n\"Yeah, that’s why I’m accumulating magic even now. It’s not very much, though...\"\nThe curse’s magic, which transformed people into the undead, was overflowing in this world right now. In exchange for Jin having no curse resistance, his skill took care of it. It was a complete surprise to Lee Shin Woo, who thought Jin would definitely have the ’Invisible Heart’ like him.\n\"Though the magic I’ve accumulated is only enough to revive me twice.\"\n\"So the reason you just constantly ran was because of that skill’s effect, huh.\"\n\"It’s embarrassing, but... yeah.\"\nLee Shin Woo felt refreshed. He had thought that no matter how depressed Jin was from becoming a Skeleton Horse, just constantly running was too much, but after learning about his ability, he realized that Jin had run to stockpile the necessary energy to activate his skill.\n\"I’ve already died once, so I’ve become afraid of dying again. I couldn’t tell Jin Jin, but that’s how it is. I’m pathetic, right?\"\n\"No, I understand. Very sincerely.\"\nThe reason Lee Shin Woo could decide to fight without much difficulty as soon as he was dropped into the Empire was because he could revive 99 times. If he had arrived with the same skill Jin had, he would’ve done the same as him.\n’In any case, when I compare his ability to mine, it’s kind of subtle.’\nAfter listening to him, it seemed as though Jin’s ability didn’t have a limited number of uses, but it also seemed like Jin’s ability would require him to gather a tremendous amount of mana to activate the skill.\nIn other words, he could futilely die before he gathered the required mana if he was unlucky. That probably contributed to him becoming more of a coward. He suddenly thought that God was truly ill-tempered.\n\"What about curse resistance and holy resistance?\"\n\"I have both of them. They’re maxed out. It seems like my curse absorption is the evolved form of maxed out curse resistance.\"\n\"As I thought.\"\nHis absorption was the evolved form of maxed curse resistance... Lee Shin Woo decided he’d store away that information for now, and nodded his head. Jin felt relieved when he saw Lee Shin Woo unperturbed and nodding his head, even after hearing about his revival ability.\n\"So you received an ability similar to mine, huh. I wondered whether I was the only one like this.\"\n\"Yeah, though my revival conditions are a bit different.\"\nLee Shin Woo explained the effects of Invisible Heart to him. Jin could’ve been really uncomfortable hearing it, but he didn’t want to lie to someone he sympathized with. As expected, Jin was jealous of him.\n\"You have 97 more lives!? I’m so jealous...!\"\n\"But the number of lives is annoying. So my goal right now is to die as little as possible. Acting as though I only have one life, and that I’m not undead.\"\n\"...Yeah, I agree with you.\"\nFrom the start, Lee Shin Woo’s attitude was something that Jin also wanted to learn. That attitude, where he didn’t succumb to despair and endured firmly, despite being in a similar situation, and pressing forward!\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo seemed burdened by Jin’s blazing gaze (though in reality, it was always blazing), and slightly turned his head away and spoke.\n\"That’s not all, right? Isn’t there more that you got?\"\n\"Ah, yeah... In the process of becoming a Skeleton Horse, or more precisely, a [Dark Bone Horse], I became level 4. And lastly, I got a skill called [Child of Light].\"\n\"What’s that? Does it let you kick at the speed of light or something?\"\nAmongst the several lines he’d always wanted to say, Lee Shin Woo mentioned one of them. Jin then cold-heartedly shook his head and spoke.\n\"By receiving the Blessing of Light, my agility growth rate increases by three times.\"\n\"...Growth rate is kind of vague, so what does it mean in more detail?\"\nEven as he thought that Jin should be called the Child of Char[1] instead of the Child of Light, he asked for more details. Without hesitating, Jin elaborated. Without even realizing how amazing his own ability was.\n\"Whenever I gain agility, for whatever the reason, I gain three agility when others gain 1. That’s my karma or whatever.\"\n\"Whatever the reason...!?\"\nThat’s bullshit! Three times the agility no matter what? Increases in agility from karma, skills, and drinking the shop’s medicine would be three times that of any other person! Though it was a cheat skill he could gain only after becoming a Skeleton Horse.\n\"It seems like it’s an ability that’s so good that it surprises even you. Well, my agility did shoot up as I continually ran, when my skills leveled up, or when I received some karma for running really fast. I feel like my agility was around 500 at the beginning, but right now it’s close to 800.\"\n\"800!?\"\nHe already surpassed Lee Shin Woo with just his agility! Now he could understand his fearsome growth rate. If he were to exclude the increase in effectiveness of his other stats, he already had agility that rivaled a level 6’s!\n’Wait a sec.’\nAt that point, Lee Shin Woo suddenly thought. If that’s the case, then would his ability activate when he reinforces his bones, too...?\nIf that’s actually true, then his compatibility with Jin would result in an absurd outcome beyond his imagination. Jin could naturally attain a tremendous result, and Lee Shin Woo fighting in battle from his back...!\n’Did God not expect this?’\nThese two unusual individuals’ karma met and would create a ridiculous synergistic effect. If it’s her, who was the God of this world, she probably could’ve predicted this.\nIf that’s the case, then God had predicted that they’d work together at some point... and there’s a possibility that she’d guided them such that they would. She didn’t just make them undead simply due to her ill nature, but perhaps she wanted them to accomplish the tasks that ’couldn’t be accomplished by normal humans’.\n...Though she could’ve just done it on a whim.\n\"Do you also have a different ability?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nHe was in deep thought, so he forgot that Jin was right in front of him. He saw Jin waiting for his response, and extracted a level 2 bone from the leather bag; he raised it, smiled mischievously (that kind of feeling), and replied.\n\"Yeah, I do have one. From the start, all of my abilities are because of this skill.\"\n\"What kind of ability could it be for it to...?\"\n\"I’ll teach you using your own body.\"\n\"What...!?\"\n\"Be careful, since your head might hurt in the beginning.\"\nFor some reason, Jin was shocked and stepped back, but Lee Shin Woo wasn’t concerned by that and yelled.\n\"Bone Reinforcement!\" Follow current novᴇls on novel•fire.net\n[1] T/N: Char is a character from Mobile Suit Gundam.

    "content": "<Chapter 10. Partner - 2>\nThis was his first time using his Bone Reinforcement on someone else, so even though he seemingly used the skill without hesitation, he was actually quite anxious. Sure enough, messages instantly appeared in front of him, crowding his sight.\n[Reinforcing Hero—Jin Taylor’s shoulder bone. Determining the target’s suitability. Check successful.

You also share a portion of the experiences and memories and are absorbing them.]\n[I’ll become the one of the 12 generals someday. My mum said that if I eat like this every day, I’ll become a general. - Nameless Soldier]\n\"Ugh...!?\"\n\"It’s not too bad. Just relax and take it all in.\"\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo activated the skill, Jin was startled and started quivering; Lee Shin Woo calmed him down and checked each and every message that appeared.\n’Determining suitability, huh... As expected, it wasn’t something that I could use on just anyone. I can probably only use it on undead, and amongst the undead, only the ones that are made entirely of bone. But what’s this contract thing?’\nPerhaps the faint string of mana that connected him and Jin the moment he activated the skill signified the contract. He didn’t feel any negative energy from it, so as long as he was concious of it in the future, it would be fine.\nHe didn’t know if it was because of the contract, but despite the skill being used on Jin, Lee Shin Woo was likewise able to absorb a portion of the zombie’s memories and experiences.\nOf course, it was much less compared to if he had used it on himself, but... it was at that moment that he realized that using his Bone Reinforcement on other people wasn’t a complete loss on his part.\n’If that’s the case, there’s no reason to hesitate on using the skill on Jin.’\nThe instant Lee Shin Woo used his Bone Reinforcement, he ruminated over the zombie’s memories that had been engraved into his brain, and gazed at Jin. As expected, the small blue goblin fire that blazed within his eye sockets mercilessly shook.\n\"This is... No, wait, ugh...!\"\n\"You asked me how I got so skilled in such a short amount of time, didn’t you? This is my answer.\"\nHe definitely had a lot of things he wanted to say. Jin’s mouth opened and closed, and he looked like he was about to say something when Lee Shin Woo spoke, with a slight amount of self-scorn in his voice.\n\"My talent, experiences, and everything is due to this skill.\"\n\"You, this... you sure are...\"\nWas it because this was his first time experiencing Bone Reinforcement, and it wasn’t easy to escape its effect? Jin tottered around as if he had become drunk.\nLee Shin Woo patiently waited until he calmed down and could stand up straight. He waited approximately 5 minutes before Jin narrowly sighed, raised his head, and spat out as if he had chewed on something foul.\n\"...It was a horrific experience.\"\n\"Not a great experience?\"\nOf course, if such vivid memories melded into one’s brain, there’s a chance they’ll be confused. However, if he showed such a violent reaction to it, wouldn’t it make one want to tease him? As expected, Jin heard Lee Shin Woo, shivered, and replied.\n\"Ugh... I feel sick. How many times have you experienced this exactly?\"\n\"Do you remember each and every piece of food you’ve ever eaten?\"\n\"You’re crazy! ...But now I understand how you got so strong.\"\nFor Jin, taking in another person’s experiences and memories felt similar to his brain itself being injected with a foreign substance. Even though he knew this would be helpful to him, it wasn’t something he was able to do so easily.\nHowever, if he backed down here and now, Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t help him. Perhaps this was the real test... at least, that’s what Jin thought.\n\"I’m telling you. You’ll get used to it soon enough. Then, let’s move on to the next one, ok?\"\n\"Ugh... O-One sec.\"\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo didn’t really have any plans to test Jin. From the start, Lee Shin Woo passed over his moans and groans as him making a big fuss over nothing, and chose the next bone to step up to the plate.\nIt wasn’t really him having a wicked personality or anything; he truly believed that there was no way Jin would be this anguished from just this.\n\"If you get past about 10 of them, your head will get dizzy, but if you focus and keep hold of your consciousness, the only thing that’ll hurt is your head, and it won’t be too much of a problem. You just have to take in what you need from them and make it yours. It’s simple, right?\"\n\"...Can’t you at least take it a bit slower?\"\n\"Fine then.\"\nJin finally resolved himself. In order for him to become stronger, and to catch up to Lee Shin Woo by even just a little, he had no choice but to accept this and to endure!\n’I’m sure of it now. If I work together with Lee Shin Woo, I can become strong...! I can’t just weakly stay where I am any longer!’\nLee Shin Woo thought Jin would be disappointed in him after hearing about his ability, but it was actually the opposite. To Jin, Lee Shin Woo was someone who had an overwhelming willpower, and Jin considered him as someone strong, someone who would fight regardless of what body he was in or whatever the method in this world.\nAnd what he was seeking was that steel will. So, it wouldn’t do if he couldn’t even endure this much!\n[By consuming a Lv2 Skeleton Warrior’s arm bone, Jin Taylor’s bones are being reinforced.]\n[By consuming a Lv3 Ghoul Fighter’s shinbone...]\n...\n...\n[By consuming a Lv3 Metal Bone Snake’s rib bone, Jin Taylor’s bones are being reinforced. Jin Taylor is absorbing a portion of the target’s experiences and memories. You also share a portion of its experiences and memories and are absorbing them. Health has increased by 1.]\nThere were 513 bones in total in the bag, and among them, close to 450 of them were level 2 bones; the rest were level 3 bones. Lee Shin Woo spent about five hours to allow Jin to absorb all of them, but the fact that just absorbing half of the effects increased his own stats by 10 was telling of just how many bones there were.\n\"Ugh, I feel like I’ll vomit...\"\nAs a result of absorbing all of the owners’ various memories and experiences, Jin laid his huge body on his back and was dry heaving.\nSince Lee Shin Woo was the pioneer of this specific field and fully utilized his know-how of maintaining his consciousness, most of the confusion had passed, but even so, if one were to ask if it were easy to overcome the aftermath, the answer would definitely be ’no’. Lee Shin Woo gazed stiffly at Jin and consoled him.\n\"It’s alright. Since we have nothing to barf out anyway.\"\n\"You demon! I told you to do it slowly!\"\n\"If I had absorbed these myself, I could’ve done it in 30 minutes.\"\n\"...\"\nJin meekly closed his mouth, suppressed his nausea, and quietly stood up. The fact that his body still lightly shook was kind of funny. Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and asked him a question. Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn novel{f}ire.net\n\"So, how was it? Do you feel a bit ’experienced’ now?\"\n\"Though it definitely feels like a lot has changed, it’s difficult to say what exactly has changed right now. I feel like it’ll be difficult to figure out what’s changed until I actually get into a fight... Moreover, I received way too many peoples’ memories all at once, so I’m dizzy. Give me some time to organize it all.\"\nThey were words that caused him to automatically nod his head. Originally, just using Bone Reinforcement isn’t the end; that’s because after the reinforcement is over, in the process of moving their body, they need to completely learn these skills through experience.\nThen, it would be better to check something he could get a feel for right now that served as proof: the numbers.\n\"How much have your stats increased?\"\n\"Strength by 7, Agility by 13, Health by 8, and Magic by 5. ...They’ve definitely gone up by a lot.\"\n\"To me, the most shocking thing is the fact that your agility, which is already over 800, went up by 13.\"\nIt might’ve been obvious, but the higher the level, and the higher the stats, the more difficult it becomes to increase one’s stats. Despite that, the stat that showed the most growth for Jin was his agility...\n\"You said that you need 1,600 stats to become level 5, right? I have a total of 1,400 stats right now, so... If we do this a few more times, I should get to level 5, right?\"\n\"It’s not that simple. If you absorb a monster’s bone that you’ve already absorbed before, its effect lessens more and more. The reason I asked you to fill that bag to the brim and come back was because I calculated that with roughly this many bones, the effectiveness wouldn’t drop.\"\n\"Ugh...\"\nJin could do nothing but nod in response. The more the reinforcement was repeated, the more the stat growth from the bones would gradually lessen, and in the end, they pretty much wouldn’t ever increase.\n\"Then what you’re saying is...?\"\n\"Yeah. We have to hunt monsters befitting our level. If it’s possible, the monsters of a higher level than us, too.\"\n\"But it’s tougher the higher level the monster is because their memories are denser!\"\n\"Isn’t that better?\"\n\"No way. If I don’t do something about this guy, then...!\"\nLee Shin Woo snickered at Jin, who was gritting his teeth and spoke.\n\"For the time being, I want to focus on my own reinforcement. Will that be ok with you? Because I think it’d be better if our levels matched.\"\n\"Alright. Then, for the time being, I won’t use that skill.\"\n\"Good work.\"\n\"...T-Then...\"\nWas he shaking off his dizziness? Jin extremely carefully turned to his side and spoke to Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Can you get on?\"\n\"Yeah, I think I can.\"\nIt seemed obvious, but he had never really ridden on horseback when he lived in Korea. Even when he did, it was only on a high school trip to Jeju Island, and he had gotten help then. The appearance of his friend’s horse, galloping in front of him while pooping had left a deep impression on him...\n\"It’s a relief that you’re undead.\"\n\"You wanna go?\"\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo had the memories of the countless soldiers and knight aspirants who were active in the past Empire. It hadn’t become a skill yet, but if he rode...\n\"Umhp, as I thought. It feels like it’ll work.\"\n\"Ugh...\"\nAfter he had somehow gotten atop Jin, Lee Shin Woo successfully maintained his balance even without a saddle. His dormant experiences were given shape and were aiding him. Sure enough, immediately after, he got a message that he’d acquired a skill!\n[You have learned the passive skill, Low Rank Horseback Riding Lv1. Agility has increased by 5. You can draw out the full potential of what you ride. The higher the level, the higher the buffs while riding in battle.]\nThough each memory one by one wasn’t enough, the combination of the countless hoarded memories and experiences had manifested into a low rank skill. Moreover, he had acquired additional stats from it!\nWhen he thought that perhaps other skills lay dormant and were buried like this one, Lee Shin Woo felt great.\n\"Nice, Jin. Let’s go.\"\n\"...Yeah. I’m a horse. I’m just a Skeleton Horse...\"\nWhen he saw Jin, who was self-suggesting that he was a horse, Lee Shin Woo just laughed again. He had thought Jin had resolved himself by now, but it seemed like he still wasn’t prepared. If he were in his position, he would feel just as agonized right now, so he could definitely understand him.\n\"Hoo... Alright. Where should we go?\"\n\"For starters, let’s take a lap around this city and check if there’s anything we missed.\"\n\"Ok.\"\nJin weakly nodded and began to move. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo felt his body rapidly lean backward and was shocked, and grabbed tightly onto Jin. The surrounding landscape quickly passed by him, and it felt like he was time traveling!\n\"Hey!?\"\n\"You wasted time because of me, so let’s quickly look back and go!\"\n\"If you keep running this fast, the only thing I’ll be able to look back at is my previous lifeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!\"\nHowever, Jin didn’t listen to him. Ultimately, it took Lee Shin Woo a few hours before he was somehow able to distinguish the surrounding objects clearly while Jin was running, and it soon developed into him training his Combat Sprint and Horseback Riding skills.",

Your instantaneous acceleration, as well as dynamic visual acuity increase proportionally to your agility.]\n[The Low Rank Horseback Riding skill has become Lv3. Agility has increased by 1. By communicating with what you’re riding, you can control it more easily.]\nHow long had he been holding out on top of Jin’s back? At the end of this rigorous albeit short period of time, his extreme training resulted in his Low Rank Horseback Riding skill to rise to level 3; Lee Shin Woo’s and Jin’s senses were very gradually starting to overlap as a result.\n\"Ugh!?\"\n\"Hoo, I feel like I’ll survive now.\"\nSince their senses had started to overlap, Jin had no choice but to slow down his pace. If he ran at a speed beyond Lee Shin Woo’s ability, then he would start feeling dizzy as well!\n\"Wouldn’t it be better if you didn’t level up your skill!?\"\n\"No, since you’ve been running around like you’ve been lugging around a package on your back. You’ve been running up until now like a freight train and now you’ve barely ’class changed’ into a trolley, you know?\"\nWhen they began to converse, Jin definitely slowed down for the first time, and it was a speed that Lee Shin Woo was likewise able to bear for the first time. To be honest, if he didn’t use his Combat Sprint to its very limit, even this speed would’ve been too fast for him, but in any case, it was important that he was able to endure it.\n\"It’s too slow. I’m bored...\"\n\"For me, it still seems like the surrounding landscape is passing by a little too fast...\"\nBy the time he noticed, they were near where Jin started running. In other words, in a few hours, they were able to run a lap around the city! ...No, it might’ve even been a few laps.\n\"We haven’t found anything yet. Let’s take another lap.\"\n\"It can’t be helped I guess...\"\nJin began to sprint again. For the first time, Lee Shin Woo realized that he was riding atop a horse and galloping away, and started to survey his surroundings.\nEver since he had acquired Mana Bone, his mana senses had become more sensitive, and after using these senses to search the area, there was something that stood out immediately. From behind at that.\n\"Hey, the undead are following behind us!\"\n\"It’s only natural that they’d be following us around like that. After all, we’ve been running around in the same city, and on the same route. Honestly, while we were travelling around the city, I got rid of a few of them.\"\nHearing Jin’s calm response, it seemed like this wasn’t his first or second time doing something like this. Well, all this guy did was run until now, so it made sense that he’d have experience with the undead chasing behind him.\nBy running around the city, Jin had gathered all of the undead, and managed to gather them all into one group; such control was amazing.\n\"Hey, have you thought about talking with them?\"\n\"What kind of conversation could I have with monsters like them!?\"\nThis won’t do. This guy’s head isn’t normal! He’s been just idiotically running away from them, even though they were also undead; if he just lied to them, he would’ve been able to pass by without incident!\nLee Shin Woo just shook his head, but he didn’t realize that he was in actuality, the one who was strange between the two. After all, not everyone could obtain the Acting skill.\n\"There’s no good way of kiting the mobs... Wait. Kiting the mobs?\"\n\"...I don’t really know what that means, but why does it feel slightly ominous?\"\nKiting mobs was a term commonly used in RPG settings; when it was too troublesome to hunt down the monsters one by one, a nimble player would aggro all the mobs in the area, gathering them all into one group.\nIf they worked together with a class who could use wide area skills, their effectiveness would increase by an absurd margin, and right now, Lee Shin Woo had...\n\"Alright, let’s take care of them and then move on.\"\n\"Ugh, as I thought...\"\nHumans could always turn danger into an opportunity to grow. Lee Shin Woo naturally turned around. No, to be exact, when he thought about wanting to turn around, his will was relayed to Jin, and Jin instinctually turned his body around. The effects of the leveled up Horseback Riding skill were definitely showing.\n\"Guh, this feels really weird.\"\n\"Sorry, but try to bear with it since it’ll help in battle from now on.\"\nAs he spoke, he thoroughly surveyed the surrounding area. While he desperately endured so that he wouldn’t fall off from Jin’s back, Jin had very shrewdly drawn all of the mobs, so they were clumped in one place; the undead chasing after them numbered at least several thousand.\nThey were mostly skeletons, but he quite frequently saw Ghouls mixed in, as well as animals and monsters which had died and become undead. But since zombies were so slow, they lagged behind in the back.\n\"So you drew all the undead in this city, huh.\"\n\"It seems like it’s the undead’s nature. When the mob begins to gather, they cause a commotion, and that commotion causes other undead to gather as well; when they get a hold of themselves, they seem to form a huge group like that.\"\nSeeing the calmly replying Jin, the stunned Lee Shin Woo seemed to blurt out.\n\"If a newbie hero was unlucky enough to get involved during that process, they would’ve died right there.\"\n\"T-That’s... I didn’t think there’d be any other heroes besides me...\"\n\"No, it’s fine as long as you don’t do it from now on. You won’t need to do it from now on either.\"\nLee Shin Woo raised his hand, extended his index finger, and aimed at the undead that were grouped together in one place while also chasing after them. Then, Jin asked doubtfully.\n\"I know how powerful your skill is, but will you hit them with it...? You’re still at least 1 kilometer away. Should I get closer?\"\n\"No, it’s fine. Since I have something I need to prep before I shoot it.\"\nThe first skill Lee Shin Woo had to activate wasn’t his Catapult skill, but his Acid Poison Spray skill. Thıs content belongs to NoveIꜰire.net\nOf course, he wasn’t talking about spraying his Acid Poison everywhere. He recollected how the Acid Ghoul and the King Slime concentrated their Acid Poison into a single point, and focused his attention on the tip of his index finger. The poison, which converted into mana, began to gather at that single point!\n[Guwoooh...]\n\"They’re gradually getting closer.\"\n\"I’m almost done.\"\nIf he hadn’t acquired the Mana Bone skill, which was considerably helpful in processing the mana that saturated his bones, it would’ve taken a considerable amount of effort to complete the task. The skill made the difficulty of controlling his Acid Poison much simpler.\n\"Good, then.\"\nLee Shin Woo pushed all of the Acid Poison he could into the tip of his index finger, and next, activated his Flames of Revenge. Poison on the inside, flames on the outside!\nWith his know-how, just like last time, he focused on his flames, and those flames darkened to their limit; it felt as if there was dark matter in that space. At the same time, he also saw the presence of the flames disappear, as if the middle of his index finger had been cut off.\n[The Low Rank Flames of Revenge skill has become Lv2. Magic has increased by 3. The diffusion force of the flames has increased.]\nWas it because he concentrated the skill into one place? It had been a long time since his Flames of Revenge had leveled up. At the same time, the flames blazing atop his index finger intensified. It was at that moment that Lee Shin Woo figured out a new way of training his skill.\n\"I don’t have flame resistance, though.\"\nJin started to feel a gradually increasing heat from atop his back, and shook as if he were uneasy. Because of the Acid Poison Resistance skill book he had received from Lee Shin Woo, he learned Acid Poison Resistance and was able to resist Acid Poison to some degree, but he wasn’t resistant to this level of fire!\n\"It doesn’t burn allies, so don’t worry. Then... I’m firing it!\"\n\"Ugh...\"\nLee Shin Woo’s index finger was launched with a simple, weak sound. Just by seeing that, Jin looked like he himself was hurt by it, but Lee Shin Woo was accustomed to this kind of pain now, and didn’t even feel an itch.\nHe checked the trajectory that his index finger drew in the air, and nodded his head in satisfaction. It was flying towards the center of the group of several thousand undead.\n\"How many of them do you think you’ll kill with that?\"\n\"All of them.\"\n\"All of them?\"\n\"Yeah. As long as I take one more step.\"\n\"What step...\"\nJin thought he was out of his mind, but when Jin tilted his head, Lee Shin Woo’s Grenade had arrived at the center of the group of undead; with his command to self-destruct, it exploded grandly. At that moment it burst forth with a fearsome force of flames and poison!\n[Kuaaaaahk!]\n[Kihiiiiiiiiiiiiii!]\nHundreds of level 1 undead at the center disappeared without even being able to scream, and even the level 2 and higher undead took significant damage. Moreover, since the poison and the flames had the quality of diffusing into the surrounding area, they were quickly expanding to encompass them within their range!\n\"Oh jeez, even the mana that’s escaping is no joke.\"\n\"That attack was definitely incredible, but what are you going to do now!? Even if they’re low leveled, there’re several thousands of them!\"\n\"So what we’re going to do now is...\"\nLee Shin Woo measured the distance between them and the monsters. It was roughly 300 meters. Even by human standards, it wasn’t very far, and it was a distance that quick monsters would be able to reach in only a few seconds.\n\"Cover your ears.\"\n\"I don’t have any ears, and I don’t even have hands to cover them.\"\n\"Well, I guess it can’t be helped. Tough it out.\"\nAnd sound could travel the distance in only a second.\n\"Kill yourselvessssssssssssssssssssssss!\"\n[You used Low Rank Shriek of the Dead, and the enemies in the entire area fall into a frenzied and fearful state!]\n[You have succeeded in using the skill while engaging more than 1000 foes! You have acquired a large amount of skill proficiency. The Low Rank Shriek of the Dead has become Lv5. Magic has increased by 3. The skill’s effect has become stronger, and the skill can affect a larger area.]\n\"Urgh!\"\nJin screamed in anguish from Lee Shin Woo’s momentary, horrific shriek. However, since Jin was Lee Shin Woo’s ally, he wasn’t affected by the skill in the least. Because of that, it took him a bit of time to realize the effect of the skill.\n\"What the hell are you doing all of a sudden... Huh?\"\nJin abruptly shouted, and then quickly scanned his surroundings. The group of undead, which looked furious and would dash at them at first chance, didn’t approach them anymore. To be more exact, they weren’t worried about Lee Shin Woo or Jin any longer.\n[Enemies. To think that there are this many enemies...!]\n[My body is made of bones...!]\n[Haha, I’ll kill all the enemies of the Imperial Army!]\n[Kyahaaaaahk!]\nThey each spat out a peculiar noise then stabbed with their swords, and swung their clubs at each other; seeing that, Jin looked puzzled and asked Lee Shin Woo.\n\"That’s... What the hell is this?\"\n\"The best tactic for not smearing your own hands with blood is using your enemies to defeat themselves. This’ll show up on the test, so make sure you remember it.\"\n\"...\"\nWhile Jin was speechless, the monsters fought intensely amongst themselves, confirming Lee Shin Woo’s statement.\nFurthermore, the monsters didn’t really wander, and fought in around the same area, so the flames and the poison soon covered the entire battlefield. Thousands of monsters were being harmed by the DoT damage in real time.\n\"It probably wouldn’t be very effective against high level monsters, but at least it’s not out of my reach to slaughter a mob of monsters now. As expected, you can only do it with a large-scale ability.\"\n\"A large-scale ability...\"\nWhy doesn’t a level 3 skeleton have so many frightening abilities!? However, if he said that, it was obvious that Lee Shin Woo would just tell him it was all due to Bone Reinforcement, and that he should work harder, so Jin just kept his mouth shut.\nWhile Jin kept his mouth shut, Lee Shin Woo concentrated on drawing the surrounding mana in order to recover the mana he was using to maintain his Flames of Revenge. The mana instantaneously entered and escaped him, so it was as if his entire body had become a passageway for mana.\n[Gu...aah...]\n[My... wife...]\nLee Shin Woo was busy harmonizing with the mana, so he didn’t notice the passage of time, but honestly, everything was finished within 20 minutes.\nThe zombies, which arrived late, completely merged with the group, and the flames shifted and latched onto them. After they died horribly, they left Perium and bones in their place, and when all the undead had completely disappeared... a message appeared in front of Lee Shin Woo, one he hadn’t expected at all.\n[You have removed all the death within the city, ’Derita’. Though you haven’t removed the curse, all the death energy in the entire area has faded, so no more undead will spawn in this area.]\n[You have acquired 1 permit for God’s Secret Shop. You have acquired 10,000 Perium. The proficiency of all your combat related skills increases.]\n[The Beginner Avenger skill has become Lv8. When you meet the target of your revenge again, all abilities increase by 36%. The Beginner Power Slash skill has become Lv9. The power of the skill increases.]\nOf those, Lee Shin Woo’s attention lingered upon the message that appeared last.\n[You have proven your qualification as a hero who lifts the darkness underground as a substitute of God’s will. You have acquired the Hero’s karma token. The growth rate of all skills increases by 10%. If you gather 10 of these tokens, you will become a true hero... but what a shame, it seems like this would be impossible for you.]\n\"Impossible, huh...\"\n\"What’s wrong?\"\nIt seems that because Lee Shin Woo was the one who mostly ’purified’ this city, Jin didn’t receive this message. Lee Shin Woo replied like this to his question.\n\"It’s nothing. It seems like I can’t be a hero.\"\n\"What are talking about all of a sudden?\"\nLee Shin Woo just shrugged his shoulders and smiled. Whenever he got a karma token up until now, he would obtain a stat increase as well, but this time, he received a blessing that would increase his skill growth by 10% instead. He couldn’t hold back his curiosity of what would happen if he obtained just one more token.\nHowever, was it good or bad that he had become unable to gather all of them...? Even though he felt slightly complicated inside, he moved to collect all the loot with Jin. Right now, he needed to do what he could.",

    "content": "<Chapter 10. Partner - 4>\nLee Shin Woo used the bones they had collected on site and reinforced himself. Of course, level 1 bones were almost meaningless to him now, but he still repeatedly used Bone Reinforcement until he saw the phrase, [You have acquired all the experiences and memories that you could from XXX.]. He couldn’t miss the opportunity to grow even a little bit more!\n\"Bone Reinforcement, Bone Reinforcement, Bone Reinforcement...\"\n\"Ugh.\"\nJin just got tired of seeing Lee Shin Woo continuously use Bone Reinforcement in place without pause. It wasn’t a joke when Lee Shin Woo said that he could finish off 513 bones within 30 minutes. No, it was actually much worse.\nIn less than 1 second, he sorted out the bones he would absorb, then grabbed several of them at a time and activated Bone Reinforcement; it wasn’t difficult for him to dispose of 100 bones within 1 minute.\n\"Bone Reinforcement... Oh, I’m done now.\"\n\"You... Are you really human!?\"\n\"Can’t you see I’m a skeleton? You want a piece of me?\"\nAs a result, Lee Shin Woo absorbed close to three thousand bones and left behind about one thousand of them, as he couldn’t acquire anymore memories, experiences, and abilities from them. It didn’t even take an hour.\n[Lee Shin Woo]\n[Dark Skeleton Avenger]\n[Treasure Hunter and 1 other]\n[Lv - 3 (Stat Effectiveness 125%)]\n[Strength - 160 Agility - 169 Health - 164 Magic - 305]\n[Passive Skills - Invisible Heart Lv3, Acting Lv6, Beginner Avenger Lv8, Low Rank Bursting Thunder Lv7, Low Rank Mana Bone Lv6, Low Rank Stealth Lv6, Low rank Command Lv1, Low Rank Horseback Riding Lv4]\n[Active Skills - Bone Reinforcement Lv4, Low Rank Combat Sprint Lv8, Low Rank Shriek of the Dead Lv5, Low Rank Regeneration Lv2, Low Rank Catapult Lv3, Low Rank Flames of Revenge Lv2, Beginner Power Slash Lv9, Low Rank Harden Lv3, Low Rank Self-Destruct Lv2, Sacrifice Lv1, Intermediate Acid Poison Spray Lv2]\n[Resistances - Holy: MAX, Curse: MAX, Acid: Low Rank Lv8, Ice: Intermediate Lv1]\n\"Man, I’m short a couple of stats so I can’t level up.\"\n\"So your stats don’t go up even if you absorb three thousand bones, huh...\"\n\"No, it’s the opposite. It’s actually gone up this much.\"\nAmongst the four thousand monsters Lee Shin Woo disposed of, there were basically no level 3 monsters. In other words, the absolute majority of the monsters were a lower level than him, so the fact that his stats rose by even this much was amazing. It was because Lee Shin Woo had ignorantly pushed ahead with quantity over quality.\n\"What are you going to do with the rest? I’m telling you ahead of time, but it’s impossible for me. I can’t, no way.\"\n\"You sure are cowardly. Don’t worry, they all have a use.\"\nLee Shin Woo took out a huge bag from his inventory, shoved the hundreds of level 1 bones into it, and stamped onto the bag with all his might. Seeing that, Jin was stunned and tackled him.\n\"Is it for stress relief?\"\n\"No, it’s for healing.\"\nHe continued to stamp on the bag and nodded his head once he saw the contents within turn into a fine powder. Looking at the bag filled with fine bone powder, he felt like he was rich.\n\"For healing...?\"\n\"Yeah. If you turn these into powder, all of the properties of the bones equalize, and though you become unable to acquire the memories or experiences within, the healing ability remains. Moreover, you can apply it to your entire body, so it’s an advantage.\"\n\"Ah.\"\nJin had already experienced it, so he was well aware that Bone Reinforcement healed the portion of the body that it was applied to. In other words, Lee Shin Woo was processing the remaining bones, which he couldn’t obtain anymore experiences or memories from, and turning them into medicine! It was also advantageous in that he could conveniently store it into his inventory now. Google seaʀᴄh novel✦fire.net\n\"I have the Regeneration skill, so I don’t really need it, but it should be important for you.\"\n\"You’re being so considerate I feel like I’ll cry.\"\n\"Now then, let’s...\"\nThe remaining 200 bones were level 2 undead bones; it felt like too much of a waste to turn them into powder, so he didn’t.\nBut when he told Jin to use them, Jin responded that it’d be too much for him right now; therefore, he only had one other option.\nIt was none other than weapon reinforcement.\n’Bone of Thunder Lasting is at +8 right now, and I only have one more level 3 weapon reinforcement permit. In order for it to reach +10 and be reborn as a level 4 weapon, one of the reinforcements have to succeed.’\nHe gave up on the level 1 bones and weapons as he didn’t think it would have any chance of succeeding with them, but what about level 2 bones? Wouldn’t there be at least a slight chance? Jin saw Lee Shin Woo tremble as he grabbed a level 2 bone, and thought he looked like a gambling addict.\n\"...Bone Reinforcement.\"\n[Reinforcement has failed.]\n[Reinforcement has failed.]\n[Reinforcement has failed.]\nThe heap of bones they had acquired disappeared in an instant. He had already predicted that the probability of it working was low, but when he used up 100 bones in succession, Lee Shin Woo was shocked. He belatedly felt regretful, as he thought that it would be better to just sell them at the secret shop.\n\"But since I’ve already started, I can’t stop.\"\n\"You look really dumb right now.\"\n\"Bone Reinforcement! Bone Reinforcement...!\"\n[Reinforcement has failed.]\n[Reinforcement has failed.]\n[Reinforcement has failed.]\n[The Bone Reinforcement skill has become Lv5! The success rate of weapon reinforcement has increased. When you use Bone Reinforcement on bone weapons, the effectiveness increases.]\n\"Good, Bone Reinforcement!\"\n\"You don’t have any more bones, though.\"\n\"Oh...\"\nLee Shin Woo looked around dejectedly, but Jin was right; there weren’t any bones left. The 200 level 2 bones were completely gone now. The only result was that his Bone Reinforcement leveled up...\n\"It feels like if I just do it once more it would’ve worked!\"\n\"That’s something only gambling addicts say.\"\nEven if he wanted to reinforce his weapons, he didn’t have any more bones, so he couldn’t do anything. Lee Shin Woo wasn’t naturally the type to get attached to failure, so he just lightly sighed, shook off his regrets, and got atop Jin.\nHe had personally received a message confirming that he didn’t have any more business in this city, so he didn’t need to linger and check. It was time for him to leave.\n\"So where to now?\"\n\"Didn’t you originally run around here a lot? Let’s go to one of the places with a lot of level 3-4 monsters.\"\n\"Y-Yeah... fine. Let’s go.\"\nHonestly, Jin was still a bit afraid of level 4 monsters, but when he remembered Lee Shin Woo’s previous slaughter of thousands of monsters, he mustered his courage and began to move. He felt like even if a level 5 elite monster showed up, rather than a level 4 monster, Lee Shin Woo would be able to win somehow.\nWhile he comfortably gave Jin the reins and entrusted him with leading him, Lee Shin Woo opened the chatting channel. It very slightly felt like he was on the phone while driving.\n[Mr. Lee Shin Woo has entered.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Oh, Lee Shin Woo! I heard the news. So you met with Ye Jin Jin?]\n[Lee Shin Woo: It’s a relief that you’re safe, Senior.]\n[Prince Altania: Considering how he’s adapted to this world already... More importantly, what did you get for saving Ye Jin Jin? I just heard that the reward was really amazing, but I don’t know what it is since I’ve never gotten it before.]\n[Erian Ruparte: Lee Shin Woo! Thanks a lot. Because of you, Ye Jin Jin was able to survive!]\nAs soon as Lee Shin Woo accessed the chatting channel, all of his seniors hectically greeted him. It seems like, just like she said she would, Ye Jin Jin had uproariously chatted about him in the channel.\nHonestly, that was an issue that she had talked to Lee Shin Woo about; if he improved his friendship with the other heroes beforehand, they might not be too repulsed by the fact that he was a skeleton when they find out later... which was a plan that came about from their shallow thinking. For reference, they didn’t really talk about Jin.\n[Shino Rendu: Good work, Lee Shin Woo. Whether you acted because of the reward or because you saw the person, we heroes have to stick together.]\n[Yasunori Akira: You’re seriously way too hot-blooded. ...In any case, good job, Lee Shin Woo.]\n[Seira Von Retadane: It was really unexpected that you were both in the same area. But... but it was truly a relief.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: I got a quest to clear out all the undead in the city, so while I was doing that quest... I was just lucky.]\n[Prince Altania: Ah, that...]\nOf course, it was a lie, but he was curious as to how his seniors would respond to this lie. As expected, Prince Altania, who seemed the most loose lipped amongst his seniors, was fooled by his lie.\n[Prince Altania: You just need to do that once. Did you get the Hero’s karma token?]\n[Lee Shin Woo: Yes.]\nThis was it. This was the information that he wanted! Lee Shin Woo pricked his ears and Prince Altania explained.\n[Prince Altania: If you have that, it’s great since your skill growth rate increases, but once you get that one, you don’t really need to get another one. It may not take very long since it was just a small city, but the further you delve into the Empire, the larger the cities become. I’m telling you, you won’t be able to keep them under control later on. The karma tokens normally don’t drop very often so it’s impossible to gather 10 of them from the start.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: So it would seem.]\n[Prince Altania: Moreover, the important thing is that if you start extensively wiping out the undead, the other undead will sniff that out and gather, so you’ll have to continue battling them unceasingly. If something goes wrong, even a hero can die.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: But hey, isn’t that exactly why God chose us as heroes...? I’m talking about purifying the Empire.]\n[Shino Rendu: At the start, I somehow succeeded in cleaning up a small city and gained a Hero’s token. I thought that there might be a chance that I could amplify the effects of the token, so I risked my life to enter a few cities and tried to clear out the undead, but getting one more token doesn’t amplify the effects at all...]\n[Prince Altania: Are you dumb? Tokens of the same kind don’t amplify the effect. Get all 10 of them or stick to one.]\n[Shino Rendu: This asshole... I was a newbie back then too!]\nHe had already gained a lot of good info. Lee Shin Woo took note of all the precious information and opened his mouth again. With a voice that relayed his seriousness and his sense of duty as best he could!\n[Lee Shin Woo: Since you’re saying it’s a hero’s duty, I’ll clear as many of them as I can and then go up.]\nOf course, it was a lie. He had already chosen the Joker’s karma, so he didn’t really need to put in the effort of collecting all 10 of the Hero’s karma tokens! If he ended up cleaning up a city, it wouldn’t be because he was burning with the desire to fulfill his mission as a hero, but because he wanted to collect materials for Bone Reinforcement!\n[Prince Altania: This guy’s like Lloyd... If you do that, it’ll take a long time for you to reach level 5.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: See, that’s what a hero should be like!]\n[Erian Ruparte: ...You’re cool, Lloyd.]\n[Seira Von Retadane: Mr. Lee Shin Woo, you’re doing well. Since we must allow the undead in the Empire to rest in peace...]\n[Ethan Cruz: I’m pleased that there’re more heroes acting like heroes now.]\nAt that moment, Lee Shin Woo felt like time had stopped within the chatting channel. At the very least, when he heard a middle-aged man’s voice cut in, one that he heard for the very first time, he felt speechless! However, Lloyd soon responded to him.\n[Lloyd H.K.: Oh, Senior!]\n[Yasunori Akira: It’s been a long time.]\n[Prince Altania: I’m glad you’re safe, Senior.]\nIf even the Prince addressed him with an honorific, then his position as a senior in the chatting channel must be unwavering. Lee Shin Woo followed their lead for now, and politely greeted him.\n[Lee Shin Woo: I’m a newbie who got here just a little while ago. Please take care of me, Senior.]\n[Ethan Cruz: Ooh, it’s a pleasure. But you have such good manners, so it makes me kind of uncomfortable. Just speak comfortably.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: Haha... I’ll try my best.]\n[Ethan Cruz: Good. I hope we get to see each other for a long time. Ah, by the way, Lloyd. Is Seira doing alright too?]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Yes, Senior. She’s alright.]\n[Seira Von Retadane: ...Please, go ahead.]\n[Ethan Cruz: I have something I’d like you to help me with. The capital’s thorn castle walls...]\nHis seniors began talking about places or geographical features he didn’t know about at this time, and Lee Shin Woo thought he’d obtained all the information he could for now, so he decided to carefully say his farewells and leave. However, before he could, Ethan Cruz called him.\n[Ethan Cruz: Work hard, Lee Shin Woo. You might think about a lot of things as you stand up against the Empire, but... all you need to remember is that all the undead are our, humanity’s enemies.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: ...Yes.]\nNone of his seniors refuted his statement that all undead are enemies of humanity.\nAs he thought, the heroes in the chatting channel didn’t know about the undead who didn’t loathe humanity and had proper reasoning.\nOr they were acting like they didn’t know about them.",

    "content": "<Chapter 11. Lightning Tooth - 1>\n[Lee Shin Woo: Then I’ll get going now. I’ll come back later.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Alright. Don’t die, Lee Shin Woo. Hmm... yeah. Anyway, let’s talk later.]\n[Erian Ruparte: Are you leaving already? Jin Jin will be disappointed.]\n[Prince Altania: Hey, I’m just putting this out there, but don’t go overboard with the romance. If your relationship gets too deep and one of you dies first, the other will go crazy.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: Romance? Hahaha...]\nIt seems that his senior heroes who, after hearing that he’d saved a hero of the opposite sex, thought it was plausible given the situation and had misunderstood, but... so long as Ye Jin Jin didn’t have an extremely peculiar disposition, he didn’t think they had anything to worry about.\nIndeed, if his seniors were to ascertain his true identity, what would they think? Lee Shin Woo couldn’t stop laughing at the thought. However, around the time when he’d quickly left the chatting channel, Jin called to him with some nice timing.\n\"Shin Woo, we’re here.\"\n\"Wow.\"\nIt had only been a few minutes since he started talking to his seniors, yet he realized that the landscape had completely changed in that short time and exclaimed. It had definitely been flatland just a little while ago, but right now, it was the edge of a plateau.\n\"The view’s nice.\"\n\"You think the view’s nice? It’s terrible compared to my homeland’s natural environment... To the point that I feel nauseous.\"\nLee Shin Woo laughed bitterly at Jin’s statement. There wasn’t anything remaining in the underground empire to call ’natural’ anymore, so he wasn’t wrong.\nAs an aftereffect of the curse, all the grass, flowers, and trees decayed, so all this empire really had left was rock, dilapidated buildings, filth, and undead. But when he looked down from up high in a remote location, he admired the view; it looked quite nice.\nIt felt like the moment Charlie Chaplin won 1st place again. When one looks at their life, their battles, or even this dirty and crude underground empire from afar, it actually looks quite nice.\n\"You’ll have to survive in this Empire as well from now on, so try your best.\"\n\"I’m really jealous of that mentality of yours.\"\nThey tried to find the traces of where they had just been. They had left it just a little while ago, and as such, they saw the city they had departed from not very far away; strangely, the surrounding area was completely covered with a black mist, yet only the city was covered in a faint mist. It seems like it was an effect of them clearing out all of the undead.\n\"Hmm...?\"\nAt that moment, Lee Shin Woo discovered something peculiar. He wanted to see what lay beyond the city, but there was a truly huge wall that blocked his vision, so he couldn’t check. Seeing the wall that was god knows how high, he gasped.\nHowever, when he looked thoroughly, he saw a huge hole at the bottom of the wall. It was a passageway that allowed access to the city.\n\"That means... that’s the external passageway that leads to the surface. Does this mean this is the end of the Empire?\"\n\"How do you think they made a wall like that...?\"\n\"It’s the opposite. They dug through the ground here and created the Empire, so they probably weren’t the one who made the wall. Though they were probably the ones who strengthened the wall.\"\nIn a sense, that was even more amazing. They had dug a tremendous depth and width underground to fit the Empire, and fixed it so that the ceiling or the walls wouldn’t collapse... After listening to Lee Shin Woo, Jin seemed to have realized something and sported a vacant expression.\n\"It’s something I couldn’t even imagine happening in my home world.\"\n\"So your world didn’t have magic either, huh.\"\n\"I’m more surprised that you came from a world without magic.\"\nLee Shin Woo chuckled at Jin’s reply and turned around. They couldn’t be overwhelmed by the scale of the Empire forever. Rather than figuring out the magic that they used to create the Empire, it was more important to improve his stats right now.\n\"Then... Huh?\"\nHe looked around, and pondered where he should start his conquest. However, it was troubling that this vast area was a plateau, as there were no undead in sight.\nIndeed, there was nothing to think deeply about; ultimately, undead were beings which had once been alive and had been reborn, so they would appear in environments which could foster life, not a place like this where there were only rocks and boulders.\n\"I don’t sense any undead here.\"\n\"You said you wanted to find monsters. I never said anything about them being undead.\"\n\"You’re right, but... From the start, most of the monsters that can move around in the fields are undead, aren’t they?\"\nLee Shin Woo recollected the unwavering thesis regarding the curse that covered the Empire, and spoke. The curse would kill all living organisms and transform them into the undead. It had already been several dozens of years since the curse had emerged, so there shouldn’t be any other living organisms within the Empire, aside from the heroes.\nThe only exception would be the living organisms living in an environment cut off from the Empire, the dungeons. Even so, the individuals who bore the curse, entered the dungeons, and died would ultimately become undead. Like the Pauls who were in the secret facilities.\n\"Nope. There are some, you know?\"\nHowever, Jin stubbornly persisted, and disagreed. Lee Shin Woo sighed, as he didn’t know where to begin with this newbie hero, but soon, he was faced with the proof that Jin wasn’t wrong.\n[Sensing mana response from living bodies. Beginning movement.]\n[Stopping outside entry. Unless directed otherwise, automatically removing trespassers.]\n[Lv3 Stone Golem]\n[Lv3 Stone Golem]\n\"Oh...\"\n\"See, what did I tell you?\"\nLee Shin Woo, who saw the neglected rocks and boulders within the plateau gradually gather together and form into a huge shape, stared dumbfounded while listening to Jin’s proud boast, and just nodded his head.\n’They weren’t alive from the beginning, so there’s no way they’d be affected by the curse. However, even so...’\nTo think he’d sees slimes and then golems so soon after being dropped into the Empire; after all, they were regulars in fantasy. He just needed to meet goblins, elves, and dragons now, and it felt like he wouldn’t have any regrets. Though it was probably impossible.\nHe raised his weapon whilst thinking of something so idiotic. He wasn’t wielding Bone of Thunder Lasting, which had established itself as his main weapon; instead, he wielded the Melting Bone Double Axe, as he felt a weighty axe would be more effective against huge and crude enemies like golems.\n[Removing trespassers.]\n[Beginning attack in order to figure out the enemies’ magic patterns.]\nThe huge golems, which seemed to be about 3 meters tall, spoke politely and then dashed towards them, stamping on the ground while doing so. They gave off a truly bizarre pressure, but Lee Shin Woo didn’t fall back. He tightly gripped the axe that was almost as tall as he was, exerted his strength, and his (nonexistent) eyes gleamed.\n\"Grasping my magic pattern, huh... I’m doing the same.\"\nSeeing them run was enough for Lee Shin Woo to tell that their agility was low for level 3s. But they were definitely a lot higher than him in terms of strength and health. However...\n\"Shall we?\"\n\"I heard you just say that you’re definitely weaker than them just now.\"\n\"Let’s take down the leftmost one first, so that we don’t get surrounded. Charge!\"\n\"Ah, seriously!\"\nEven while complaining, Jin followed his command and rushed towards the leftmost charging golem. Jin sprinted at such a speed that the golem couldn’t even react!\nLee Shin Woo desperately focused so that he wouldn’t be treated like a package again. He instinctually activated his Combat Sprint and focused all his attention in front. They quickly passed by the surrounding landscape, and in that accelerated time, the golems moved extremely slowly... Then the golem they had chosen as their target soon appeared!\n’I already knew, but he’s really fast! Plus, he’s so precise that it makes me feel goosebumps...!’\nIndeed, Jin’s ability was astounding. He applied his agility, which was incomparable to that of the Stone Golems, and had superb control, getting them close to the golem without ever touching it.\nThough their communication was still poor, if they took into consideration the fact that Jin hadn’t received any special training as a horse, his skill was amazing.\n[Tress...pass...!]\nWas it because he was communicating with the highly agile Jin? It wasn’t enough that his dynamic visual acuity had been enhanced, but he was also starting to hear things at a slower pace as well. It was funny, as the golems sounded like they were bugged, as they kept cutting off.\nThe end came quickly. One breath was divided into ten, and he then divided them into another ten; when he counted six of those, he found his timing! He wasn’t as surprised at Jin’s shocking speed so much as he was able to match and respond to it.\n’Now! Power Slash!’\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo passed by the left golem, he narrowly matched the timing and struck with his axe. As quick and powerful as lightning! While only muttering those words!\nThough it was the first time he’d wielded the axe, the superlative martial arts technique, Bursting Thunder was amazing, and though the strike wasn’t sharp, it allowed him to pack the weight of the axe within the strike.\n[Critical Hit!]\nThe moment his axe struck the golem’s flank, the slowed down passage of time instantaneously returned to normal. An absurd roar spread throughout the plateau.\nThe outcome was truly brutal. The golem wasn’t able to bear the force of his attack and crumbled right on the spot. After breaking the golem into pieces, Lee Shin Woo and Jin couldn’t be at ease, as they were struck by a rebound force that shook their entire bodies; it was to the point that it was momentary difficult for them to stand.\n[You have hunted a Lv3 Stone Golem.] Thɪs chapter is updatᴇd by novelfire(.)net\n\"Oh.\"\nLee Shin Woo hadn’t expected this development, and spoke perplexedly. He thought it would’ve taken at least two or three hits to beat it, but a one touch kill? Moreover, he had moved so fast and had taken care of the enemy so quickly that the other golem hadn’t figured out his location yet.\n\"You... you’re so overpowered.\"\n\"From my point of view, you’re the overpowered one.\"\nThe two heroes looked at each other in amazement. They realized that they made up for what the other lacked, but this was still too ridiculous.\nOf course, Jin’s role in helping Lee Shin Woo take down the Stone Golem, which was rumored to have an especially high defense, was huge.\nIt was obvious logic that the faster they moved, the more powerful the attack would be, and Jin’s speed had changed a normal attack into a killing blow. Though, it required him to adapt to that speed and be able to control it during the moment before striking to optimally use it.\nIf Jin’s part was 60%, then 30% of it was the weapon. The Melting Bone Double Axe was a suitable intermediate weapon to fundamentally gather all his strength into one point and burst it out all at once, and its level was also higher than the Stone Golem, being a level 4 weapon.\nFurthermore, since the weapon had an option that increased his strength by 25, it was the most suitable weapon for destructive power. Besides, it had an option for acid. Even if he didn’t finish his enemy off in one hit, the Acid Poison that comes after would pour out into the area and melt them.\nThe remaining 10% was obviously Bursting Thunder, which allowed him to use the two elements properly and land a hit on his enemy.\nJust by learning the skill, the practitioner is able to properly wield a weapon they’ve never held before, keep their center of gravity whilst gripping the weapon, and deduce the enemy’s weaknesses; if he didn’t have this skill, regardless of how amazing the individual elements were, he wouldn’t have been able to finish off the Stone Golem in one hit.\n[Confirming the destruction of 1 Autonomous Puppet.]\n[Adjusting the assessment of enemy’s strength upwards.]\n[Impossible to respond to enemy’s speed. Initiating long range bombardment mode.]\nWhile Lee Shin Woo briefly spaced out due to the much too unexpected result, the golems recognized the severity of the situation and began to move differently. Lee Shin Woo felt slightly anxious when he heard about their long range bombardment mode, but Jin looked confident as ever.\n\"Those are slow too. Don’t worry.\"\n\"Right, you said you came here before.\"\nIf that’s the case, then he had the time to collect the loot. Lee Shin Woo bent his body and collected the loot from the floor. He was really looking forward to the appearance of a ’pet that collects the loot for you’ that always appears in games, but it would never happen.\n[You have acquired 3,700 Perium.]\n[You have acquired an Autonomous Defensive Type Core. The core is changing. You have acquired an Autonomous Defensive Type Bone Core.]\n\"A core, huh...\"\n\"Is this another material for Bone Reinforcement by any chance?\"\n\"Of course it is. Plus, I don’t even need to burn them one by one, so it’s better than the slimes.\"\n\"Burn? Slimes?\"\nHe had felt slightly anxious when he’d stood atop the plateau and seen the golems, but after picking up a core, he thought differently. He didn’t have time to waste when his growth was right before him!\n[Firing...]\n\"Heup!\"\nLee Shin Woo counted the number of golems that had revealed themselves in the entire area, and the moment he raised his axe for the second time, Jin, who he had communicated with, kicked off the floor without even needing a signal.\nBefore the golems could even fire their prepared bombardment, Lee Shin Woo and Jin had already closed the distance. Then, Lee Shin Woo swung his axe with all his strength.\n[Critical Hit!]",

    "content": "<Chapter 11. Lightning Tooth - 2>\nThe way the golems went about with their bombardment made him think back to the Ratman launching its nails. By human standards, they were forcefully discharging the rocks attached to their arms and using the surrounding rocks to replenish their losses.\n\"Seems like if you take a wrong step here, it’ll be the end for you.\"\nLee Shin Woo muttered, as he dodged the raining rock shells and drove his axe into a golem’s body. If he had come here by himself, he wouldn’t die, but he would’ve had to put in a lot of effort to clear out all of them.\nBut that ’end’ had now become an impossible proposition. Compared to Jin’s level, no, even compared to his own level, whilst riding on Jin’s back the golem’s bombardment was incredibly slow. Even if they shot the rocks point blank, they would be able to dodge them quite easily.\n\"So it seems like if there’s a large difference between agility, then ranged attacks almost become completely ineffectual...\"\n[Ceasing... operation...]\nWhile he was fighting against the golems, he suddenly realized how important agility was. The Acid Ghoul was able to intercept his shot without much difficulty because of its agility as well.\nSo long as it doesn’t swerve along the way, and one can read the trajectory of the shot, one could avoid it without much difficulty; when he considered that the one dodging the projectile had more of an advantage than the one doing the shooting, if one wanted to kill someone with a long range attack, then he concluded that they would have to be much faster than their opponent.\nFast enough that they can’t read the trajectory of the shot, and fast enough that they can’t grasp the timing of the shot.\n\"If we were to say something like this on our home worlds, we would’ve been subject to ridicule.\"\n\"Is that something you should be saying? I’m the one dodging all of the shells coming from everywhere!\"\nThe first condition for surviving in this world was to accept that they had become a member of this world, and their preexisting common sense was invalid and couldn’t be applied to this world. Based on that criteria, the two of them had passed those conditions with flying colors.\n\"Ah, there aren’t any more.\" Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on novèlfire.net\nHad they crushed all of the golems? Once he’d taken care of the golems that had first responded to him and looked up, there weren’t any more rocks in the entire area. Once broken, they were neither golems nor boulders anymore, and it seemed only natural that only the considerably large boulders were golems.\n\"What should we do now? Should we go across from there?\"\n\"The region that these guys are in charge of seems to be strictly divided.\"\nIf Lee Shin Woo walked for around a minute, he could reach an area with normal rock formations. But if he stepped one foot in, those rocks would immediately emerge as golems.\nEven now, that area wasn’t very far off. It certainly felt strange, the golems seemingly being measured and divided, as only the golems of a fixed area had responded to them. It felt like someone had decided that ’you guys are in charge from here up to here.’\n\"For starters, are these guys really formed naturally?\"\n\"That’s what we have to figure out now.\"\nEven with the shells flying towards him unceasingly, he could still fight, but the same couldn’t be said about the loot; he had to leave them behind. He lead Jin around the whole area, and collected the sprawled cores and Perium off the floor.\n[You have acquired 3,200 Perium.]\n[You have acquired a Autonomous Defensive Type Bone Core.]\n\"Though they’re level 3, they don’t leave much Perium behind unless they’re elites.\"\n\"Where do you even use that?\"\n\"Well, I completely understand where you’re coming from since you’ve never gone to the secret shop before.\"\nHe’d acquired 3,000 Perium from the golem, but it was only a third of what he’d gotten from the similarly leveled elite Great Slime. Of course, it was difficult to find even one Great Slime, but the Stone Golems were comparatively easy to find, as they were spread across the plateau area, so they made up for their quality with quantity.\nAfter he’d raked in all of the Perium from the entire area, he checked how much total Perium he’d collected.\n[Total Perium - 445,870]\n\"Hoo.\"\nWas this what it feels like to be amazed at how much has changed in such a short period of time? It felt like just a few days ago he had unhesitatingly told Pleine his story in exchange for a 20,000 Perium discount, but now, he had already amassed 445,870 Perium. Of course, there were a few special circumstances that helped in that.\n\"Shin Woo, there’s something over here.\"\n\"Ah.\"\n[Lv2 Stone Gloves]\nIt looked like it was armor. The gloves looked like they were made of stupidly tough rock, and he wondered whether this would actually be effective in fending off his opponent’s attacks; but on the contrary, he had his suspicions that these would actually cause more harm to his hands. At the very least, Lee Shin Woo didn’t really want to equip them.\n[You have acquired Lv2 Stone Gloves. Through Bone Reinforcement, the item is changing. Your compatibility with the item is high, causing a special change.]\nHowever, the moment Lee Shin Woo touched the gloves, something strange happened. It was a message he had never seen before, and what’s worse, it was a message he hadn’t even seen when his Melting Bone Double Axe had risen in level!\n[You have acquired Lv3 Fossil Gloves (+5).]\n\"...\"\nBut when he saw the outcome of that change, his (nonexistent) eyes naturally narrowed. Rocks and bone had come together, and had become a fossil; he wanted to tackle the Bone Reinforcement ability itself.\n\"But fossils aren’t technically bones...\"\n\"Why do you need scientific knowledge all of a sudden?\"\n\"Nah, it’s fine. It’s good for me, anyway.\"\nEven if teeth or nails were regarded as bones, he just decided to let it go. Lee Shin Woo decided not to nitpick on each and every aspect of his ability. In any case, not only had his item leveled up, it had also been reinforced to +5, so he was satisfied.\n...Though he still didn’t have any intention of equipping them.\n\"Good, then there’s only one other option.\"\n\"You’re doing it again?\"\nLee Shin Woo didn’t answer Jin’s question, and quietly raised the Fossil Gloves (+5). In his other hand, he held not his axe, but his sword, the Bone of Thunder Lasting (+8).\nIt wasn’t an item he would equip, so he didn’t consider it to be a stupid gamble. While trying his very best to ignore the other option of using the equipment to reinforce his own bones...!\nSomething happened the moment Lee Shin Woo was about to use his Bone Reinforcement. One of the bone cores he still hadn’t stored into his inventory seemed to shine brightly, and a message appeared in front of him.\n[If you consume a bone core and then attempt reinforcement, the success rate increases. If you use the bone core as a material for an equipment’s reinforcement, it will increase even further. It is possible to use several at once in the reinforcement.]\n\"Huh...!?\"\nWhen he thought about it, he remembered reading that normally monsters’ cores are used to produce weapons, or manufacture medicine. However, it turned out that the core itself had the power to reinforce equipment. Perhaps the equipment reinforcement permit also functioned by using the power of a core?\nJust a little while ago, he felt like he had wanted to ’try it out’, but now that he’d read that message, he trusted that the success rate would increase significantly by using the cores, though he had no basis for that. Lee Shin Woo put aside the Fossil Gloves for now, grabbed a bone core in one hand, and used Bone Reinforcement!\n[Bone Reinforcement has succeeded.]\n[Bone of Thunder Lasting +9]\n[Lv3]\n[Durability: 1,120/1,120]\n[Attack Power: 300 - 400]\n[Options: Strength +21, Agility +21, Power of Bursting Thunder skill +19%]\n\"Oh, Ooooh...!\"\nIt had really succeeded with just one try! Lee Shin Woo was moved and embraced his weapon. However, Jin spoke calmly by his side.\n\"Shin Woo, on the ground.\"\n\"Huh? ...No...\"\nIt was at that time that Lee Shin Woo finally realized that every single one of the bone cores he’d gathered in one place had disappeared.\nThere were a few inside his inventory that were still safe, but the rest disappeared. There were more than ten of them there, and the moment he used his reinforcement, they had resonated without his consent!\n\"...\"\nHe gained new knowledge again. If he used bone cores to reinforce his equipment, the cores would resonate as they pleased! It had increased...!\nFortunately, the price came cheap. It was such a relief that he hadn’t attempted to reinforce his equipment while he had 100 bone cores laid out!\nEspecially since, if he hadn’t gathered the bone cores and attempted the reinforcement, he didn’t know how long he’d be stuck without being able to succeed. So this was fine. It was fine.\n\"Shin Woo, are you crying?\"\n\"I’m not crying.\"\nHe replied bitterly, removed the final remaining level 3 equipment reinforcement permit from his inventory, and raised it.\nEven if he inspected his Bone of Thunder Lasting one more time, it was still at +9. He grit his teeth and used the reinforcement permit. Then, radiant light spewed out of the weapon and a tremendous amount of mana surged. This dense mana seemed to be able to change the very material of the weapon, and heated up the air.\n[The Lv3 Bone of Thunder Lasting has evolved into the Lv4 Lightning Tooth!]\n[Lightning Tooth]\n[Lv4]\n[Durability: 1,500/1,500]\n[Attack Power : 450 - 480]\n[Element: Lightning Lv4]\n[Options: Strength +25, Agility +25, Power of Bursting Thunder +20%]\n\"This is...\"\nSeeing his completely transformed weapon, Lee Shin Woo interjected. It was a completely different weapon from the level 4 weapon, Thunder Lasting, that he’d acquired from the zombie turned hero.\nBy coming into his possession, it had deteriorated into bone in the past, but at least, the current Lightning Tooth didn’t seem inferior to the Thunder Lasting; there was no mistake that it was actually much stronger than Thunder Lasting. That’s because two tremendous powers had collided, ultimately harmonizing, and the outcome was its evolution.\n\"Wow, even if you compare it to the axe, the energy coming off that thing’s no joke.\"\n\"You have considerable talent in mana as well, huh. You’re right. They’re both level 4, but this weapon’s exceptional and is incomparable to the axe. It’s not an exaggeration to say that this bone contains God’s power.\"\n\"At any rate, it’s a bone, huh...\"\nThe blade consisted of a bone gleaming in blue light, and was longer, and sharper than before; the fact that there was a slight power of lightning within had surfaced, and began to spark.\nHe was excited thinking about what would happen if he held this weapon and used an intermediate level of Bursting Thunder. Thus, Lee Shin Woo was spurred on to train his Bursting Thunder even more diligently than before.\n’Acid and lightning. Flames... Then, this makes me want to use the other elements a bit.’\nIf he only had one element out of three, that would be plenty to represent him as a hero, yet he was still greedy for more even though he had three. He still hadn’t realized at this point that he possessed abilities that would more than shock his senior heroes.\n- Gugugugugu\nHowever, when Lee Shin Woo was fascinated with the power of his weapon, the once silent plateau area suddenly vibrated. What’s worse, the vibrations gradually became worse!\nDid the golems wake up? If that’s not it, was it a natural earthquake? Both of those were wrong. The golems were still quietly staying in their places, and it obviously wasn’t an earthquake. Then, what was it?\n[Goooooooooooh!]\n\"Mm, as I thought.\"\nLee Shin Woo heard the faint cry from afar, nodded his head, and spoke, as if he had expertly anticipated it. Around now, it started to feel like a traditional event.\nHe quickly put the Fossil Gloves and his sword into his inventory, and cleanly used up the two remaining bone cores to reinforce his bones. His health increased by 1, so now he only needed 1 more stat point before he leveled up.\n\"What the hell is this? It’s like there’s a huge monster on the move, but I can’t tell if it’s actually coming!\"\n\"Calm down, Jin. Since I already know what it is.\"\n\"You can’t even see it yet, so how do you know?\"\n\"I just know.\"\nAround the time Lee Shin Woo calmly answered Jin, who was even more flustered than when he had fought the Acid Ghoul, the enemy revealed itself beyond the horizon.\nIt was rushing towards them, yet the golems didn’t stand up and attack it. It seems like it wasn’t considered a trespasser.\n\"What kind of monster could it be!? Don’t we need to run away!?\"\n\"There’s no way to completely get away from it once it’s picked its ’target’. ...Though it’s level may be different, I have experience fighting them, so wait for now.\"\nOf course, he didn’t really have any memories of fighting it from the front. This time too, he didn’t plan on fighting it face-to-face. There were a multitude of ways to kill an enemy besides slicing off their head.\nAround that time, Jin was able to confirm the identity of their enemy with his own two eyes, and spoke in vivid horror.\n\"Lv5...!? Can we win!?\"\n\"...Even if we can’t, we have to fight. That’s what the Empire’s all about.\"\n\"That’s...\"\nLee Shin Woo comforted the confused Jin and checked his opponent. It had less than a couple hundred meters to go, and the appearance of a monster filled his eyes, one which he was familiar with to the point that it felt slightly tedious.\n[Lv5 Treasure Eater]\nSteve, who he hadn’t seen in a long time, was here.",

    "content": "<Chapter 11. Lightning Tooth - 3>\nThe level 5 Treasure Eater roamed the underground in search for higher leveled treasures.\nHowever, by leveling up, the Treasure Eater’s eyesight had drastically improved, and there weren’t many items that it recognized as treasures. Thunder Lasting, which had dropped to level 3, had returned to level 4 and had actually become more powerful, transforming into the Lightning Tooth, thereby becoming enticing enough prey to draw the Treasure Eater.\n[Lv5 Treasure Eater]\nIn the end, it wasn’t a level 4 Treasure Eater that had arrived, but a level 5 one! He knew there’d be a day that he’d meet one again, but he didn’t think he’d have to fight against one that was two levels higher than him...\nDespite feeling slightly concerned, Lee Shin Woo greeted the Treasure Eater with unmistakable excitement and joy.\n\"Hey, Steve...?\"\n[Guwoooooooooooh!]\n[The Treasure Eater uses Shriek of the Dead. Those exposed to this shriek momentarily fall into a frenzied and fearful state.]\n[Invisible Heart nullifies the effects of Shriek of the Dead.]\nHowever, the Treasure Eater responded to his lively greeting with Shriek of the Dead. ’What shitty manners,’ he thought, while Jin spoke from beside him whilst persistently gritting his teeth.\n\"You learned that yelling skill from the same species as that weird bug, right?\n\"Yep. How’re you holding up?\"\n\"Somehow...\"\nLee Shin Woo naturally wasn’t affected by the scream, and Jin wasn’t either. It wasn’t because they were undead, or because Jin was a horse, but because of his Horseback Riding skill; it was because they were connected, albeit superficially.\nIn other words, the status ailment that Jin should’ve received was shared with Lee Shin Woo, and in the process, Invisible Heart had completely taken care of it.\n[Gooooooooooh!]\nSince its shriek was ineffective, the Treasure Eater seemed pissed and charged. The golems that were spread across the highlands rolled to either side, making a path for the Treasure Eater so that they wouldn’t get in the way. It was as if they were saying ’It’s not our problem. Take care of it amongst yourselves, whether you have to fight or kill each other.’!\nJin spoke slightly urgently towards Lee Shin Woo, who was nodding, feeling as though the golems’ IQ was higher than he had thought.\n\"How the hell are you going to fight against that idiot?\"\n\"Hmm... I’ll think about it after getting some more info.\"\nThe level 2 Treasure Eater didn’t have any special abilities aside from Shriek of the Dead or Roar of Healing.\nHowever, the level 3 Treasure Eater possessed an outrageous ability, the Flames of Resentment, instead of the Roar of Healing (it might’ve had it, but at the very least, he didn’t see it use it against him). So he didn’t have any ways of knowing right now of what abilities, besides Shriek of the Dead, the level 5 Treasure Eater possessed.\nIt may have all of those abilities, or it may have something even more outrageous. Since this Treasure Eater was his first encounter with a level 5 monster, and it was also an elite, he couldn’t know for sure.\n\"Could you maintain this distance for me? Can you do it?\"\n\"Yeah, that’s not a problem.\"\nTreasure Eaters tended to have high magic and health. In other words, compared to its size, its speed and strength aren’t very impressive. Of course, it was level 5, so its stats should be amplified accordingly, but to Jin, who had overwhelming speed even at level 4, there was no way it would be able to catch them.\nEven while Lee Shin Woo rode on his back, that fact didn’t really change. Jin strode across the rugged highlands as if it were flatlands and leisurely widened the distance between them and the Treasure Eater!\n[Guooooooooooh!]\n\"Yes, yes. I’m over here. Catapult!\"\n[Kuhaaaaaahk!]\nFor starters, he needed to figure out whether his Catapult would be effective against it or not. Lee Shin Woo moved as quickly as possible and shot his index finger, but the Treasure Eater instantly emitted a horrific shriek and the flying shot exploded in midair.\nHe had expected it to evade it or block it, but he didn’t think a method like that would exist! Seeing that, Jin spoke in disgust even whilst running.\n\"Don’t learn that skill. If you don’t want to burst my eardrums.\"\n\"You don’t have any eardrums to burst... Never mind, sorry. My bad. Please don’t drop me.\"\nLee Shin Woo desperately regained his balance atop the excessively shaking Jin and pointed both hands at the Treasure Eater this time. Of course, this attempt didn’t come from a complacent idea like ’one didn’t work, so let’s fire several simultaneously, and hopefully, one will eventually hit the mark.’\n\"Firing!\"\nAll 10 of his fingers, from his thumbs to his little fingers, were coated in flames and fired. However, they lost their power midflight, as if he had shot them improperly, and fell to the ground! Steve trampled those bones as if it were mocking him, and attempted to keep charging but...\n\"Self-Destruct!\"\n[Kuwoooooohk!]\n[Critical Hit!]\nAt that instant, Lee Shin Woo yelled vigorously, and all of the 10 bone pieces exploded, hitting its abdominal area hard, causing it to roll onto the floor while spurting blood! Though he was on the cusp of becoming level 4, a level 5 elite monster had been successfully struck by a level 3 hero’s blow!\n\"Hoo, it worked...\"\n\"You should’ve told me ahead of time.\" Read complete versıon only at Novᴇl_Fire(.)net\nLee Shin Woo, who had already fought Treasure Eaters a few times before, knew that the skin covering its head and its back were tough, and knew that only its stomach area was weak. He had shot his first Catapult in order to ascertain its abilities.\nHe acted as though he didn’t have a suitable way to deal with it, lulled it into a false sense of security, and then, sprung the trap at the most opportune time; weren’t these the basics for a Duelist? Though he wasn’t a Duelist!\n\"Then... it’s time. Jin, run!\"\n\"Run!? You said we couldn’t run back then!?\"\n\"Temporarily! We need to run in order to get the last piece in place!\"\nJin, who was surprised that Lee Shin Woo suddenly told him to run when it’d finally seemed like they’d have a shot at beating it, asked back, but Lee Shin Woo didn’t explain at length.\nThough they had an opening where they could get a huge hit in, a difference of 2 levels was huge. A similar attack likely wouldn’t be effective twice, and if that’s the case, they would lose if they kept going at it like this, as the Treasure Eater was unfathomably tough.\nWhat could they do then? The answer was the cheat skill he had; he needed to activate his Avenger skill.\nHim attacking the Treasure Eater was to satisfy the activation conditions of his skill. Whether he inflicted damage on it, or he took damage, they both count as being in battle!\n\"Tch...I got it!\"\nHe knew that Lee Shin Woo’s decision making in combat situations was much more accurate than his own, so Jin turned his body around and dashed away. Jin was running at his max speed, and Lee Shin Woo barely endured so that he wouldn’t fall off!\nAs a result, they arrived within the flatlands he’d remembered seeing before in less than two minutes. The message Lee Shin Woo had been waiting for also appeared at an opportune time.\n[You have acquired a target for the Beginner Avenger skill. When you meet the target again, all abilities increase by 36%.]\n\"Nice, now I should be overflowing with strength...!\"\nThe Avenger skill was key in allowing him to fight enemies that were a higher level than him.\nHe felt anxious because the target this time around was a monster two levels higher, but he had Jin right now. If he supported him with his high agility, he may even be able to defeat the Treasure Eater more easily than the King Slime.\nHowever, at that moment, Jin spoke thoughtlessly.\n\"Is that also a skill it normally has?\"\n\"Huh? ...What the hell?\"\nUpon hearing him speak, Lee Shin Woo turned his head and his (nonexistent) eyes widened. From afar, the Treasure Eater was chasing after them with frightening vigor, and dozens of blackish whips poured out of its body and were violently flying towards them.\nNo, they weren’t whips. It was blood! It was controlling whips that originated from its blood!\n\"Hold on tight!\"\n\"Ugh!?\"\nThe whips were ridiculously fast compared to its main body. Immediately after seeing them move, Jin began to quickly gallop away but they would soon reach them any minute now.\n[You have found the target of your revenge. When you fight it, all abilities increase by 36%. Flames of Revenge receive an additional 36% increase.]\n\"Nice... Take this!\"\nLee Shin Woo clicked his tongue and shot out his Flames of Revenge, which were amplified by his Avenger skill; though the whips, originating from its blood, met with the flames, they didn’t evaporate easily. Especially because several more whips were crazily flying towards them!\n\"Jin, run! Run for now!\"\n\"Damn it. If it weren’t for those weird tentacles, we could’ve completely slipped away...!\"\n[Guwooooooh!]\nWas it considerably angry that it had been harmed by Lee Shin Woo, who was a lower level than it? The Treasure Eater, which had recovered from the pain and stood upright, divided the blood spilling from its stomach into dozens of whips and controlled them, simultaneously moving its main body and charging.\nLee Shin Woo grit his teeth. There were way too many of them to take down one by one with his flames! Yet, using Acid Poison would consume too much mana, and its characteristic of fundamentally focusing all of the poison at one point wouldn’t be suitable at this very moment.\n\"Shin Woo!\"\n\"Guh!\"\nLee Shin Woo couldn’t perceive the pattern of its attacks, and one of the whips latched onto Lee Shin Woo’s arm the moment he panicked, stubbornly coiling and tightening around it. He was then afflicted with a horrific pain.\nIt was as if the whip contained the level 5 Treasure Eater’s physical strength, and just from its exterior, seemed to possess an unimaginable toughness. The whips were overwhelmingly faster than its main body, and it had fully transferred its physical strength into them; this was the first time he’d experienced such a cheap ability!\n\"Tch... Catapult!\"\n\"You!?\"\nLee Shin Woo had a hunch that even if he tried to resist, he would just end up getting dragged by the whip, so instead, he gave in and shot off his grabbed arm! For just a moment, it felt like the tremendous pain would’ve dragged his consciousness under, but Lee Shin Woo resisted with only his tenacious spirit.\n[Kueeehk!]\nEven Steve, who possessed that bizzare ability, hadn’t expected that Lee Shin Woo would get out like this! His launched arm, as well as the whip flew dizzily through the air, and the whips flying towards them ended up becoming tangled in one spot.\nLee Shin Woo didn’t miss that golden opportunity. He treated those whips as travelling companions and unhesitatingly blew up his bone arm! As if it were proving that it had blown off the Acid Ghoul’s head entirely on the spot, it exploded magnificently. It completely burned down the blood whips in the entire area.\n[Kyaaaaaaaahk!]\n\"Does it hurt? It really hurts for me too! Anyway, you’re always using such crazy attacks...!\"\nThe moment the whips were swallowed up by the explosion and dissipated, the Treasure Eater also seemed to take quite a bit of damage, as it momentarily paused in its pursuit and agonizingly yelled. It was a great advantage to learn that damage to its blood whips would cause its main body harm.\n\"Are you alright!?\"\n\"I’ll be fine if I apply the bone powder. Just keep an eye out for those whips and move carefully.\"\nJin was astonished at Lee Shin Woo sacrificing his arm without any hesitation, but Lee Shin Woo didn’t think much of it, and used the bone powder from within his inventory, activating Bone Reinforcement around his shoulder area. Though he used a sizeable lump of bone powder, he was able to regenerate without even using a drop of mana.\n\"You’re really...\"\n\"Jin, it’s moving again!\"\n\"Ugh.\"\nIt wasn’t possible for it to attack with its main body anymore. The Treasure Eater simultaneously stretched out dozens of new whips and left half of them close to its body, while the other half shoot out and attacked them.\nEven so, it was a relief that he’d spread his Flames of Revenge on its main body when he’d burst its stomach.\n’I’ve lost my arm once already, yet it’s only spilled blood once. Moreover, the number of whips popping out are almost endless. So this is a level 5 elite monster, huh...’\nIf he could, he would’ve ran until the Flames of Revenge claimed its life, but no matter how calmly he thought about it, he couldn’t afford to keep running away from it until then.\nThen... Lee Shin Woo thought he had no other choice... in the end, he gritted his teeth and raised his head.\nIt was time to battle it face-to-face.",

    "content": "<Chapter 12. Joker Apprentice - 1>\nLee Shin Woo’s spirit changed, and Jin, who he was communicating with, was the first to react to it.\n\"You’re going to face it head on? You’ve been attacking using Catapult all this time; can’t you just keep doing that!?\"\n\"No matter how much stronger I’ve gotten from the Avenger skill, there’s no guarantee I’ll be able to penetrate it’s skin. It’s even more impossible due to the blood whips that ensued from the direct hit to the stomach.\"\nThe blood whips were quick, powerful, and contained deep magic within, so they were even strong against magic attacks, but against Self-Destruct, which was both powerful and explosive, they seemed to have futilely disappeared, so he could determine that they had low durability.\nIf there was one thing he trusted in, it was this: that he could take it down right now, while his abilities were strengthened by the Avenger skill!\n\"There’s no other way. I’ll make sure you can get away before you die, so go!\"\nLee Shin Woo firmly resolved himself, pulled out his sword, and gripped it. A sword would be more suitable to deal with those whips that nimbly flew towards them than a heavy axe. He wasn’t yet confident in his martial arts proficiency, but he had no choice right now.\n\"Everything doesn’t work out if I’m the only one who survives, though... Ah, whatever!\"\nIn the end, Jin gave up and instantly changed directions, dashing towards the Treasure Eater. As if it were awaiting them, it sharpened its blood whips akin to skewers, and the whips flew everywhere!\nCompared to last time, they were much weaker, but in exchange, there were at least twice the amount pressuring him from all sides. With Jin’s astonishingly quick reactions, they were able to avoid around half of them, but Lee Shin Woo had to deal with the rest.\n’If I fail, I just have to get Jin to run away, and die alone. From there, through Invisible Heart, I’ll become level 4, and can then kill it. ...However, if it’s at all possible, I’d rather not die...!’\nLee Shin Woo glared and gritted his teeth. Then, he activated Combat Sprint, and drew at his connection with Jin.\nHe desperately needed Jin’s speed right now. If he could apply even just a little bit of that speed...!\n[Guwooooooooooh!]\nNo matter how superb Combat Sprint is or how much he communes with the highly agile Jin, it was impossible for him to ascertain the trajectory of each and every one of the attacks a level 5 elite monster launched.\nBecause of that, Lee Shin Woo decided to think in reverse. He didn’t track the attack’s starting point, nor its trajectory. Instead, he grasped its final destination and would block it from there!\n’First, I’ll take care of the ones closest to me in order... Now!’\nHis decision was truly outstanding. His senses, which he sharpened as much he could, caught the whip flying towards his head; at the same time, he instinctually thrust his sword, successfully cutting through the middle of the whip! The severed whip returned to being a normal stream of blood, and futilely moistened the ground.\n[Kyaaaahk!]\nThe Treasure Eater yelled, but that was just the beginning. Immediately after severing one whip, his sword turned directions, as if it were alive, and cut through another whip! And faster, even faster than before!\n’I can do it... I can! Now!’\nHe perfectly detected everything within the narrow radius, with him at its center, and struck down anything that trespassed within. Lee Shin Woo wasn’t well aware of it yet, but this was often called the ’Defense Zone’ by the Empire’s knights.\nIt was a skill that could only be developed by balancing one’s physical senses and mana senses; it wasn’t a standard skill, but it was certainly something a defender must learn. The level of a knight will differ based on the width of this ’Defense Zone’, so it wasn’t necessary to say just how important it was.\n[The Low Rank Combat Sprint skill has become Lv9. Agility has increased by 3.]\n[The Low Rank Bursting Thunder skill has become Lv8. Strength, and magic increase by 1.]\n[The Low Rank Horseback Riding skill has become Lv5. Agility has increased by 3.]\n[The Low Rank Mana Bone skill has become Lv7. Magic has increased by 5.]\n[It is possible to level up to level 4. Would you like to receive the karma that has been prepared for you alone? It is also possible to very briefly put it off.]\nWhile in the middle of that his skills rose, and he acquired stats, allowing for the level up he had so ardently wished for. However, it was truly ironic that he didn’t read the messages as he was so focused on cutting down the whips and advancing closer to the Treasure Eater.\n[You have deferred receiving the karma you must receive in favor of your immediate revenge. That is a true Avenger’s instinct. The Beginner Avenger skill has become Lv10, evolving into the low rank level. All stats have increased by 2. When you fight against the target of your revenge, all abilities increase by 40%, and when you succeed in your vengeance, your stats increase.]\n’Good... My detection range is gradually widening!’\nHis Avenger skill grew, and the increased abilities sharpened his senses and quickened his attacks! He didn’t let go of this momentum, drew all his strength, and moved his body. Follow current novels on novel~fire~net\n[Kuwaaaaaaaaaaaahk!]\nThe blood whips, which seemed like they would immediately pierce through his head, were cut apart like straws, spreading blood everywhere. His physical senses, his mana senses, as well as Jin’s connection harmonized together, causing him to fall into a trance.\nEven Jin, who had a connection with him, had fallen into a trance as well!\n’Huh!?’\nHow long had he been instinctually swinging his sword around and running around with Jin? There were no longer any whips that stretched out from the Treasure Eater.\nBy the time he noticed, he had already arrived right in front of the Treasure Eater. He had successfully severed all those whips! Though there were holes pierced through his armor in various areas, he had survived.\n\"Now, let’s start the second round Ste...\"\n[Kureureuaaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\nHowever, the moment Lee Shin Woo was going to make a bold declaration, Steve roared and spat out a clot of blood, one so large that it looked like it could trap both Lee Shin Woo and Jin.\nIt had seen how easily Lee Shin Woo had taken care of the whips, and purposefully acted as if it were panicking, drawing him into a close distance!\n\"Ugh!\"\n\"Heut...!\"\nAt that timing, many things happened; firstly, Lee Shin Woo aimed at the Treasure Eater’s gaping maw, due to it spitting out a blood clot, and launched his arm inside.\n[The Low Rank Catapult skill has become Lv5. Agility has increased by 2.]\nThe moment he launched his arm, the force pushed both Jin and Lee Shin Woo back; Jin actively utilized the ensuing recoil force and moved his body backwards. It was a perfect evasive maneuver.\nHowever, it seemed as though the Treasure Eater had expected them to run away, as the spat out blood clot followed them with an absurdly quick speed! It swelled brutally, as if it were part of the main body!\n\"Heup...!\"\nHe needed to use all the methods available to him now. He gritted his teeth, stretched his remaining arm forward, and activated his Acid Poison Spray skill. Like the Acid Ghoul had, he focused his mana and spewed the Acid Poison in a straight line!\nIt was his sole skill that had reached the intermediate level, and befitting of a high rank skill, the Acid Poison spewed out like a laser; it struck the blood clot, emitted a hair-raising noise, and melted the blood clot away!\n\"Self-Destruct!\"\n[Kuaaaaaaaaaaahk!]\nFrom there, he self-destructed the catapulted arm, burrowed at the roof of Steve’s mouth! He was able to properly damage the gaping Treasure Eater, following its discharge of the clot of blood!\n[Critical Hit!]\n[The Low Rank Self-Destruct skill has become Lv4. Strength and Magic have increased by 1. The force of the explosion increases.]\nThough their reactions were perfect, their situation wasn’t. After acquiring the Mana Bone skill, he had never been lacking in mana; but because he had repeatedly used his skills and also used the Acid Poison Spray, which consumed a large quantity of mana, as well as a large-scale Self-Destruct, he was out of mana.\n\"...With this, is it over?\"\n\"No.\"\nJin muttered, and Lee Shin Woo briefly denied him. Immediately after, beyond the poison mist formed by the Acid Poison Spray, dozens of very slender blood whips rushed towards them. At a remarkably faster speed than before!\nJin briefly faltered in fear at its increased brutality, and realizing this, Lee Shin Woo quickly disembarked from his back.\n\"Get back. You only have two lives.\"\n\"...No wait, you can’t win if you’re not with me!\"\n\"That’s...\"\nBecause they were connected, he knew it as well. The reason Lee Shin Woo was able to react to its whips was because of Jin!\n\"Hey, they’re coming!\"\n\"Eek!\"\nLee Shin Woo attempted to urgently push him away, but before he could do so, Jin bit his arm and skillfully pulled him onto his back. Immediately after, the blood whips flew towards them! Lee Shin Woo realized that there was no time for an argument between the two and he hastily swung his sword.\n\"Ugh...!\"\n\"They’re coming again! I can take care of the front, so you go left!\"\nTheir timing was a bit off, so his left shoulder was shattered, but he severed the whip before any further damage could occur. Of course, he didn’t have any time to relax! He had to swing his sword even faster to cover both him and Jin!\n[Kuaoooooooooh!]\n\"Ugh...!\"\nThe connection between the two broke, and they felt their loosened senses fiercely tighten around them again, afflicting them with terrible migraines, but it was nothing compared to the pain of losing an arm.\nHe had to swing his sword more quickly, and more precisely in order to better cover Jin, who had trusted in him and was risking his life for him!\n[The Low Rank Horseback Riding skill has become Lv6. Agility has increased by 2. Your connection with your riding companion increases.]\nThe moment their wills were in agreement, a connection stronger than before was formed, matching their senses. Lee Shin Woo’s reflexes had surpassed his limits!\n’Even faster...’\nOne, two, three... six, nine. Eleven. Fifteen. Twenty one! His armor was pierced faster than before, but Lee Shin Woo’s sword strikes were gradually catching up to the whips’ speed.\nHe was completely out of mana, but because he was, his mana senses became even clearer. He had become extremely sensitive to the surrounding mana, and before the Treasure Eater’s whips moved, he perceived the movement of the mana within the whips, and was able to move his sword beforehand!\n[The Low Rank Combat Sprint skill has become Lv10 and is evolving. You have acquired a horse that will run for you and have given up on you yourself running fast. Instead, you have only trained the techniques which expand your own senses, and have exceptionally evolved them. You have acquired the passive skill, Intermediate Combat Sense Lv1. Within a limited time and space, you can effectively move and face your enemy.]\nHe had no way of knowing how the skill had changed right at this very moment. But he did realize that he had passed over a wall, and advanced to the next level.\nEven if his agility, strength, health, or magic were lacking, it was fine. Perceiving stimuli, moving beforehand, and blocking completed the Defense Zone!\n[Kuwaaaaaaaaahk!]\nThe Treasure Eater emitted a final roar, but nothing happened. So long as its technique of controlling blood was a skill, it used mana. Because it had excessively utilized its skill, its mana was empty.\nThe blood whips began to lose their strength and fell to the ground, and the Treasure Eater’s wound filled body was revealed. Its injury from the last Self-Destruct was especially large. It had lost half of its head, from the bottom up. Its skin had peeled and the ominous rotten flesh underneath was exposed.\n[Kuu... Kuhaahk...!]\nIf it wasn’t for the fact that he was a skeleton, his remaining arm, which he had swung much too fast, probably would’ve gone numb, and it would’ve been difficult to swing.\nHowever, he was fine now. He was confident that he could swing his sword for twelve more hours. Though he didn’t really want to feel thankful for many reasons, he still felt thankful that he was a skeleton right now.\n\"Hoo...\"\nHe exerted more strength into the hand gripping his sword. His will was relayed to Jin, and Jin stepped forward.\nThe Treasure Eater, which had lost all of its methods of attacking, mustered its remaining strength and charged, but there was no way Jin wouldn’t be able to dodge it, when he had even dodged its whips. The two were strongly connected, and the instant they dodged and passed by it, Lee Shin Woo forcefully cut through its injured area and inflicted an even larger injury.\n\"You were after another’s treasure, so you’re ready to give up your own, right?\"\n[Kuuooooooh....?]\nSteve, who hadn’t taken a single step back thus far, emitted a weak sound in front of Lee Shin Woo.\nIf he were to interpret what it just said, it would roughly come out to, ’D-Do you want to call it a draw...?’ or something like that. Of course, Lee Shin Woo acted like he hadn’t even heard it.\n\"Then, Steve.\"\nLee Shin Woo, confirming that Steve didn’t even have a drop of mana left, naturally switched out his weapon and raised it. The double handed axe within his hand glowed an ominous dark green.\n\"Shall we see where you’re hiding your treasure?\"\nFive minutes later, Lee Shin Woo was covered in rotten flesh, bone powder, and blood, and was greeted with a message he had been looking forward to.\n[You have hunted a Lv5 Treasure Eater. You have acquired 225,000 Perium.]\n[You have acquired a Lv5 Treasure Eater’s tailbone.]\n[You have acquired a Lv5 Drake Horn Lance. Though it’s possible to change it through Bone Reinforcement, Bone Reinforcement is still lacking, so the change is cancelled.]",

    "content": "<Chapter 12. Joker Apprentice - 2>\nLevels were an absolute standard by which organic and inorganic beings were divided. It was also the standard which discriminated between the superior and the inferior. ...Because of that, those who surmount those standards are given an unconventional reward for their efforts.\nThat was karma, the very basis of this world that was more absolute than even levels.\n[You succeeded in meting out your revenge against a stronger foe. All stats have increased by 2. The Low Rank Avenger skill has become Lv2. The skill duration time increases.]\nOvercoming the difference of even just one level was extremely difficult. Even if one possessed the Avenger skill, it was a karma that could only be achieved by staking one’s life on it. Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs novelFirｅ.net\nIf that’s the case, what about a two level difference? Others would call it brash. They would never attempt it, unless they had several lives. Even if they did have several lives, fighting with a two level difference was like trying to break a rock with an egg, so there wouldn’t be many who would attempt it and risk their precious lives.\n[You have defeated a foe two levels higher than you! It is an achievement that has never been seen before in history. All stats have increased by 5. You have acquired the title ’He Who Conquers the Impossible’. Whenever you attempt to challenge the impossible and succeed, you become stronger.]\nHowever, what if that egg were extremely tough, and instead of egg yolk and egg white within, it was filled with explosives? What about if that rock was hammered away and cracked?\nHe would achieve each and every one of those conditions, and create a stairway in order to reach that karma step by step. Those rules were everything, and it was truly akin to the way one would think in a game. It wasn’t ridiculously difficult or impossible for him to break through the wall known as levels if he properly utilized the karma that he had gathered, as well as the skills he had learned.\nEspecially since he possessed the ever-changing persona, the Joker’s karma!\n[You, who have communed with a higher leveled riding companion and defeated your foe, show a glimpse of the qualities of the one foretold in legend as the Dragon Knight. You have acquired the Dragon Knight’s karma token. All stats have increased by 5. The Low Rank Horseback Riding skill has become Lv7. Agility has increased by 5.]\n\"Ah, there are seriously a lot of messages.\"\nLee Shin Woo always thought this. That these lines weren’t enough for him to enjoy the lingering feeling of victory. It felt like he was reading a biography of what happened just a little while ago.\nBut there was also nothing better than these messages to verify his achievements. When he thought about it, perhaps God, or the world, was whispering to him. It was like they were saying, ’You have achieved such and such feat, and that was truly amazing. And that achievement makes you this much stronger.’\n\"W-We really didn’t die and won.\"\n\"If it wasn’t for you, I really would’ve died at least once.\"\n\"You...!\"\nJin must’ve been reading his messages just like Lee Shin Woo and muttered, embarrassed. Lee Shin Woo replied carefreely, but Jin belatedly recalled the situation before and raised his voice. It seemed he was also upset, as he stamped on the ground a few times.\n\"I can’t believe you. A person could be momentarily scared in a fight, and yet you see that and say you’ll fight alone?\"\n\"Well, I thought you might really die at that rate. I have a lot of extra lives, but you only have two.\"\n\"Still, how can I help you if I always just back off when it gets dangerous? That doesn’t seem like a proper contract!\"\nHe was right. Lee Shin Woo didn’t accept Jin because he needed a car. He believed that he would become stronger through Jin’s help, so he decided to work together with him.\nHonestly, in the recent battle, the both of them hadn’t died and were able to kill Steve because of their deeply developed bond.\n\"But if you actually die, you’ll probably be really pissed.\"\n\"You don’t need to worry about that. This is the path I’ve chosen, so I’m plenty prepared for it. So in the future, whether I’m scared or I freeze, just move me as you please and charge forward. Got it?\"\nWhen he heard Jin’s unwavering voice, he sounded like a general. However, in actuality, the meaning behind his message was something like ’At the very least, Lee Shin Woo could use him as a horse while in battle’. It seems like Jin was humiliated from being temporarily frightened from the enemy.\n\"If that’s what you want, then that’s what I’ll do. I won’t be considerate of you in the future and tell you to back off.\"\n\"Good. Just think about winning against the enemy. Because if you don’t, I won’t be able to get stronger either.\"\nIs he beginning to understand karma, the system that rules this world? Hearing Jin comment on the important parts of karma, Lee Shin Woo naturally nodded his head.\nBut that state of mind would certainly be dangerous for Jin, so he decided that from now on, he would figure out a way for Jin to more actively absorb more of the curse’s magic.\nShould he go check at the secret shop? But before that, he’d need to deal with the level up... Wait, the level up?\n\"Huh?\"\nLee Shin Woo tilted his head and checked his status; he realized that he had already acquired the qualifications to level up to level 4.\nWhen he thought about it, a few of his skills leveled up during the battle, and his Combat Sprint was even reborn as Combat Sense, an intermediate level skill! So there was no way his stats hadn’t risen over 800!\n\"But I ignored it all because I was concentrating on the battle.\"\n\"Was there an easier way to win by any chance?\"\n\"No, there wasn’t. If I had acted like I was going to level up, I probably would’ve been hit and pointlessly die.\"\nThe level up transformation wasn’t as simple as it seemed in manga, where leveling up was as easy as changing clothes for the hero. In terms of the skeleton, Lee Shin Woo, all of his 200 bones would be fundamentally changed, and he would be reborn with a new constitution filled with new mana as well.\nBut to do that while fighting an enemy? He’d probably incur considerable damage or his level up may go wrong; it would be one of the two.\n\"Jin, stay back for now.\"\n\"Stay back? Why?\"\n\"Hmm... You should be fine, but it’s just...\"\nIf he were to say that he absorbed all the bones in his surrounding in the process of leveling up, Jin would probably say he’s crazy.\nLee Shin Woo thought Jin would figure it out if he saw it himself, shrugged his shoulders, and inspected the loot the level 5 Treasure Eater had left behind. Though he had caught a glimpse of the message before... he couldn’t believe what it said, and the ’treasure’ that needed a second inspection was right there.\n[Drake Horn Lance]\n[Lv5]\n[Durability: 2,220/2,220]\n[Attack Power: 1,000 - 1,200]\n[Options: Strength +30, Health + 30, Magic +10, Effectiveness of charge related skills +40%]\n\"Hoo...\"\nLee Shin Woo interjected as he saw the truly large and lengthy conically shaped lance that lay before him. The level 4 Melting Bone Double Axe’s power was likewise tremendous, but it seemed like a gentle breeze when compared to this lance.\n\"Wow, that looks way too cool...\"\n\"I told you, it’s dangerous if you get too close.\"\nThough he said it was dangerous, he could understand why Jin careless approached. The charm of this weapon was dimensions apart from the other weapons he’d acquire thus far!\nDid a one level difference cause this much of a difference? No, no way. This weapon was special. An item that was worth the Treasure Eater lugging around in its body! It might even match up to Lightning Tooth, which was imbued with God’s power.\nBut if there was a problem to speak of, it was that the weapon’s usage was much too limited. The lance was much too large and lengthy for him to lift and swing around. It approached 4 meters in length, and its thickness was considerable as well. It would ordinarily be impossible to wield, unless one was a 3 meter tall golem.\nNot to mention, one of the weapon’s options was to increase the effectiveness of charge related skills. In other words, it was utilized by forcefully charging at the enemy, and landing a single strike on one’s target; it was a siege weapon dedicated to this single strike.\n\"This should be important in the future, since you’re here too, Jin.\"\n\"...If you wielded this weapon, I don’t feel like I’d feel very frustrated, even if you rode on my back.\"\nLee Shin Woo imagined himself riding atop Jin and charging at a castle wall, lance in hand, and just laughed. If he excluded the fact that the knight was a skeleton, the horse was a skeleton, and even the weapons and armor were bones, it was something that came straight from a fairy tale.\n’I hope you endure within my inventory until that time comes.’\nLee Shin Woo carefully opened his inventory and placed the lance inside. Of course, he likewise placed his axe, sword, helmet, armor, and lower body armor inside. Seeing Lee Shin Woo suddenly giving him a nude body show, Jin was appalled.\n\"Why the hell are you suddenly stripping!?\"\n\"Whether I wear them or not, I’m just bones, so who cares?\"\n\"Ugh, this is why being with a guy is...\"\n\"You know you’re drooling, right?\"\n\"...\"\nHe placed all his equipment into his inventory and took out the Weapon Trickster’s Arm bone. Though he had failed in the past, he thought it might be possible the moment he leveled up. Well, trying wouldn’t hurt.\n\"Then, should I start with Steve’s tailbone... Jin, it might be really dangerous, so stay back.\"\n\"Alright, alright. Let’s see how rowdy it gets.\"\nHe realized that suppressing the evolution to level 4 was actually extremely difficult. It was only natural, since it was normal that he accept the karma once he was qualified.\nHe made sure he was a safe distance away from Jin, and then, nodded his head and loosened his hold on the mana he had been suppressing. At that moment, a ridiculously powerful mana burst out and he floated into the air! Seeing that, Jin yelled in astonishment.\n\"It really is rowdy!?\"\nFor starters, Lee Shin Woo used the karma tokens he had collected thus far, or more precisely, he absorbed them.\nBefore he gathered the 10 tokens, they couldn’t become a whole karma, but the Joker’s karma, which loved its owner’s countless personas, accepted them all. Though he couldn’t have another whole karma, Lee Shin Woo would be able to endlessly mimic those karmas almost perfectly!\n[You have accepted level 4’s karma. The Joker’s karma absorbs a portion of the countless karmas you have collected, and an unknown potential is added. All stats have increased by 10. The Acting skill has become Lv7.]\nOf course, this was only the beginning. Following the absorption of the karma tokens, Bone Reinforcement absorbed the bone of the recently hunted Treasure Eater.\n[Absorbing the Lv5 Treasure Eater’s tail bone through Bone Reinforcement. Health has increased by 9, and Magic by 18. Absorbing the target’s intact memories and experiences. Resonating with all the memories and experiences, as well as the standardized skills you have acquired accordingly.]\n[The Joker’s karma has tied all the chaos into one. The Low Rank Catapult skill, the Low Rank Harden skill, and the Low Rank Self-Destruct skill have been absorbed. You have acquired the active skill, Rule of Bone Lv3. All stats have increased by 5.]\n[The Rule of Bone and Low Rank Mana Bone are resonating. The Low Rank Mana Bone skill has become Lv8. Magic has increased by 4. The mana consumption of Rule of Bone decreases.]\nAs a result, the Treasure Eater’s ability of strengthening and manipulating its blood was adjusted for him, and transformed into the ’Rule of Bone’. Lee Shin Woo could manipulate a portion of his body (his bones) just like the Treasure Eater had with its blood; he even had the ability to target his bones and strengthen them.\nThe Catapult skill, which could shoot in every way, was already at its max potential, so as he naturally absorbed the karma, the skill would obviously upgrade... However, Lee Shin Woo hadn’t expected that both Harden and Self-Destruct would be absorbed.\n’Wait, so absorbing the skills means that the Rule of Bone skill either includes both the Harden ability as well as the Self-Destruct ability, or it has some sort of latent potential. Truthfully, using those abilities is still possible... and since it actually resonates with the Mana Bone skill, its effectiveness increases. Then does that mean that the Rule of Bone doesn’t have any more room for growth in the future....?’\nHe had his suspicions in other places as well. The Rule of Bone was like the Acting skill, Bone Reinforcement, and Invisible Heart, as they likewise didn’t have something indicating their rank. From now on, it would either have little room for growth, or it wouldn’t grow at all; he couldn’t think of it as anything else.\n’In any case, I’m sure it’s an amazing skill that exceeds all the skills I gained in the past... Huh?’\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo admired the latent potential of the Rule of Bone, tremendous mana burst forth once more. Lee Shin Woo briefly didn’t know what was happening, but he soon saw something floating in front of him.\n[Absorbing the Lv6 Weapon Trickster’s arm bone through Bone Reinforcement.]\nIt was none other than the Weapon Trickster’s arm bone. The arm bone that hadn’t reacted thus far radiated light and was finally being absorbed.\nIt wasn’t possible for him when he was level 3, but now that he’d acquired the Joker’s karma which went beyond the Trickster’s, and had evolved to level 4, it was barely possible!\n[All stats have increased by 10. You have learned the active skill, Bone Armory Lv1. Magic has increased by an additional 5.]\nAs expected, it was an outrageous stat increase, befitting of a level 6 bone! Moreover, he gained another rankless skill. This was certainly Weapon Trickster’s core ability!\nHowever, the instant his two eyes gleamed with anticipation (though his eyes don’t light up yet), something happened.\n[You have acquired the Weapon Trickster’s power, and are accepting all the karma that you ought to have.]\n\"...Huh?\"\nHe felt as though he had seen this ominous line somewhere before, and Lee Shin Woo trembled. His inventory opened above his head. Lee Shin Woo felt as though all the blood in his body was draining. Though he didn’t have any!\n\"Wait, don’t do this. Please don’t...!\"\n[Absorbing all equipment through Bone Reinforcement.]\nThe Dire Wolf Armor, Acid Ghoul Skull Helm, Grizzly Bone Leg... as well as the Melting Bone Double Axe, the Lightning Tooth, and the recently acquired Drake Horn Lance all dropped to the floor.\nAnd all of them were entirely absorbed by Lee Shin Woo.",

Or was it because he was dejected that his precious treasures were all absorbed through Bone Reinforcement? Or perhaps was it due to him finding out a weakness in the Joker karma that he hadn’t even imagined? He thought he was going to become a complete Joker, yet he got a useless tag attached to it; maybe it was because of that?\nOf course, that wasn’t all.\n’This is a really peculiar feeling... I remember all the memories regarding the absorbed equipment.’\nHis memory of the recently absorbed equipment was so clear that he felt like he could actually draw and see those items if he wanted. He had heard that it was important to possess a deep understanding of one’s weapon, but it wasn’t the level of merely handling the weapon, but actually making them.\nHe could presume why. Compared to before leveling up, his skills had changed the most, and of those skills, Bone Armory was the most drastic! Lee Shin Woo didn’t waste time and called for the information regarding Bone Armory.\n[Bone Armory Lv1 (Active)]\n[As a result of extracting the Weapon Trickster’s memories and experiences, who had freely transformed weapons and cajoled the battlefield, a skill has formed solely for your use. You record all information on equipment made of bone, and you can summon them by using mana.]\n[Your abilities are still lacking, so you can only summon the equipment in their recorded state. You can manifest and maintain two pieces of equipment at most. Maintaining the equipment does not cost any mana.]\n[Recorded Equipment:\nLv3 Dire Wolf Bone Armor (Defense 110 - 125)\nLv3 Grizzly Bone Leg (Defense 105 - 115)\nLv4 Acid Skull Helm (Defense 250 - 310) - Effectiveness of Acid Type Skills +10%\nLv4 Lightning Tooth (Attack Power 450 - 480) - Lightning Lv4, Power of Bursting Thunder Skill +20%\nLv4 Melting Bone Double Axe (Attack Power 480 - 470) - Acid Lv3, Effectiveness of Acid Type Skills + 20%\nLv5 Drake Bone Lance (Attack Power 1,000 - 1,200) - Effectiveness of Charge-related Skills +40%]\n[Equipment summoned through Bone Armory cannot be targeted with Bone Reinforcement.]\n\"As I thought...!\"\nLee Shin Woo was relieved that his equipment wasn’t lost forever, but he also realized that this skill wasn’t perfect.\nThere were two main problems right now. First, it was impossible to reinforce the recorded equipment any further. Second, because the level of the skill was low, he could only summon two pieces of equipment at a time. Considering that he’d need a weapon in a combat situation, he would end up only being able to equip one piece of armor.\n\"But it’s a lot better than completely losing them, so should I just let it go...\"\nHe felt like hanging himself when he saw the Lightning Tooth and the Drake Horn Lance being absorbed, so he felt grateful when he learned he would be able to wield them again. Especially since he was able to completely absorb all of their associated stat bonuses.\nIf he leveled up the skill, he would probably be able to summon and maintain more equipment. Lee Shin Woo decided to think about it positively. When he thought about it, he wouldn’t need to worry about repairing damaged equipment from now on.\n\"...Wait a sec.\"\n\"Shin Woo? Shin Woo, are you alright?\"\nThe concerned Jin approached and asked, since Lee Shin Woo had been muttering to himself since the level up process began; however, Lee Shin Woo’s mind was only focused on one thing, so he didn’t even hear Jin speak.\n’Isn’t the bone equipment summoned through the Bone Armory made of bones as well? Plus, they’re bones that I’ve made.’\nIf that’s the case, then... will they be affected by the Rule of Bone skill? Lee Shin Woo went straight ahead and tried to put into practice what he just thought about. The weapon he summoned was naturally the one he was most familiar with, the Lightning Tooth!\n\"Oh, those weren’t just absorbed?\"\n\"Fortunately, no.\"\nThe summoned Lightning Tooth was no different from the one he possessed before absorbing it. Aside from the stat bonuses, everything else was exactly the same.\nBut the Lightning Tooth retained a lot of experiences within, so perhaps that’s why the mana consumption was tremendous; he would need to figure out just how long he could maintain the weapon.[2]\n’...Then.’\nLee Shin Woo naturally focused all his concentration on the Lightning Tooth in his hand. Though it wasn’t made of his own bones, it was definitely composed of bone formed by his own mana. Then, couldn’t this weapon be considered a part of his body?\n’The conditions for using Rule of Bone shouldn’t simply be that it’s a bone physically attached to my body. If it’s a weapon formed by my mana, then it should definitely... that’s right.’\nHis wish had come true. The Lightning Tooth escaped his fingertips and began floating all on its own. Moving it was still a bit unstable, but that was due to the low level of Rule of Bone, and soon, even that slight shaking lessened.\n\"Have you gained telekinesis!?\"\n\"In terms of bones, then yeah, maybe.\"\nJin asked in astonishment and Lee Shin Woo roughly replied whilst flying the Lightning Tooth higher into the air. In no time, the long sword flew much higher into the air than just above his head, and spun round and round according to his will; it was truly a menacing sight.\n’Just moving it around doesn’t cost much mana.’\nLee Shin Woo, who had learned that Rule of Bone applied to the weapons summoned through Bone Armory, brought the Lightning Tooth before him once more and reinforced the Lightning Tooth through Rule of Bone. It didn’t consume much mana, and the amount of reinforcement was...\n\"Ooh.\"\nThe Lightning Tooth radiated a bright blue light, and the blade emitted even more light than before; he even saw it openly begin to discharge sparks.\nContrary to the Harden skill which simply increased the degree of hardness, Rule of Bone reinforced every aspect of the weapon. As a result, its lightning element had been improved as well!\n\"...It’s perfect.\"\nHe muttered in awe as he saw product of the harmony between the Rule of Bone and the Bone Armory skills.\nThis was only the beginning. If he improved these skills from now on, how diverse would it become!? It would become a skill that wouldn’t shame the name Trickster!\n\"Heup!\"\n\"Whoa!\"\nHe had retained the know-how behind the Catapult skill and launched the Lightning Tooth in the air forward. Though the Rule of Bone was still a low level, it wasn’t any slower than the Catapult he’d used up until now!\n- Kwang!\nIt didn’t stray even once from its route, and the launched long sword rammed into the hill. The mountain boomed and the impact from the sword ended up destroying a portion of the hill; however, it had lodged so deeply in that he couldn’t even see the hilt.\nSeeing that, Jin suddenly trembled.\n\"You... You’re going to do it, aren’t you?\"\n\"Yep. I’m going to do it.\"\n\"If another monstrous bastard comes from hearing that sound, you’re on your own.\"\n\"Right.\"\nHonestly, since he’d acquired the Rule of Bone from facing the Treasure Eater, wouldn’t it be advantageous to prepare to face and kill another one? As he thought such idle thoughts... he activated Rule of Bone once more.\n\"Synapse, burst![1]\"\n\"Synapse?\"\n-Kwaaaaaang!\nThe sword erupted in a tremendous explosion. It was a much more horrific explosion than before when he’d exploded his arm; it was obvious, considering the fact that one of the hills had been completely destroyed. It was truly impressive seeing the sparks popping out from the collapsed hill.\n\"Ugh, the mana consumption’s tremendous...!\"\nBut he had figured out exactly how much it cost. He had only blown up one long sword, but it had sucked up almost all of his mana! Considering the fact that its destructive force was greater than Self-Destruct’s, it still felt like an advantageous skill.\n\"Hey, couldn’t you have killed that caterpillar with one shot of that...?\"\n\"Yeah, but if I miss, I would’ve died in one shot, too.\"\nLee Shin Woo sat down and focused as much as he could on absorbing the surrounding mana. As Jin said, there was always the possibility that a monster heard the boom and would come dashing over, so he needed to replenish his mana in case of a battle. Jin was astonished once again.\n\"It’s to the point that I feel the flow of the mana being drawn to you!?\"\n\"It’s because my Mana Affinity naturally went up as I leveled up.\"\nThat was only natural. As he levelled up to level 4, his stat effectiveness increased by another 20%, his Magic stat included.\nEspecially since his Mana Bone skill was strengthened by Rule of Bone; his mana recovery rate had increased by about 1.5x compared to before. That meant it wasn’t impossible to feel the flow of mana as if it were the wind.\n\"You’ve just become level 4, but how much are you...\"\nHe had completely destroyed a hill with one skill and could swiftly replenish that mana. Because of Lee Shin Woo’s achievements, Jin couldn’t believe that Lee Shin Woo was a hero at the same level as him, and just stood dumbfounded.\n’The more you level up, the more your stats are amplified. It’s probably even higher at level 5 or level 6. If I’m at this level, then my seniors, the other undead, and especially the named undead are...’\nBut at the same time, he recognized with certainty that levels were no longer the absolute standard in this world. If they had been, then Lee Shin Woo would never have been able to defeat the level 5 Treasure Hunter. Even if he had been helped by Jin, the results would’ve been the same.\nAt that moment when he’d concentrated to his very limit during the battle, Lee Shin Woo and Jin had both overcome their limits and were barely able to defeat the Treasure Eater. What were the factors that made that possible? His concentration? His will? It wasn’t anything so abstract.\n’It’s how one uses their stats... Stats that cannot be used are the same as rotten bones. Skills are the means by which you can push your stats to their limits and even overcome those limit; and ultimately, at the center of those countless skills, it’s important to use them at the right time. Like Combat Sense...’\nLee Shin Woo realized that he had fully replenished his mana as he was immersed in such deep thoughts, and suddenly opened his eyes (or a feeling like that). And then, Jin, who was watching over him, suddenly spoke.\n\"Now that I think about it, you have goblin fire now too.\"\n\"Really!?\"\nHearing that, Lee Shin Woo hastily touched his face, but it was obviously still bone as usual. However, he definitely felt heat within his eye sockets. He asked Jin a question, whilst thinking that he’d never once wanted a mirror more desperately than right now.\n\"What about the color? Are they blue like yours?\"\n\"They’re a deep red.\"\n\"Damn.\"\nWrinkles formed upon Lee Shin Woo’s forehead (that kind of impression). He was happy that he’d evolved and gained flames, but if he passed by another undead and looked different, it would be difficult to use his Acting skill!\n\"Well, even if they consider you the strange one, it would be difficult to use the Acting skill. Fine, I need to plan out a proper scenario...\"\n\"I’m really scared of your thought process...\"\n\"But let’s go to the secret shop first. Normally, whenever I level up, I go to the secret shop and buy the most expensive bone. That’s my spending pattern.\"\n\"Ah, that?\"\nBecause Jin hadn’t actively wanted to do something in this world before, he had never gone to the secret shop either. He didn’t seem to be regretful at all, and just shrugged his shoulders as he looked at Lee Shin Woo.\n\"I don’t even have any money.\"\n\"Now that I think about it, that’s a bit strange. There should be a share for you from the monsters that I hunt, so why isn’t any money coming out for you?\"\nIt wasn’t like that when he had hunted the ghoul with Ye Jin Jin in the past. At that time, Perium didn’t drop for Jin, but it did for Ye Jin Jin. There was definitely some sort of secret there.\nHowever, he figured out the secret in the next moment. It was at the very moment when Lee Shin Woo was about to enter the secret shop!\n[There exists an entity who is contracted to you. You can enter the secret shop together.]\n\"Hmm?\"\nThe contract. It definitely pointed to Jin. Strangely, at that moment, Lee Shin Woo figured out the circumstances surrounding them. He looked straight and Jin and spoke.\n\"It says we can go together. Do you want to go?\"\n\"Huh? Well... if we can go together, I might as well look around.\"\nHe would just feel uneasy if he were left alone. Then, it should be better to go with Lee Shin Woo, even if he didn’t do anything there. Thinking that, Jin nodded his head and Lee Shin Woo used one of the permits right away. The surrounding landscape instantaneously melted away and soon, he was met with an unfamiliar sight.\n\"Guten Tag!\"\nIt was an extremely simple square space, with a counter on only one side; and from beyond that counter, a red haired beauty gazed at and greeted them in German for a reason unbeknownst to them.\n\"Why did you come again so soon... Oh my.\"\nPleine possessed the ability to ascertain one’s skill quite easily. However, even if it wasn’t her, it would’ve been easy for someone else to figure out that Lee Shin Woo had leveled up this time. Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on novel⚑fire.net\nThe power his body was giving off was definitely different. Above all, his eye sockets blazed with red flames, so there was no way she’d not know.\n\"I thought it would take you quite a long time to go from level 3 to level 4, yet you’ve surprised me once again. You’re even half way to level 5.\"\nIn the process of leveling up, he had attained several karmas, as well as leveled up his skills, but the deciding factor was that all of the equipment he’d gathered thus far had been absorbed, causing his stats to surpass 1,200 in total.\nFor one to reach level 5, they needed a total of 1,600 stats, and Pleine’s statement that he was halfway there was right on the money.\n\"It’s really a frightening ability. You’re just looking at my stats, right?\"\n\"I would never. In order to give you better aid, I simply received some information on you when you dropped underground. I cannot ascertain your always changing stats. Customer, if you gain some more experience, you should be able to do this kind of measurement. ...Hmm?\"\nIt took quite a while for Pleine to realize that another customer was there, as Lee Shin Woo’s transformation was so shocking. When Pleine turned her attention to him, Jin thought that she was an extremely beautiful lady, and awkwardly bowed his head.\n\"Hello.\"\n\"Oh... my...\"\nSeeing the Skeleton Horse that indifferently stood beside Lee Shin Woo, she gaped, but she soon seemed to realize what she was doing and nodded her head.\n\"To think that you’d form a contract with another hero; and especially since that hero is... Customer, you haven’t been to the secret shop before, right?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nJin replied, and Pleine smiled deeply. He felt uncomfortable seeing that smile and slightly shook, so Lee Shin Woo spoke for Jin.\n\"Are you saying that this contract causes our respective karmas to influence the other?\"\n\"You’re right on. You not only share the Perium that your enemies drop, but you can also visit me together, as well as somewhat passing on your karma to each other when using items that you’ve acquired from the shop. Especially if that contract deepens; the deeper the contract, the more deeply you can use each other’s karma.\"\n\"It’s something that important, yet I have no idea how that contract was formed...\"\n\"Me too...\"\n\"Pfft.\"\nPleine ended up bursting into laughter seeing the two skeleton heroes tilt their heads at her. It was a rare spectacle, even though she was the one who managed the secret shop.\nShe laughed for quite a while, putting aside the two sullen looking heroes, then barely managed to begin explaining.\n\"There are a few bonds that closely tie two people together in this world. Of them, a contract is the most sacred and deepest bond. Therefore, one needs to possess a skill that can connect the two of you together, and then, mutual consent is required. So you have a rough idea now, right?\"\n\"Aha.\"\nHe had somewhat expected this, but he was right. Lee Shin Woo recollected his Bone Reinforcement skill, and nodded his head.\nTo him, his Bone Reinforcement was just a reinforcement ability, but to others, the moment he used Bone Reinforcement on them, a connection would form between them. That had appeared in the form of a contract between him and Jin.\n\"Is there any chance that there’ll be harmful side effects to the target of the contract...?\"\n\"You already know somewhat, but because it’s a contract that formed out of concern for one another, there aren’t any negative side effects. However, the target of the contract can saddle all of your karma, so you cannot take it lightly.\"\nIt seemed as though Lee Shin Woo and Jin had formed a successful contract; it was because they had agreed beforehand that they’d work together that this contract was possible. Especially since they could open up to each other as they were both skeletons...\nHowever, he was now absolutely sure that Bone Reinforcement had formed the contract between them. Listening to what Pleine had to say, he thought even if he used Bone Reinforcement on someone else in the future, he would be careful not to form a contract with them.\n\"In any case, I have a rough idea of what’s going on. On how you were able to grow this quickly, Mr. Lee Shin Woo. Of course, it’s not entirely because of that...\"\n\"Do you want me to tell you my story again?\"\n\"No.\"\nPleine unexpectedly shook her head with a firm look.\n\"It’s not that I’m not curious, but the timing’s not ideal. It doesn’t seem like it’s a story that I can hear with just a 20,000 Perium discount, so... let’s leave that to next time, and for now let’s trade, shall we?\"\nPleine spoke, and looked straight at Jin, not Lee Shin Woo.\nJin, who’d received Pleine’s gaze, simply tilted his head.\n[1] T/N: I assume this is a reference to what Rikka Takanashi says in the anime Love, Chunibyo, and Other Delusions.\n[2] E/N: It does say he’s trying to figure out how long he can maintain it. It likely refers to something other than mana.",

    "content": "<Chapter 12. Joker Apprentice - 4>\nSince Pleine was well aware of what Lee Shin Woo wanted, she didn’t waste time and immediately placed bones atop the counter; this time, there was a total of three bones he could choose from.\n\"These are the three most expensive level 5 bones. Starting from the left, they cost 290,000, 310,000, and 370,000 Perium. Oh, and for your reference, they’re all named.\"\nSimilarly to heroes, monsters also gain a sharp increase in strength the higher their level, and naturally, the karma that they leave behind... their bones’ value is beyond one’s imagination.\nThe most expensive level 4 bone had cost around 90,000 Perium, yet a bone just one level higher cost 200,000 - 300,000 more, verifying the truth to that statement. Even considering the fact that they were named, it was quite a severe increase.\n\"Just as there are few high leveled monsters, it is likewise the same for humans as well. A person who reached level 4 in the past Underground Empire couldn’t easily be confronted. The renowned elite group known as the Empire’s Knights also started at level 4.\"\n\"You’re saying that I’m only at the level of a knight?\"\n\"That’s not what I’m saying. Customer, you’re an elite hero amongst elites, so it’s difficult to compare you so simply. If everyone’s ability was the same just because they were the same level, then there wouldn’t be people who pursue special or unique karma. ...You should already be well aware of how special you are.\"\nHe couldn’t fool her. Lee Shin Woo slightly sighed and examined the bones that she’d offered. For starters, there wasn’t a blue bone this time.\nWell, his fundamental mana proficiency (Mana Bone) or his mana application (Acid Poison Spray and Flames of Revenge) were attained through achievements, so he didn’t really need to pick a blue bone every time; however, he couldn’t help but have mixed feelings.\n\"How about a level 6 bone?\"\n\"You might be able to buy an ordinary level 6 bone, but... a level 6 elite bone starts at 1.5 million Perium.\"\n\"Hmm, I see.\"\nLee Shin Woo neatly discarded his ambitions for a level 6 bone. Since it was much better to obtain a level 5 elite monster bone than an ordinary level 6 monster bone.\nUltimately, he had no choice but to choose amongst these three... He used Mana Bone to its max and examined the three bones that lay before him. Due to his accumulated experience, he was able to more easily examine the bones now.\n’The cheapest one increases strength, and the skill within is a powerful strike similar to Power Slash. I don’t know how much it would increase my strength but it’s not very appealing to me. The next one increases health, but... Ah, it seems like it contains a skill similar to Harden.’\nHe didn’t really need this one either, since he already possessed Rule of Bone. But... Lee Shin Woo turned his eyes to the side and looked at Jin, who was expressionlessly examining the bones.\n\"? What is it?\"\n\"There’s a bone here that you need.\"\n\"Me!?\"\nJin’s agility was monstrously high, but aside from that, his other stats were lower than Lee Shin Woo’s, not to mention that Jin didn’t even have a decent skill that wasn’t related to running. That was a huge problem.\nNo matter how specialized he was in agility, he would obviously need the strength and health to use that agility more effectively, as well as the magic to supplement it. If he only focused on raising his agility, as it raised by a factor of three, he would eventually find his balance crumbling and ultimately wouldn’t be able to keep himself steady.\nHis physical condition disallowed him from equipping armor, so a skill that toughened his body would be essential for Jin.\n\"But this is too expensive... It feels kind of weird just accepting it.\"\n\"It’s an investment for my partner. Think of it as not just for yourself, but for the two of us.\"\n\"Ugh. Then what about you?\"\n\"I’m picking this one.\"\nLee Shin Woo had picked none other than the most expensive bone that cost 370,000 Perium. The mana pattern undoubtedly indicated that it increased agility. He had originally thought that he should give this one to Jin, but he decided that it would be better for him to take it, as it would balance out his growth.\n’Originally, my stats were balanced, aside from magic; but in the process of absorbing the items, my agility completely fell behind. If I consider my battlefield connection with Jin, then the most important stat has to be agility...’\nContrary to Jin, his most pressing issue was to increase his agility, which was excessively lagging behind his other stats. Their agility stats had to be somewhat close in order for him to most effectively draw out his abilities.\n\"It comes out to 680,000 Perium in total. It’s quite a sizable amount, so it should be difficult for the both of you to buy... Oh my, you’re not short?\"\n\"A lot went on, a lot.\"\nPleine looked extremely curious once again, but ultimately didn’t ask. It might be that she was being considerate to Jin, who had come here for the first time. She neatly collected the money and smiled as she backed off, which conversely made them feel uncomfortable.\n\"The next time we meet, you should be level 5. I’ll prepare level 6 bones for your next visit.\"\n\"I don’t know whether I’ll be able to gather 1.3 million Perium by then, but... I’ll see you next time.\"\nThe two immediately left the secret shop and returned underground. The shop and the accompanying red haired beauty completely disappeared, and they returned to the plains with traces of an intense battle. Then, Jin took a quick look around, sighed in relief, and spoke.\n\"I don’t want to go there again. You just go by yourself.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"I don’t like that woman. It feels like she’s looking right through me.\"\nSince it felt like Jin would kick him with his front legs if he retorted with ’But you were already filled with holes’, Lee Shin Woo kept his mouth shut, but then, at that very moment...\n[Four permits for God’s secret shop have been transferred to Jin Taylor, who is contracted to you.]\n\"So transferring stuff works too, huh...\"\nIn the past, there were times when he couldn’t use the permit whenever he wanted, as it felt wasteful, yet now, he had enough that he could go and visit Pleine whenever he was bored. Though there wasn’t a single time he was bored since he was dropped into the Empire.\n\"Then let’s start with the Bone Reinforcement.\"\n\"Do we really have to?\"\n\"I’ll give you some time to prepare.\"\nFrom the very start, there was nowhere to run for Jin. The reason he hadn’t used Bone Reinforcement on Jin all this time and had let him off (?) was because his own growth was more urgent!\nJin would be in for some wearisome days once both their stats became similar. Since he already had a hunch, Jin sported a rotten expression, but unfortunately his feelings weren’t relayed at all as he was a skeleton.\n[Executing Bone Reinforcement on Jin Taylor by consuming a Lv5 Bone Wall Knight, Predin Eltlesser’s rib bone. A portion of the target’s experiences and memories is divided and absorbed. Health has increased by 3. Proficiency in Rule of Bone has increased.]\n[We are the final defense for His Excellency. Show them the results of your training. I’ll find the one who dies first and kill them again in Hell. - Predin Eltlesser]\nAs expected, a level 5 monster’s thoughts were indeed different from the norm. He only gained a portion of those memories and experiences, but his health had increased by 3; not only that, Predin’s final moments were intensely relayed to him.\n\"Ughhhhhh.\"\nSo what would it be like for Jin, whose mind was directly injected with those memories and experiences? It’s only for an instant, but he would receive such vivid memories and experiences that it’d be a danger to his own sense of identity, and as a result, he yelled in agony and rolled onto the floor. Lee Shin Woo petted him and asked.\n\"You alright?\"\n\"I’m not alright...!\"\n\"Do you remember my name? My name’s...!\"\n\"I’m not that damaged, you know!\"\nHe had thought about engraving their names on his palms just in case, but fortunately, it doesn’t seem like he’d need to anymore. Lee Shin Woo sighed in relief, gripped his own bone, and executed Bone Reinforcement once again.\n[Executing Bone Reinforcement by consuming Lv5 Armored Bone Knight, Ashkiss Von Belita’s leg bone. Absorbing the target’s experiences and memories in their entirety. Agility has increased by 18. The Low Rank Horseback Riding skill has become Lv8. Agility has increased by 4.]\n[You’re really disobedient. But you’ll soon come to like me. There’ll eventually come a time where we ride into the battlefield together. - Ashkiss Von Belita]\n\"Mmm...\"\nThe memories that flowed into his head were that of a knight of the Empire, fully garbed in his uniform, and training a violent horse. As expected, it was definitely the ability he needed most right now.\nIt felt a bit regrettable that he hadn’t gained a new skill, but he couldn’t just keep blindly increasing the number of abilities he had, so in the meantime, he thought it’d be best to stabilize the skills he had.\n’Moreover, while the memories I’d acquired until now had awakened the Horseback Riding skill, I hadn’t been able to attain an expert’s memories. The memories and experiences I’ve just gained should be helpful for a long time to come.’\nNot only had it immediately increased the skill level of Horseback Riding by one, he was absolutely sure that the recently absorbed memories would help him increase his proficiency in the skill a lot faster. Though he didn’t know how his partner... would feel about that.\n\"Do you feel ok now?\"\n\"S-Somewhat...\"\nJin replied with a voice that didn’t sound fine whatsoever. Lee Shin Woo, who was truly worried about the goblin fire within his eye sockets that spun around dizzily, decided to test what he had just learned and got atop Jin’s back. He then focused on the connection between him and Jin.\n\"Uh... Huh...?\"\n\"Hoo...\"\nSoon, something changed. Though he was an undead, who couldn’t actually breathe, Jin had emitted harsh breathing noises; however, he calmed down quickly. The trick was simple. Through his connection with Jin, he focused on one part of Jin’s consciousness. He stopped the primary cause of confusion, and shared the burden on his mind.\n\"Take it one at a time. Just think of it as you watching an educational video.\"\n\"Easy for you to say...!\"\nBut his connection with Lee Shin Woo had certainly made the process much easier. Even as he complained, he followed Lee Shin Woo’s voice, and accepted the memories and experiences. He felt a bit ashamed, but he couldn’t tell that to Lee Shin Woo, so Jin just endured, and endured some more.\n\"...I’m really ok now.\"\n\"Nice. Then shall we go to the highlands? We have to finish up what we were doing before.\"\nJin took several deep breaths when he heard Lee Shin Woo nod his head and talk; then, he extended his legs forward. Lee Shin Woo was able to maintain their connection, even if Jin ran at a faster pace, perhaps due to his level up.\n\"But I’m still not there yet. I want to increase my agility by at least 300 more.\"\n\"I’ve already given up on catching up to your agility.\"\nSo long as Jin possessed the Child of Light skill, the disparity between their agility stats would likely continue to become more severe.\nTherefore, it was more important to maintain a full connection with Jin whilst drawing all of his abilities to the surface, rather than trying to just thoughtlessly increase his agility stat. Besides, because his Horseback Riding had just leveled up, he was able to draw 30% more speed out of Jin now!\n\"We’re here.\"\n\"You’re really frighteningly fast.\"\nIf Lee Shin Woo were alone, it would’ve taken him a few hours to walk here, but since he was with Jin, they’d arrived before he was even able to utter a few lines to him! He felt like it was a dream, but it wasn’t an illusion. The highlands were still filled with golems, and the signs of the Stone Golems allowing the Treasure Eater to pass were clear as well.\n[Sensing mana responses from living bodies. Activating.]\n[Stopping outside entry. Unless directed otherwise, automatically removing trespassers.]\nHe heard the same sounds he’d heard just a few hours ago as the golems stood up here and there. This time, the number of golems had increased significantly, perhaps due to them defeating the Treasure Eater.\nHowever, what changed the most was none other than Lee Shin Woo himself. He summoned the Melting Bone Double Axe, gripped it, and checked with Jin.\n\"Where do the level 4 golems come from?\"\n\"We have to go a bit higher for them. At our current pace, we could pass by them without fighting...\"\n\"No, it’s fine. I did need some sparring partners to adapt to my body, anyway...\" Googlᴇ search novel-fire.net\nAbove all, he realized that he needed a deeper understanding of the golems that inhabited these highlands, so... he gripped the Double Axe with one hand and lightly laughed.\n\"Then, shall we begin?\"\nThe golems, which neither grew old or died, protected the silence of these highlands, yet flames of change[1] blazed within these highlands. It didn’t take long before the flames devoured the highlands in its entirety.\n[1] T/N: Not literal flames.",

    "content": "<Chapter 12. Joker Apprentice - 5 [End of Volume 2]>\n[Unable to resist. Requesting reinforcements.]\n[Blocking enemy until reinforcements arrive.]\nThe highland’s golems could only move simply, as per their prior inputted commands, but due to that, Lee Shin Woo was able to grasp their limitations quite easily.\nWhen they realized that Lee Shin Woo was too much for them, they immediately switched to a defensive position, and waited until reinforcements came. They were certainly a lot different from the undead or monsters that just attacked while following their faintly remaining instincts.\n\"But your timing was off.\"\n[Ceasing function.]\nLee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and shattered their bodies one by one with his axe. They didn’t come at him aggressively, so the fight was boring; it was simple. No matter how long they waited, reinforcements wouldn’t come.\nPerhaps those reinforcements did indeed exist when these golems were first built and were inputted with commands, but a lot of time had passed. It was highly likely that those reinforcements either no longer existed, or the connection had been severed.\n\"Isn’t that kind of worrying?\"\nWith a single swing of his axe, he broke apart the golems; Jin, who was training the skill he’d just learned, ’Steel Body’, tilted his head and replied to the words Lee Shin Woo had just thrown out.\n\"What do you mean that their connection’s been cut?\"\n\"Well, it’s just that there are heaps of stone golems out here, even though they’re set up with an emergency call feature.\"\n[You have acquired 3,100 Perium.]\n[You have acquired a Lv3 Stone Golem Bone Core.]\nLee Shin Woo picked up the loot and surveyed the area. Although they had returned to the highlands less than an hour ago, there was less than a quarter of the Stone Golems remaining.\n\"I feel like there’s a new dungeon here.\"\n\"How about asking about it in the chatting channel?\"\n\"I asked about it before. Apparently, some of our seniors hadn’t even discovered this area before, and there are also some who have passed through this golem infested area.\"\nCurrently, Lee Shin Woo felt really suspicious, so how could his seniors not feel the same?\nHis seniors were sure that there was a dungeon somewhere nearby and told him that they’d disassembled the golems, analyzed the cores, thoroughly investigated the surrounding magic responses, and if all that didn’t work, they’d just dig up an area which seemed suspicious to them and searched the area. After all of that, the results were...\n[Prince Altania: There’s no secret facility nor a dungeon. Definitely not. If it’s something that the extraordinary Fire Magician, Altania can’t find, then there should be nothing there. There isn’t. End of story.]\nApparently that. Meaning that his senior heroes couldn’t find it. However, Jin softly gazed at Lee Shin Woo and spoke.\n\"You’re going to go looking for it, right?\"\n\"Yep. How did you know?\"\n\"You’re easy to read.\"\nTruthfully, Lee Shin Woo was somewhat confident. He didn’t even need to mention his track record of finding the secret facilities in the sewers. Didn’t he have an ability that differed from his seniors? That ability was none other than Bone Reinforcement.\n\"Bone Cores... Will you really be able to gain the memories of it from them?\"\n\"When I tried it last time, there was definitely some recorded information about it inside.\"\nBut there was a problem: the memories were limitlessly vague and were difficult to accept. Was it best to describe it like reading a letter in computer code? It would be a difficult, long-term war, but Lee Shin Woo was confident. He already had an idea of what part he had to latch onto.\n\"I just have to keep absorbing them until I understand. It’s not impossible.\"\n\"What exactly were you doing in your own world before all this?\"\n\"I was just a normal salaryman.\"\n\"You’re kidding me.\"\nIf Jin knew how much effort someone had to put in to become a normal salaryman in South Korea, he wouldn’t say something like that. Lee Shin Woo just clicked his tongue.\nWhile conversing, his hand didn’t remain idle. Whenever he discovered a golem, he would immediately dash over to it, break it apart with his axe, or throw his axe... It was only possible because his strength had increased by leaps and bounds after leveling up to level 4.\n’Moreover, Rule of Bone reinforces the bones that make up my body. Plus, the mana that I absorb in real time can replenish the maintenance cost...’\nIt wasn’t on the level of a skill that just launched a bone or controlled it from a distance. Rule of Bone was a cheat skill that would buff anything that was related to bones.\nThe buff wasn’t very significant right now, but the higher he leveled the skill, the more he’d be able to make full use of the ability. Maybe he’d acquired a skill that was like the Avenger skill, which allowed him to overcome the limit known as levels. He suddenly felt gracious towards the Treasure Eater.\n\"Have you sorted everything out now?\"\n\"There’s nothing else, so... Probably?\"\nThree hours passed. Lee Shin Woo and Jin maintained their incredible mobility and searched the very outskirts of the highlands, all while neatly taking down all of the Stone Golems. Regardless of where they went, the Stone Golems would call for ’reinforcements’, but they never appeared.\nYet the Stone Golems in the area adjacent to them wouldn’t move. He was absolutely sure by now. Their command system had already completely collapsed. They had either been thrown away or abandoned.\n’If that’s the case, then there’s only one question left. Why were so many golems left here, when there’s nothing even here? It’s unlikely that they moved here from where they were originally or that their previous owner told them to move here. There must be something around here that has a deep connection with their last command.’\nHe completed his thoughts and raised his head. He hadn’t yet absorbed the Bone Cores that he’d collected. Before he absorbed the Bone Cores, he studied them to confirm they’d have an effect on him. It’s likely that if he collected more Bone Cores, the outcome would be even greater.\n\"So if we go to the centermost area, you’re saying that level 4 golems will appear, huh.\"\n\"That’s true, but they seemed really rusty. Apparently, they were called Bronze Golems.\"\nThe Bronze Golems came after the Stone Golems. Based on the sequence of these names, wouldn’t a level 5 named, elite Iron Golem appear? Lee Shin Woo felt slightly excited and entered the middle of the highlands.\n[Ceasing function...]\n[You have hunted a Lv4 Bronze Golem. You have acquired 5,120 Perium.]\n[You have acquired a Reinforced Autonomous Defense Type Core. The Reinforced Autonomous Defense Type Core has transformed into the Reinforced Autonomous Defense Type Bone Core.]\nThe Bronze Golem was definitely a lot sturdier and heavier than a Stone Golem, to such an extent that they could certainly boast that they were level 4 monsters. Though each of their strikes were powerful, they hadn’t been maintained over a long period of time, so just like Jin said, they were rusted.\n[Eliminating... Trespasser...]\n\"They’re seriously so slow.\"\n[Ceasing function...]\nAnd while they were more powerful than Stone Golems, they were that much slower than them as well; it actually felt like it was easier to kill the Bronze Golems than the Stone Golems.\nWhat’s worse, the Stone Golems’ bodies were composed of bronze, so they couldn’t pick up nearby rocks like Stone Golems and use them to heal their bodies; and because of that, they couldn’t bombard them like the Stone Golems had either!\n\"Heup!\"\n\"Ugh, I can feel the recoil...!\"\n\"Endure with Steel Body. This is all training, too! Let’s go again!\"\n\"Urgh...\"\nLee Shin Woo struck once, or even twice with his axe at maximum strength. Because their bodies were so damn tough and thick, his weapon would eventually get worn, but when his weapon became unusable, he would explode it and summon a new axe.\nLee Shin Woo was gradually starting to like Bone Armory more and more. And at the same time...\n[The Bone Armory skill has become Lv2. Health and Magic has increased by 3. The number of equipment you can create and maintain has increased to 3.]\n\"Nice.\"\nWhen Lee Shin Woo saw that line of text, he immediately summoned the Dire Wolf Bone Armor and equipped it. If he just increased its level by 1, he would probably be able to equip his lower body armor again!\nJin said it was better if Lee Shin Woo’s lower body was covered instead of his upper body, but he completely ignored him. There was no naked or not naked for skeletons.\n\"This way, kids!\"\n[Eliminating... Trepasser...]\n[Surrounding and eliminating...!]\n\"Nice, then... Synapse, burst!\"\n\"So what the hell is a synapse!?\"\n[Critical Hit!]\nWhen his Bone Armory had leveled up, the excited Lee Shin Woo began to use the skill more actively in battle. He would gather the slow Bronze Golems in one spot, throw his axe towards them, and blow it up!\nThough the explosive force behind his axe was tremendous, there was something even greater; when he exploded his axe that possessed level 3 acid within, a powerful cloud of Acid Poison would accompany the explosion.\n[Outer gloves... have disappeared. Need to... swap parts.]\n[Impossible... No reinforcements...] The source of thɪs content is NovєlFіre.net\n[Ceasing... function...]\nThe powerful Acid Poison that resided within the weapon was amplified by the force of the explosion and engulfed the entire area. The Bronze Golems just melted away as they didn’t have any particular resistance to acid. It was really easy to take down ten Bronze Golems all at once as long as he gathered them up properly.\n\"Moreover, it’s great that the mana consumption’s much less than when I’d blown up the Lightning Tooth.\"\n\"How far are you trying to go, anyway?\"\n\"Hmm, about the Bomber level?\"\nHowever, the moment Lee Shin Woo responded and took a step forward to collect the loot, a message that he’d become familiar with finally appeared.\n[You have defeated several powerful enemies with a horrific explosion. You have the ability to wait for opportunities, as well as make split second decisions. Above all, you have the impressive ability of blowing up whatever you want. You have acquired the Bomber karma token. Strength and Magic have increased by 5. The Joker karma absorbs the Bomber karma token.]\n\"I’m speechless. It’s not like I did anything spectacular.\"\n\"Are you saying that on purpose to make me feel shameful?\"\nLee Shin Woo smiled bitterly in response and collected the rest of the loot. However, the moment that the Bone Cores in his hand overlapped, it seemed as though his skill had misunderstood his intent and this message popped up.\n[Would you like to reinforce the Reinforced Autonomous Defense Type Core by consuming a Reinforced Autonomous Defense Type Core?]\n\"!?\"\nThen, he suddenly had an idea. A great hint had appeared that could topple this current situation!\nNormally, Bone Reinforcement would either consume a piece of bone or bone equipment to either reinforce his own bones, or reinforce his bone equipment. While he had thought that he could use them to reinforce his bones or his bone equipment, he hadn’t thought that he’d be able to use the Bone Cores on each other and reinforce them...!\n’Would it be better to bet on this, or not....?’\nLee Shin Woo was conflicted. Of course, he was familiar with how a piece of equipment would transform when reinforced to +10, but what about cores?\nThere was a chance of failure, so he wondered whether he should use them separately, or combine them. Would there be some sort of new quality to the fused core? He had thought intensely for just a brief moment, but at the end of it he nodded his head.\n’Let’s take our chances.’\nIt was a decision that was very much like him, as he had never been let down from operating based on his intuition ever since he’d come to this world.\nBut now wasn’t the time. He needed to investigate further into the Autonomous Defense Type Bone Core and the Reinforced Autonomous Defense Type Bone Core, and he also wanted to try absorbing a few more of them. After that, he’d start his Bone Core reinforcement plan in earnest.\n\"Alright, Jin. Let’s go a bit faster.\"\n\"I’ve always been running at full speed ever since we’ve met.\"\nHearing Lee Shin Woo, Jin just briefly sighed and complied, increasing his speed. He’d already decided to help Lee Shin Woo, and he also didn’t hate going faster!\nHis proficient kiting skill steadily gathered the Bronze Golems in the middle of the highlands. If any heroes who could use magic saw them, they would all feel jealous of his ability to gather mobs! That ability was beginning to bear fruit on the outskirts of the Empire.",

    "content": "<Chapter 13. Arema Steelworker - 1>\n[Resistance, impossible. Requesting reinforcements... Code unrecognizable. Reporting to command... failed.]\n[Reporting to code name A.S.]\nThe Bronze Golems spoke similarly to the Stone Golems, yet said something different after Lee Shin Woo had broken all but the last two into pieces of bronze.\n[No answer. Retrying...]\n[Reporting to code name A.S. again. ...No signal.]\n\"Wait a sec. A.S.? The code name is a service center?[1]\"\nLee Shin Woo vacantly listened to the golems, and right as he was about to ready his finishing blow, he heard their strange remarks and stopped his axe. Jin then spoke.\n\"They said they had no signal, right?\"\n\"It’s not like they had no signal, but that they’ve been all killed, right?\"\nIt seems like the two’s opinions were in accord. The Bronze Golems, having no signal, froze in place as if they were damaged, but he didn’t have the time to worry about them anymore.\n\"Let’s collect the loot first.\"\n[Ceasing function.]\n[Ceasing function.]\nLee Shin Woo swung his axe and cleanly broke the golems into pieces. The golems dispersed into several particles of mana and returned to nature. He collected the dropped Perium and Bone Core at the center of where they were, and suddenly surveyed his surroundings. Naturally, he wasn’t able to find anything.\nBut this came out of his vacant mouth.\n\"The connection hadn’t been completely cut.\"\nAt first, the golems had requested for reinforcements, then next attempted to report to command. After that, when none of those had worked, they reported to a figure with the code name A.S. He hypothesized that this A.S. figure was either the one in charge of the golems, or their maker.\nUntil now, he hadn’t gotten any answers from their reports, but he’d finally seen a meaningful response. Though they had received a cold reception and gotten no signal, there was definitely a response given after receiving the report.\n\"But doesn’t the fact that they got no signal mean that the person doesn’t care, even if we assume that there was someone there to receive their report?\"\n\"Well yeah, because he should be undead.\"\nWhile there were golems which were born when minerals were naturally saturated with mana, these golems were clearly artificial. This meant that there was a figure who created these golems and managed them, whether it be the Empire or another individual. Then that figure should obviously be undead by now. And that would explain why the golems ended up being neglected...\n\"I don’t know how the golem’s reporting system works, but if their owner truly is undead, would they really be able to respond this quickly?\"\n\"Not all of the undead are stupid. If we exclude a high leveled undead’s hatred for the living, their intelligence isn’t much different from a living person’s.\"\n\"Seems that way... But if they’re that smart, wouldn’t they have called these golems and used them?\"\n\"...That’s true.\"\nAt that point, they were left in the dark. Lee Shin Woo and Jin stopped acting like Sherlock Holmes, when it didn’t even fit them, and decided to continue doing what they had planned to do. That was to try reinforcing a Bone Core.\n\"Alright. I’ve chosen this one.\"\nLee Shin Woo chose the Bone Core that belonged to the final Bronze Golem, and placed its ’Reinforced Autonomous Defense Type Bone Core’ onto the floor. Seeing that, Jin asked.\n\"You’re not actually going to use all the other Bone Cores on that one, are you?\"\n\"Yeah, I am. There’s not enough information in the Stone Golems’ cores, and they’ve been severely damaged so there’s barely any value to them. Sacrificing them is a much better option.\"\nIt was something he’d roughly been able to figure out as he examined his own mana, and absorbed the cores through Bone Reinforcement. Though it wasn’t possible to understand how the core’s activation mechanism worked indirectly, he was able to figure out a way to approach this directly. Honestly, that was amazing enough.\n\"The Bronze Golems’ cores are in better condition, but if I were to absorb them one by one, it would take a long time to add up all the information together.\"\n\"If you use reinforcement, will you be able to restore the damaged information?\"\n\"In my opinion... yeah. I guess there’s only one way to find out.\"\nIf he was able to restore the information within the Reinforced Autonomous Defense Type Core through reinforcement, he wouldn’t need a lot of them, and he would be able to figure out the secret that these golems held; if he was lucky, he might even be able to figure out the secret behind the code name A.S. too with this one core. At least, that’s what Lee Shin Woo thought.\n\"Then... Bone Reinforcement.\"\nLee Shin Woo executed Bone Reinforcement and used one Bone Core to reinforce the other. Though their levels were different, his skill activated without any problems. It was all fine and dandy until the activation, but...\n[Bone Reinforcement has failed.]\n\"I have a bad feeling about this.\"\n\"No, we can do it. Don’t believe in yourself. Believe in me who believes in you [2].\"\n\"...\"\nHe didn’t know if it was because Jin trusted in Lee Shin Woo, who in turn, trusted in him, but the next attempt succeeded. They rejoiced, but Lee Shin Woo soon assumed a serious expression upon examining the information.\n[Reinforced Autonomous Defense Type Core]\n[Original Core synchronization rate: 13.2%]\n\"I haven’t seen that before.\"\nLee Shin Woo expected for there to be a +1 behind the Bone Core, but he was wrong. Instead, it indicated a synchronization rate with the original core, something that seemed slightly large-scale. It’s likely that if the reinforcement was successful, this value would increase. That’s when Jin asked the key question.\n\"What about the amount of information?\"\n\"Hmm... It’s been restored.\"\nIt was only a small amount, but a portion of the damaged area was indeed recognizable again.\nIf he were to say how much, it was like when he was confused about the difference between two homonyms in a sentence before, and now he was sure which was which as it was such a strange difference between them [3]. In any case, what’s important was that he was able to restore some of the information.\nMaybe the original core would appear if he completely restored the core?\n’Though I don’t really need to know what the original core is...’\nAt the very least, he was sure that he was going in the right direction. In order to more thoroughly investigate the change in the synchronization rate, Lee Shin Woo gripped the Bone Core and continuously used Bone Reinforcement. A blinding light arose.\n[Bone Reinforcement has failed.]\n[Bone Reinforcement has failed.]\n[Bone Reinforcement has succeeded.]\n[Original Core synchronization rate: 13.4%]\n\"What!\"\nOne successful reinforcement resulted in a 0.2% increase? He had 310 more Autonomous Defense Type Bone Cores, and a bit more than 100 Reinforced Autonomous Defense Type Bone Cores. It would be a relief if the Reinforced Autonomous Defense Type Bone Cores had a high synchronization rate, but it they didn’t, he might go broke before he even attempted to use them.\n\"Ugh... Damn it, I’ll go for it regardless!\"\n\"See, I told you you’d feel anxious.\"\n\"No, I believe in you. I believe in you who believes in me!\"\n\"You know, I think there’s a final version to that. Something like ’believe in the you who believes in yourself’.\"\n\"Damn it. I really wanted to say that one...!\"\nIt was too late to back out now. If he failed to restore the core, then he’d have no choice but to leave this place and give up!\nWith a heart of iron and blood, Lee Shin Woo prepared himself to lose everything and continued with the reinforcement. Because he had used Bone Reinforcement a countless number of times, its speed was at least reliable.\n[Bone Reinforcement has failed.]\n[Bone Reinforcement has succeed...]\n[Fail...]\n[Fail...]\n[Succeed...]\nThat’s how more than 310 Bone Cores, as well as the Reinforced Bone Cores became scarce. In their place was a single Bone Core that seemed to weakly radiate light, but he might’ve been imagining things.\n[Reinforced Autonomous Defense Type Bone Core]\n[Synchronization Rate: 99.9%]\n\"Why the hell did it have to be 0.1%? There aren’t even any golems left!\"\n\"No, it’s fine.\"\n\"Can you use other bone equipment to reinforce it by any chance?\"\nJin asked reasonably and Lee Shin Woo firmly shook his head.\n\"Cores can only be reinforced with other cores. Probably.\"\n\"Get straight to the point.\"\n\"I’m saying that the reinforcement’s already finished.\"\nLee Shin Woo propped up the core, which he’d completed by using most of the golems’ cores in the highlands, with both hands. Now, Jin could see it too. The geometrical pattern that covered the Bone Core.\n\"But I can’t tell what it says at all.\"\n\"Hmm, I’m sure.\"\n\"You’re really pissing me off...\"\nIf Lee Shin Woo hadn’t absorbed a few Bone Cores prior to this, he wouldn’t have been able to make sense of it either.\nHowever, in the process of repeatedly utilizing Bone Reinforcement, he meticulously examined the restored patterns, and analyzed the mutual exchange of mana amongst them; now that the core was finished, he knew. What state the Bone Core was in, and what kind of item this restored core was.\n\"Hoo...\"\nHe calmly gripped the core and emitted his mana. The mana saturating his body flowed and wrapped around the core. The core, which emitted a delicate golden light, was soon dyed completely in a reddish mana; now that he thought about it, once he hit level 4, his mana had changed into a dark red light.\n[The Bone Original Core has been completed. You require more materials to manufacture golems. You can analyze the core in order to figure out what materials you need.]\n\"Heut...\"\nA smile naturally formed on Lee Shin Woo’s face. Jin was relayed the message through their contract and spoke with a disbelieving look.\n\"You can make golems with that?\"\n\"Yeah. Though I’ll need a lot more stuff in the future, that information’s also stored inside the core. Everything regarding the golems is assembled inside the core, so I know where they were originally made, what additional materials I need to make them, as well as what characteristics and types there are.\"\n\"Oh... I really have no idea what you’re talking about.\"\n\"I’m saying that if I just absorb this core, I can learn about the golems here, as well as all the information regarding them. Think it is as their place of origin.\"\n\"Oh!... Huh?\"\nAs expected, it seemed like Jin wasn’t very bright as he was naturally talented in sprinting; therefore, Lee Shin Woo gave up on getting him to understand, and gripped the bone core one more time.\nOriginally, it was probably a core used to manufacture powerful golems, but to him, it was just an appetizing wonder drug. This was the fruit of high level Magic Engineering that contained the method of controlling golems, as well as the corresponding information on golems neatly organized within!\n\"Bone Reinforcement!\"\n[By consuming the Bone Original Core, your entire body is reinforced. All stats have increased by 10. Acquiring all the information and memories within.]\nAt that moment, a tremendous amount of information pushed into his brain, causing him to fall to his knees.\nIt wasn’t even like this when he acquired the Weapon Trickster’s Arm Bone. It was also different from when he absorbed Gerrit’s bone. He just couldn’t accept the tremendous amount of information that came rushing at him all at once.\n’The way to control a golem. The way to control a golem. The way a golem attacks. The way a golem attacks. The way to gather and release mana. If I just follow this as is, I could become a golem myself...’\nOf course, that should be impossible, but just by understanding the fundamental ways by which a high leveled golem moved, Lee Shin Woo’s knowledge of magic and martial arts skyrocketed.\nHe was able to make it this far with his numerous skills and his genius, but the areas where he’d lacked in refinement were supplemented systematically by his Mana Bone skill, and he’d relied on the combat knowledge he’d gathered as well as Bursting Thunder technique to correct his bearing and stance. And the result of that appeared instantly. Chapters fırst released on novel★fire.net\n[The Low Rank Mana Bone skill has become Lv9. Magic has increased by 5. You can draw out your mana more effectively.]\n[The Low Rank Bursting Thunder skill has become Lv9. Strength and Magic have increased by 3. It seems you’ve gained a vague understanding of how to call down lightning upon your weapon.]\nTruthfully, when Lee Shin Woo was abruptly dragged into another world and brought into the Underground Empire just a short while ago, he had caught onto the basics faster than the other heroes. It was only natural, since he absorbed the knowledge and experiences of the undead who’d already possessed these fundamentals.\nHowever, he couldn’t give himself a perfect score. Since most of the enemies he’d fought were low leveled undead. However, that changed when he absorbed the Bone Original Core.\n[The Low Rank Stealth skill has become Lv8. Agility has increased by 7. You can now hide your movements more naturally than before.]\n[The Intermediate Combat Sense skill has become Lv2. Agility has increased by 5. Your dynamic visual acuity has grown.]\nHe possessed an exemplary balance that he couldn’t even find in the many individuals in his memories, as well as the know-how of how to handle magic. While it seemed like that’s all that happened, most of his skills had also increased in level. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that he went through an overwhelming growth the moment he got a handle on the basics.\n[Using this core to make a mass produced type golem? What a waste.]\n\"Ugh...!?\"\nHowever, that wasn’t the end of it. He accepted all the information regarding the golems, and the panting Lee Shin Woo came to the second wave of information. It was a memory detailing the instant the Original Core was born.\n[The copies of the core are deteriorating... Hmm, it might be possible with that.]\n[Do we really have to go this far? I don’t think we really need to hide our identities.]\nIt’s impossible for the egoless core to possess memories, but as he raised his level, as well as the level of his Bone Reinforcement, Lee Shin Woo was ultimately able to see the memories of related individuals as well!\n[This is all for the Empire.]\n[Arema. Arema Steelworker! We have all gathered under your name!]\n[We are...]\n[We are! The best of the Empire!]\n[...Since that’s the duty we’ve been given.]\nSeveral individuals’ fragmented memories brushed past his brain.

Lee Shin Woo!\"\n\"Bleh...\"\nHe knew nothing would come out, even if he vomited, yet he still attempted to do so, and roughly breathed out. It was something he retained from his days as a human being. Repeatedly doing so calmed him down and was certainly effective, though it could just be a placebo.\n\"Get a hold of yourself, Shin Woo!\"\n\"I’m ok. There was way too much information coming in all at once. Which means that it was also that helpful to me as well.\"\nLee Shin Woo raised his front foot, slightly pushed aside Jin, who had been hitting him wildly, and replied. Then, the seemingly dissatisfied Jin scrapped the floor and spoke harshly.\n\"It’d be great if I could make one for you as well.\"\n\"You want to give me something like that; when it was even difficult for you to absorb!? Are you crazy?\"\n\"Nope. You probably won’t be able to absorb the memories, so don’t worry. It’ll be helpful enough if you just learn the fundamental principle behind how the golems use mana, as well as how their body operates.\"\nThis was especially important for Jin, as he didn’t even know the basics behind mana usage; therefore, it would be even more helpful to Jin. Hearing that, the goblin fire in Jin’s eyes spun around, and he felt like he was at a loss, but he soon calmed soon. Because he realized the reality of his situation.\n\"But there aren’t any more golems in the entire area, so there’s nothing we can do. I really want to get stronger too, but it can’t be helped since there aren’t any golems left that can drop cores.\"\n\"Haha. So you’re saying that if we can somehow get those cores, you’re willing to accept it?\"\n\"Well, yeah. But there aren’t any. ...Right?\"\nHearing Lee Shin Woo’s laughter, Jin suddenly felt anxious and replied timidly. Lee Shin Woo was smiling. The red light of his mana appeared in the palm of his outstretched hand, developing into a peculiar pattern. It was none other than the pattern that had been inscribed onto the Original Core.\n\"Please say it’s not.\"\n\"Why do you think so many golems were here? There are two possible causes. First, this was the golems’ ’destination’.\"\n\"Aw...\"\nWith just that one line, Jin figured it out. The next moment, the entire area seemed to resonate with the seal, composed of mana and created by Lee Shin Woo... But to be exact, the center of the highlands began to tremble.\nA gold circle appeared atop the ground, and the party of two entered inside the circle. Though they weren’t even connected, Jin was able to tell what Lee Shin Woo intended.\n\"Then is this by any chance a ’production site’ for the golems...?’\n\"Yeah, you’re right. If you go below here, shouldn’t there be some more golems remaining? The golems that were trapped inside, following the Empire’s collapse...\"\nLee Shin Woo rode atop Jin and the area within the golden circle began to sink into the floor. It felt as though they were on an elevator going down to a secret base. The seal atop Lee Shin Woo’s hand was slowly rotating.\nJin thought it looked like a magic circle seen in fantasy movies and asked.\n\"Did you get a permit? Like in a dungeon?\"\n\"I reverse operated the Original Core’s code, and attained the rights of a general administrator. But the owner should still have the director’s rights, so I shouldn’t be able to steal it.\"\n\"Ooh...\" Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs novel⦿fire.net\nAs always, Jin wasn’t able to understand him, but nonetheless agreed enthusiastically. As expected, he’d thought that Jin wouldn’t be able to understand the natural sciences, but Lee Shin Woo was honestly a liberal arts major as well. Fortunately, calculating the composition of mana didn’t rely on arithmetic skills, but on intuition and logical reasoning.\n\"But how far is this thing going to go down?\"\n\"Since our senior heroes dug as much as they could and still weren’t able to reach it, it probably means that this thing goes really deep underground.\"\nThis entire empire was constructed underground, yet they had to go further underground? Now he could understand why the entrance was in the highlands. The more he thought about it, the less he could comprehend the scale of the Underground Empire, and just laughed bitterly.\n\"Ah, look. The ceiling’s closing.\"\nThe ceiling plugged up, like a container being closed. In an instant, everywhere became dark, but due to the blazing goblin fire in their eye sockets, they could tell where the other was.\nThough it was cool, wouldn’t it be useless when trying to move stealthily in the dark? Lee Shin Woo suddenly had that concern.\n\"I should practice turning off the goblin fire.\"\n\"Your imagination’s frightening... By the way, I followed you down here, but wouldn’t the director be down here?\"\n\"They could.\"\nLee Shin Woo affirmed unimportantly, and Jin narrowed his eyes.\n\"Then it’s dangerous!\"\n\"It’s always been dangerous for me. This time is no different.\"\nLee Shin Woo acknowledged Jin calmly and then said.\n\"But if we overcome that danger, we can grow tremendously. That’s our advantage over the other heroes. Not the fact that we have multiple lives, but the fact that because of those lives, we can attempt things that are dangerous to others even just one more time.\"\n\"That’s... true.\"\n\"If need be, I’ll give up a life and we can just run away. Though I’d gain as much as I’d lose on the way out no matter what.\"\nJin marveled at Lee Shin Woo’s statement. It was amazing that Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t hesitate to stake his life and would stubbornly struggle in those situations where he might die, yet had survived up until now without losing many lives.\nIf he had 97 remaining lives like him, Jin felt as though he’d become lax; but on the contrary, Lee Shin Woo was much more guarded. He really had a frightening tenacity and state of mind.\n\"We’ve arrived.\"\nTheir descent came to a complete stop, and the slight tremors ceased. It was still dark everywhere, but Lee Shin Woo could sense that there was a passageway that stretched far ahead. As well as the golems that filled it, too.\n[Detected a trespasser.]\n[Confirmed a general administrator’s seal.]\n[On standby.]\nThe golems activated instantly, emitting a screeching noise, but ceased their movements immediately after, once they recognized the seal floating atop the palm of his hand.\nJin marveled at the sight, but Lee Shin Woo suddenly gripped the seal tightly and contorted it. At that moment, the golems’ attitude changed completely.\n[Detected a trespasser.]\n[Blocking intrusion into the production base.]\n\"Hey!\"\nThey could’ve gone through this in a relaxed manner, yet why is he making things so difficult!? Jin yelled in astonishment, but Lee Shin Woo replied calmly.\n\"We won’t be able to grow at all if we just go through it like this. I thought I could at least improve my Acting skill, but it would be pointless against golems which don’t even have an ego.\"\n\"You dumbass... they’re coming!\"\n[Beginning attack.]\nSomething flashed in the darkness; the closest golem had swung its greatsword!\n[Lv4 Bronze Sword Golem]\nThe instant Lee Shin Woo dodged its attack, he confirmed that there were greatswords attached to where its arms should’ve been. They were different from the golems above! They were probably stronger, too!\n[Entry failed. On standby.]\n[Attack failed. Resuming attack.]\n\"Hmm...?\"\nUnfortunately, the passageway was so narrow that he couldn’t fight them all at once, despite the sense of danger they gave off. The golem’s greatsword got stuck into the wall, and it did its best to remove it.\nSeeing that stupid golem, Lee Shin Woo thought there’d be no way to train his skills, regardless of whether they were hostile to him or not.\n\"Then... go ahead and try fighting them yourself, Jin.\"\n\"But they look stronger than the Bronze Golems up top!\"\n\"You have an absolute advantage here with your high agility. Just try it out!\"\nHe said as he pushed Jin from behind. At that moment, the golem succeeded in pulling out its greatsword and continued with its second attack. Jin was startled and moved his body, successfully evading the attack.\n\"Hey!\"\n\"Good luck!\"\n\"Eeeeek....!\"\nEven as he grited his teeth, Jin activated Steel Body. His body became as tough and sharp as steel; it was an extremely useful skill which simultaneously made his body into both a shield and a sword.\nImmediately after, Jin forcefully struck the flustered golem, as its greatsword was stuck in the ground, with his front legs. It was an attack that simultaneously propelled his body forward with his hind legs and struck with the weight of his front legs!\n[Critical Hit!]\n[Confirming critical damage. Retreating for repairs.]\n[Confirming target’s survival. Switching out.]\nSince his agility was so high, there was a frightening force behind his attack with just the simple motion of pushing his body forward. To the point that he was able to inflict critical damage onto a level 4 golem!\nBefore, this kind of attack would’ve been overwhelmingly burdensome on Jin’s body, but here Steel Body exhibited its usefulness. It would temporary rid him of his knee joints and transform both his front legs into a substance akin to steel, which simultaneously reduced the burden on Jin and strengthened his attack.\n\"Oh. Why are they so weak?\"\n\"As I thought, you can do it if you try. Now we just need to keep fighting and practice so that you keep attacking with that force.\"\n\"Ugh!\"\nJin didn’t even have the opportunity to respond and hectically moved his body. That’s because as soon as he finished off the golem attempting to retreat and its body had disappeared, he had to dodge the incoming spear strike from another golem.\n’It’s not like he doesn’t have the talent. Since he’s so fundamentally nimble.’\nLee Shin Woo watched Jin’s struggle and nodded his head. If one’s agility was high, their ability to respond to external stimuli would increase, though unfortunately Lee Shin Woo couldn’t give him any advice in terms of his movements.\nThe problem was that Jin would feel uneasy whenever his enemy attacked him; however, he saw that Jin was gradually becoming better in that regard. If something went wrong, Jin’s attack, infused with his high agility, might be even more powerful than Lee Shin Woo’s own. Lee Shin Woo felt slightly happy.\n[Ceasing function.]\n[Ceasing function.]\n\"Don’t be careless. There’re guys up above.\"\n\"I see them!\"\nCompared to Lee Shin Woo, Jin was slower at clearing them, but he was still plenty fast. He quickly cleaned up the golems and gradually cleared up the passageway. He fought intense battles against the golems (though, of course, the golems were huge and the weapons they wielded were likewise large, so they were at an overwhelming disadvantage) and Lee Shin Woo could see his movements improving by the minute.\nLee Shin Woo picked up the cores and the Perium, and relaxingly followed behind him. Then, when he confirmed that Jin wouldn’t have any trouble taking down the golems by himself, he earnestly began examining the core’s information.\n[Reinforced Attack Type Bone Core]\n[Original Core Synchronization Rate: 17%]\n\"Ah, so that’s why.\"\nThe difference between the golems up top and the ones below was clear. Compared to the ones up top who protected their stations and were charged with defense, the golems trapped in here were mostly focused on offense. Thus, they were fitted with weapons like greatswords or spears, but they were comparatively weaker in defense.\n’Whether it’s the Autonomous Defense Type Core, or the Attack Type Core, their original form was the Original Core, so I don’t really need them.’\nThe Autonomous Defense Type Cores and the Attack Type Cores were mass produced versions of the Original Core. Lee Shin Woo, who had already absorbed the Original Core, didn’t feel like he needed them. Truthfully, Lee Shin Woo was able to easily look into the information of the Attack Type Cores, even though the synchronization rate was only at 17%.\n[Ceasing function.]\n[Ceasing function...]\n\"Euap!\"\n\"Yeah, actually I do need it.\"\nDespite him fighting impressively, Jin still had spots where he was lacking, so Lee Shin Woo shook his head and began to reinforce a core in earnest. Since they were all reinforced cores, one successful reinforcement would increase the synchronization rate by 1.5%, and if he was lucky, it would be increase it by 2%.\n[The Bone Original Core has been completed. You need more materials to manufacture golems. You can analyze the core in order to figure out what materials you need.]\nAs they diligently passed through the passageway, he would absorb the cores from the fallen golems, and completed another Original Core.\n\"Be happy, Jin. Now you’ll be able to learn the fundamentals of combat and magic...\"\n\"Shin Woo!\"\n\"Uh... Huh?\"\nHearing Jin urgently call for him, Lee Shin Woo, who was about to pass him the Original Core, stopped, raised his head, and looked forward.\nThere was an object made of iron in front of him, something he’d seen many times before coming to the Empire. It was extremely large and long, with compartments and doors. That object which sat on tracks in front of them was...\n\"It’s a train...\"\n\"Isn’t that a train...?\"\nLee Shin Woo and Jin simultaneously muttered, raised their heads, and looked at each other.\nThey were sure of one thing. The two had discovered a secret that no other hero before them had found.",

    "content": "<Chapter 13. Arema Steelworker - 3>\n\"So this Empire had trains as well, huh.\"\n\"More importantly, your world had trains too?\"\n\"It was a place called Earth. Contrary to the Empire, there were several continents on the planet, and there were several nations on those continents... I came from a country called the United Kingdom.\"\n\"I see. I’ll remember that.\"\nJin carelessly disclosed where he was born. Lee Shin Woo wasn’t very surprised. Since he had figured out that their civilizations were roughly the same as they talked to each other.\nEspecially since the name of their planets was the same; it was highly likely that their planets only differed nominally. But what was most important is that confirming that fact was difficult. Because of that, he couldn’t add anything to the conversation. However, it seems like Jin thought differently.\n\"Were you born on Earth as well, by any chance?\"\n\"Why’s that important now?\"\n\"Well, it just feels different, you know?\"\n\"There’s no reason to look into things like that. It isn’t the name of the planet we’re from that’s of greatest importance, but the train right in front of us.\"\nLee Shin Woo meticulously surveyed his surroundings, rather than hastily looking inside the train. Though the passageway had been filled to the brim with golems, when they had gotten outside of said passageway and arrived at this clearing, there was nothing here.\nTo be exact, aside from the train with its opened door, as well as the tracks that it ran on, there was nothing else in the vast clearing. It was to the point that they believed that this underground clearing was designed for the sole purpose of running this train.\n\"Where does this go... I probably won’t be able to tell.\"\n\"The only thing I’m sure about is that it’s really long.\"\nJin pushed his head forward, examined the continuing railway, and was astonished. Meanwhile, Lee Shin Woo exercised his rights as a general administrator again to access the train, but there wasn’t really any information he could gain from doing so. Get full chapters from novel{f}ire.net\nBut there was one thing he did change; it was the reactivation of the train that had long since been silent. Of course, that wasn’t his intent.\n[The train will depart in three minutes.]\nA voice rang out from the train itself. It was then that Lee Shin Woo realized that this lump of iron that resembled a train was also a golem. He didn’t know who made it, but they had to be damn smart!\n\"Try stopping it for now, Shin Woo. Shouldn’t we know more about it before getting on?’\n\"Well, I can turn this thing on, but I can’t turn it off.\"\n\"What are you...\"\n\"Let’s get on. It feels like a waste to just let it go.\"\nJin just gaped at Lee Shin Woo’s recklessness. However, it was true that there was nothing else they could gain from this space, and he was also curious about what lay at the end of the railway.\n\"Alright, let’s get on.\"\nThe body of the train, as well as the door, was huge. He could easily guess as to why. This was a freight train designed to load golems onto it. Lee Shin Woo’s guess just a short while ago was a bit off. This wasn’t a production area for golems, it was the first place the golems were delivered to!\n\"If that’s the case, then the golems that our seniors found in other areas were...\"\n\"We can assume that there were trains like this one there too. No, that’s not the issue here.\"\nIf they were lucky, they might be able to use this train to go to those areas as well! They could explore every nook and cranny of the Empire with this train!\n\"But if something goes wrong, we could be dumped into the wrong place and get ourselves killed.\"\n\"Could you not say something so ominous...?\"\nThe two entered the train and examined the interior, but the only thing they could discover was traces that this train was once a place that transported golems. Then again, it wasn’t likely that it would tell thieves like them where the next station was.\n\"Oh, it’s departing.\"\n\"Seems that... ugh!\"\nThe moment the train door closed, the train began driving at a crazy speed. He didn’t know what kind of magic was set-up on the railway or what skill the golem was using, but it was much faster than Jin running at top speed!\n\"Kuhek!\"\n\"Are you alright!?\"\nThe highly agile Jin was able to swiftly regain his balance and took to one side of the train, but Lee Shin Woo flew around the inside of the train and hit the back wall. It was a relief that he was able to use Rule of Bone to reinforce his bones before the collision.\n\"I would’ve died...!\"\nLee Shin Woo gritted his teeth tenaciously at the pain all over his body and kept his balance by gluing himself to one side of the train. If he was not made of bone, he would’ve spilled his guts, as well as his internal organs.\n\"They should’ve announced it. What shitty manners.\"\n\"Can you stand?\"\n\"I can now... somehow.\"\nHow terribly fast did it run? Around the time Lee Shin Woo couldn’t even tell how fast it was going, the train gradually began to slow itself down.\n\"This is...\"\n\"...\"\nIf there was something different about this train compared to one in modern times, it was that this train didn’t have any windows. Lee Shin Woo and Jin just quieted their breathing and stood still within the slowing train.\n[We have arrived at the manufacturing headquarters.]\nThe golem’s characteristically dry voice came out, notifying them that they’d arrived. Lee Shin Woo just flinched again when he heard that they’d come to the manufacturing headquarters.\nHe talked all big about how Jin shouldn’t worry, but he actually couldn’t help but be afraid since he was encountering the unknown. However, he couldn’t just turn back and leave. He carefully stepped away from the wall and stood in front of the door.\n\"For starters, let’s activate the seal.\"\n\"Should I absorb that core, too?\"\n\"No. When you absorb this core, you’ll roll on the floor for roughly thirty minutes while you grunt and groan, so let’s keep that for later.\"\n\"Seriously?\"\nThe door opened. Lee Shin Woo held the seal out, slowly walked out of the train, and surveyed his surroundings. The first thing he saw was another train on the station platform right next to them.\nWhen one enters the large station, they’d be able to see several trains coming and going...\n\"Six, seven, eight... nine. Holy shit.\"\nThere were nine more trains in the station. If they included the train the two rode on, there were ten trains total! Most of the trains came into the station and were on standby, and only the platform on the right end was completely empty.\n\"I’m kind of getting scared here. It’s way bigger than I’d expected...\"\n\"Wait, didn’t you expect that it’d be this big? Even so, it’s just a place that manufactures the golems we just took down. We’re ok.\"\nLee Shin Woo lightly used his Acting skill to conceal his unease from his partner. Jin relied on Lee Shin Woo, so if he ended up seeing how tense Lee Shin Woo was, he’d be dispirited. It seemed as though his bluff was effective, as Jin calmed down a bit as well.\n[Ah, you actually came.]\n\"Gah!?\"\nJin shamefully shrunk back when he heard the sound of an unfamiliar man’s voice from somewhere! He knew they’d be discovered eventually, but he didn’t think they’d be discovered as soon as they arrived... Lee Shin Woo naturally manifested a sword in one hand and put up his guard. However, he couldn’t figure out where the source of the voice came from.\n[No. I’m not going to kill you, so don’t be so tense. If I wanted to kill you, I would’ve killed you earlier. But are you guys really undead?]\n\"Can’t you tell by just looking? We’re just bones.\"\n[True. I only see bones.]\n\"So you’re saying you can see us, huh...\"\nLee Shin Woo realized at that very moment. The man’s voice was coming from the trains everywhere simultaneously. That could mean only one thing: their opponent was someone who had higher authority than Lee Shin Woo.\n[If you were an undead spawned by the Emperor’s curse, then there’s no way you’d be moving so freely; how strange. What exactly are you?]\n\"I have no reason to answer you, but... if I were to tell you one thing, it’s that we weren’t affected by the Emperor’s curse.\"\n[Yeah. It seems that way to me, too. You guys are truly strange. Especially the skeleton horse, who has a clear-cut will and can move on its own; this is the first time I’ve ever seen one like that.]\nSeeing as how he’s speaking like that, the man they were dealing with definitely retained his reasoning and will, and moved accordingly. Lee Shin Woo wanted to ask him about that, but he didn’t hear the man’s voice for quite some time after.\nJin looked at Lee Shin Woo with eyes that seemed to signal that he wanted to immediately go back onto the train and get the hell out of there (the goblin fire that he emitted was quivering and the fact that he was able to interpret the pattern to this degree touched Lee Shin Woo), and Lee Shin Woo also pondered on what he needed to do first to secure a retreat path.\n’That way’s no good, so long as I don’t have the top authority.’\nOtherwise, the highest chance of survival lay in him crushing one of the golems, and them running the opposite way by following the tracks.\nNo matter how far apart their levels were, it would be extremely difficult to follow Jin, who was a horse born for the sole purpose of running. Though their enemy might be able to match his speed temporarily, Jin possessed unlimited stamina as an undead, so they wouldn’t be able to keep up with him!\n[I told you. There’s no need to run away. More importantly, the General said he’d like to meet with you. We won’t hurt you, so won’t you come this way?]\n\"General...?\"\nHearing that, Lee Shin Woo instinctually retorted. Why was it that he was so caught up with the word ’General’? If that General was one of the 12 Generals in the Empire, then would he perhaps be... the missing pieces in his head started to match, and it felt as though fireworks were going off in his head.\n’Is he General Seagald by any chance...!?’\nGeneral Seagald was in charge of the Anti-Skull Project, which attempted to stop the undead curse through the research of several different methods. What if he had been interested in golems, which were artificial life forms immune to the undead curse? And if they prepared for an emergency and created this facility to manufacture golems, then...!\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\"...I want to meet him at least once.\"\n\"As I thought...\"\nHe had gone this far, so he couldn’t back down now. However, he didn’t blindly move while trusting in the man’s promise that they wouldn’t harm them. But, he had a strong hunch that if he backed out now, he wouldn’t be able to come back here again.\n\"If we’re unlucky, I might die not once, but several times. You stay put, but if it seems like things are going south, break one of these trains, follow the tracks, and go back. Since I’ll come join you later.\"\n\"No. I want to meet him too. You told me how you had gotten stronger before, remember? Moreover, it’ll be better if I’m there if we’re faced with a situation where we have to run away.\"\n\"You...\"\nIt really was a response befitting an undead; he was unwilling to stay out of it. Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly, and nodded his head.\nHonestly, if things didn’t go as planned, it wasn’t as though he didn’t have skills to protect him. That skill was none other than the Sacrifice skill.\n[Sacrifice Lv1 (Active)]\n[You can activate this skill when someone else is about to die. You save the target’s life in exchange for your own. The user will die without fail.]\n’Though I’d like it if I didn’t have to use it.’\nWhen he had first received the Savior karma token, as well as this skill, he’d thought it was a useless skill that just came along with a half-assed karma. Thinking, ’what kind of useless skill is this? I sacrifice my life to save only one other person?’.\nHowever, it wasn’t a useless skill for Lee Shin Woo. Why? Because Lee Shin Woo had 97 lives remaining, that’s why. He certainly couldn’t use the skill recklessly, but he could use for his partner, who more than doubled his fighting strength.\n[Good. Come this way.]\nThey went to the stairway beyond the wide platform, and the door above opened automatically. He wondered what he’d do if there were several golems in there, but... there weren’t.\n[Welcome, Undead. Even if you go crazy, please don’t attack me.]\nThere, a colossal, burly golem stood awaiting them.\n[Since I’m not alive. Understand?]\nWith mana more powerful than anyone he’d ever met before.\n[Lv7 Golem Ark Knight - Guillotine Steelworker]\nA golem.",

    "content": "<Chapter 13. Arema Steelworker - 4>\n\"A golem...?\"\nLee Shin Woo muttered as he saw the message informing them of the identity of the titan before them. He expected him to be an undead that hadn’t lost its reasoning, or a human that held out inside of a dungeon so that he could survive, but he hadn’t expected him to be a golem...\n[Of course I am. What else, besides a golem, could retain its sanity within the Empire?]\nThat’s why I’m so interested in you two, the golem added as his eyes lit up. He possessed a human’s eyes, skin, face, and hair; he perfectly resembled a human being, so if Lee Shin Woo hadn’t learned that information from the message, he wouldn’t have known that he was actually a golem.\n[Though I’d like to ask you about your identity right at this very moment... the General would like to see you, so follow me for now.]\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\"...Let’s go.\"\nHe couldn’t precisely ascertain the situation, but there was something that bothered him. It was the fact that the golem’s name was Guillotine ’Steelworker’.\nBased on the memories that dwelled within the Original Core, Arema Steelworker was definitely the director. Was it just coincidence that part of his name was similar to the director’s? Lee Shin Woo thought that wasn’t possible.\n’Then, whether it’s General Seagald or not isn’t the issue here.’\nThe golem bearing the name of Steelworker was a level 7 powerhouse. If that’s the case, then what about the director, Arema Steelworker? He would obviously be an even higher level than the golem... then, wouldn’t he be the general the golem’s talking about? Lee Shin Woo had definitely miscalculated.\n’I didn’t think that golems were making other golems. I didn’t think that, but... if I think that way, it all makes sense. Golems can’t turn into the undead and they shouldn’t die of old age either... But it’s way too surprising that there’s a golem with an innate ego. And a high leveled ego at that.’\n[Don’t mess with the other doors on the way and just follow straight behind me. Since you could set off a trap.]\n\"Ah.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nAround the time that Lee Shin Woo’s head was filled with complications, the golem spoke calmly. Jin, who had been observing the doors that lined the passageway, was shocked and slightly stepped back.\nIt was so huge that it was difficult to take his eyes off it. There were several roads that branched off from the passageway and even those forked roads branched out into several different paths. Jin wouldn’t have known any better, but Lee Shin Woo clearly felt a mass of powerful mana at the end of each of those forked roads.\n’Ha..’\nLee Shin Woo just laughed. It made sense how they threw away level 3 or level 4 golems like they were nothing. It was possible for the contents of any one of these several dozen rooms to be able to take down all of those weak golems that were destroyed by Lee Shin Woo and Jin before.\nIt was possible since they wouldn’t lose anything from neglecting the golems or letting them be destroyed. Lee Shin Woo started to become curious as to what their mission was. But for starters, it did seem like they definitely weren’t on the side of the Imperial Army, which had degenerated into the undead...\n[We’ve arrived.]\n\"It’s a huge door.\"\n[Consider it an honor. It’s not a door that anyone can just enter whenever they wish, aside from the knights that guard the general.]\nThe door lock looked similar to that of the Anti-Skull’s secret facility’s, and when Guillotine Steelworker placed his hand on it, a complex mana seal formed atop his hand and released the locking mechanism.\nLee Shin Woo couldn’t help but be amazed as he saw the door lock and the mana pattern of the seal intersect and delicately, gradually release the lock. It was an interaction that was worlds apart from Anti-Skull’s door lock! It felt like Lee Shin Woo’s mana senses had advanced just by watching the process.\n[Even if you pay such close attention to it, you probably won’t be able to do it yourself so easily. Since it’s something only golems can do. Now, go in. The General’s waiting for you.]\n\"Haha.\"\nFor a golem, he was quick on the uptake. Lee Shin Woo just smiled bitterly, followed behind him, and stepped into the room.\nThe first thing he saw was a huge table. Next was the absurdly high ceiling. Finally, what he saw was...\n[Lv8 Golem Zero - Golden General Arema Steelworker]\nHe was a golem that boasted a height of more than six meters even while sitting down.\n\"Hoh...\"\n\"Ugh.\"\n[How peculiar.]\nThe general remained seated while examining them and then slowly stood up. When Lee Shin Woo saw that the Golden General, Arema Steelworker, almost touched the ceiling at his full height, he was completely overwhelmed.\nHe didn’t match the Lv5 Treasure Eater in terms of size, but the quality and density of his mana was worlds apart. It was to the point that he’d feel bad comparing that dirty caterpillar to him side by side.\n[I don’t feel the curse’s mana from you at all. This space is filled to the brim with the curse, yet I feel like the curse is bouncing off of you. From an undead, who is neither a human nor a golem. ...Who, exactly, are you?]\n\"...\"\nJin was completely terrified by his strength and stiffened in place. On the other hand, Lee Shin Woo remained silent thinking about how he should respond.\nThe golem before him was powerful, and possessed a method of observing the flow of mana that far surpassed Lee Shin Woo’s own. He even contemplated and acted like a human. The fact that he was a golem didn’t matter right now. Lee Shin Woo needed to assume that he was smarter than him in every aspect.\n’Can I just tell him the truth? Even that we’re heroes as well?’\nIf the Golden General was hostile to the undead, it wouldn’t hurt if they told him they were heroes. Since it would confirm that they were both on the same side.\nBut there was too much he didn’t know about them right now. If they don’t understand, they could end up dead and would have just given them unnecessary information. If that’s the case, then first... Lee Shin Woo stuck out his nonexistent tongue, licked his nonexistent lips with saliva he didn’t even have, and opened his mouth.\n\"Do you know... about Anti-Skull?\"\nThis was the start of his lies.\n[Did you volunteer for the Anti-Skull Project? You even know about that?]\nAs he thought, the general knew about Anti-Skull. If he were one of the twelve generals like General Seagald, it wouldn’t be strange if he knew about the Anti-Skull Project, especially if he was a golem that was immune to the curse.\n’But this is a trap.’\nSeeing the golem’s flashing eyes, Lee Shin Woo decided as such. His body movements, as well as his voice were all extremely natural, but he was a golem. From the very beginning, he was suspicious as to whether he actually had a mind or not. It would be the end if he was so easily tricked by his cordial behavior.\n\"It seems like we can cut to the chase since you know about their project. I’d made contact with them in the past, but the place where their experiments took place is far away. We went a different way from them.\"\n[You’ve made contact with them...? Hmm, is that so.]\nThe golem spoke as if he understood and nodded his head. Of course, Lee Shin Woo still wasn’t at ease yet. After all, the general was still suspicious of the two.\nWell, it’s only natural. Since Lee Shin Woo and Jin just popped up several dozens of years after the Empire’s fall. So how could they trust them so easily if they just showed up and said that they were part of some experiment that no one knew about?\n[You’re not one of General Seagald’s men?]\n\"We worked together with one of the men under his command. Thus, we know about the Anti-Skull Project to some extent, and we participated in the plan, but... we’ve never actually met General Seagald before.\"\n[Indeed. It’s not so easy to learn about Anti-Skull. I’m curious as to who that individual was under General Seagald’s command, but... No, it’s fine. Since even I don’t know everything about Seagald right now.]\nHowever, he couldn’t just openly deny him. Because he didn’t have any evidence that actually refuted Lee Shin Woo’s claims. Especially since Lee Shin Woo knew quite a bit regarding the Anti-Skull Project. Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on NoveI★Fire.net\nThe moment one cleverly mixes lies with the truth, one’s words become more persuasive and reassuring. That’s why Lee Shin Woo could stand so proud.\n[The administrator of that project must’ve been someone considerably famous. Since he successfully created undead who could completely resist the curse, or absorb it.]\n\"We’re just lucky. Several people died as well. Though we were a success, we ended up sleeping for dozens of years in exchange.\"\n[I understand. Since that ability couldn’t have appeared if not for your luck that’s close to a miracle from God.]\n\"I agree. It’s only natural that this guy and I were the only successes to the experiment. I lost a lot of memories, a lot of time has passed, and there were several side effects as well, but...\"\nDid they catch on? When he said a ’miracle from God’, Lee Shin Woo momentarily thought as much, yet he responded so naturally, like flowing water. Hearing Lee Shin Woo, Arema Steelworker momentarily hesitated, but soon nodded his head and spoke.\n[I apologize. I was overly suspicious of you and I ended up bringing up some unpleasant memories. We’ll stop the interrogation here. Since we both share a hatred for the curse that fills the Empire.]\n\"Of course. If it weren’t for that curse, I wouldn’t have become like this.\"\n[...Agreed. How unfortunate.]\n’Is this guy also hostile to the undead as well... If that’s true, then should I disclose that I’m a hero? ...No, let’s just leave that out for now. Since it wouldn’t hurt.’\nLee Shin Woo just inwardly nodded in response to Arema Steelworker. He’d figured out the general’s position and had simultaneously managed to hide his own identity. It wasn’t perfect, but the golem was level 8; what’s worse, he was one of the 12 generals of the Empire, so it turned out ok. The moment he thought so, his Acting skill leveled up.\n[You have completely fooled an overwhelmingly higher leveled target. The Acting skill has become Lv8. Your lies become truth until the moment you yourself say otherwise.]\nHowever, that wasn’t all. Lee Shin Woo’s continued to read through the messages that had caused his eyes to open wide.\n[A Joker conceals everything about themselves, and is one who makes false faces. There is no need for there to be a special reason behind your words or actions. That is what it means to be a Joker. All stats have increased by 5. You have fulfilled a part of the conditions to unlock the Joker’s innate skill.]\n’It doesn’t matter whether you have a reason; just lie your way out first... this is my type of skill.’\nIf he were to deceive his opponent first, it would become easier to get out of the situation later, even if things went wrong. Since all he needed to do was to say something else and lie to them again! His normal way of thinking and this karma was a perfect fit.\nIt felt as though he’d found his calling and he seemed pleased, but then, Arema Steelworker moved on to a different topic. This was probably the main topic.\n[I’m more surprised that you were able to acquire the rights of a general administrator than the fact that you guys are undead. It should’ve been impossible even if you were considerably talented...]\n\"I was curious who the owner of all those golems was. I also wanted to know your intentions as well. I was luckily able to make a forgery of it.\"\n[What you did isn’t something you can just pass off as a joke. You should be more confident in yourself. ...More importantly, I want to know what your intentions are. I suppose it’s time for you to ask the questions now, huh?]\n\"There’re just simple questions. After all, you said yourself that we share a hatred for the Empire’s curse.\"\n[Hahaha! Alright, I’ll answer your questions, brave skeleton. Since I have nothing to hide.]\nHearing Lee Shin Woo’s polite and bold statement, the general laughed uproariously. It looked so natural that he could hardly believe that he was a golem.\nImmediately after, something shocking happened. The golem’s body, which was close to 9 meters tall at full height, dwindled in size, and turned into a mere 2 meter tall giant!\n[Most people... even Seagald and Leofield knew this as a giant transformation skill, but it’s not actually that. It’s something that can only be used in the golem high command and is a technique that compresses a golem’s body. Were you surprised?]\n\"Yes...\"\nHe was really surprised. Lee Shin Woo had thought it was only possible because the general was a golem, but there really was a way to turn into a giant! Didn’t that mean that a skill existed in this world that could transform him into a giant? His heart began to pound rapidly.\n[Most of the citizens of the Empire wouldn’t know, but the Golden Army formed by Arema Steelworker was comprised of golems from the very beginning. It was an army created without hesitation to protect the Empire, and in order to create those golems that moved and lived with a clear purpose, we transferred a knight’s consciousness into a core; this is the fruit of our efforts at the end of all those experiments.]\n\"...!?\"\n[Yes. Our goal was different, but we’re both similar aren’t we? We were both sacrificed for our experiments. As a result, we were also able to avoid turning into the undead, so it’s truly ironic, wouldn’t you say?]\nHearing such a shocking story of how the golems came into existence, Lee Shin Woo kept opening and closing his mouth, but then, the Golden General spoke faintly.\n[The day after the curse struck, all the living became undead. However, we, who weren’t of the living any longer, remained.]\nThe core had been engraved with loyalty to the Empire, yet that Empire was now gone, so they hadn’t known what to do.\n[We remained, dozens of years later.]",

    "content": "<Chapter 13. Arema Steelworker - 5>\nFor golems created by humans, loyalty to their master was paramount. The golems were also created for the purpose of protecting the Emperor.\n[However, the Emperor wasn’t satisfied with just ordinary golems. He wanted them to think and move like a normal human being, while also being able to gain karma and grow. Aside from their unwavering loyalty, he wanted every aspect of them to be as close to a human being as possible. Because of that, we began our experiments. To create an absolute fighting force that was loyal only to the Emperor himself...]\nThey sucked the Empire’s precious resources dry, as well as the souls and magic of several young knights, and at the end of all those sacrifices, they succeeded in creating monsters; the Golden Army that originated from the Golden General, Arema Steelworker.\n[There are many who probably don’t know about it. ...We lived much longer than the citizens of the Empire could’ve imagined. But by the time the Emperor, who dreamt of immortality, created us, he was already old and decrepit.]\n\"Ha.\"\nThe knights, whose human souls were combined with a golem’s body, certainly were loyal to the Emperor alone, thought like humans, and were also beings who were capable of growth. Above all, they possessed strong bodies and magic, and were able to survive for such a long length of time. They were the best guards for the Emperor.\n\"The Emperor dreamt of eternal youth and immortality, yet he didn’t think of becoming a golem himself?\"\n[There was a huge problem. Ultimately, we couldn’t achieve a success rate of 100%.]\n\"Ah...\"\nThe Emperor probably couldn’t take that risk. Lee Shin Woo just laughed. He didn’t plan on attempting to seriously verify Arema Steelworker’s claims; but since he’d become so immersed in his interesting story, he naturally became serious about it.\nIt wasn’t his intention, but it had a positive effect on the way Arema Steelworker treated Lee Shin Woo. Though Arema’s face softened only slightly, it was enough.\n[I knew about the Emperor’s desire for immortality, but because I had pledged absolute loyalty to the Emperor, I couldn’t express any opinions regarding it. And ultimately, the day that horrific curse was completed... the Emperor become undead, and we were freed. Since the spell that restricted our free will didn’t factor in the Emperor becoming an undead.]\n\"Then, what did you do after you were freed...?\"\n[I led my subordinates out of the capital and we hid here. The Emperor left me in charge of this place, and it was the only place where we could be safe. The Golem Production Facility.]\nThey hid? That’s what they decided to do once they’d become free of the Emperor’s control? Without even trying to fight once? Lee Shin Woo noticed that the conversation had taken a strange turn. After all, this was a bit different than what he’d envisioned!\n[Aside from us, everyone else became undead, including the other generals who possessed a fighting force equal to mine. I couldn’t win against all of them, and I didn’t want to fight against them either.]\n\"Mm...!\"\nIt was such a weak thing to say, compared to how imposing he seemed when they first met. He wanted to ask if he was weaker than General Seagald by any chance, but now wasn’t the time to provoke him. While he was boiling up on the inside, Arema Steelworker cut in.\n[We’ve lost our purpose. We have nothing left to direct our loyalty to, and just remain idle, slowly losing our free will over the passage of time. We’re just souls who are unable to sleep, and live underground, gradually rusting away.]\n\"Hmm...\"\n[You, the undead who are able to resist the Empire’s curse. I don’t know who you are, or why you decided to bravely come here.]\nAt some point, the conversation was coming to an end. Unexpectedly, Arema commended them, and spoke like this.\n[We’ve lost our wills and we’re just lingering dolls, so just leave us be and go back.]\n\"...\"\nThat’s a lie. Lee Shin Woo was absolutely sure of it when he heard that. He was a way higher level than him, but unfortunately, his acting was much worse than Lee Shin Woo’s.\nIt didn’t matter whether he was a golem or not. It didn’t matter if there were faults in his reasoning or not. His incredible intuition that developed with his Acting skill was telling him this. Arema Steelworker had different intentions, and he didn’t want him to interfere, so he was trying to keep him out in advance!\n\"Not yet.\"\n[Hmm?]\nLee Shin felt like it was time to use his winning move. Right now, concealing his identity or ascertaining their identity wasn’t important compared to this. He decided that he’d extracted all the information he could from them, and that there was still a chance to adjust their relationship!\n\"I have a request.\"\nLee Shin Woo said courageously. As always, Arema Steelworker sported a smile, but he was a golem, so Lee Shin Woo couldn’t trust his expression.\n[I was interested in your ability, so I called you here and spoke to you personally, but I can do nothing more for you. I cannot permit anything else. Go back. The next time you make a copy of that seal and use it to intrude, I won’t just sit by and leave you be.]\n[Alright. If you’re done talking, shall we go?]\nWhen Arema Steelworker finished softly, but firmly, Guillotine Steelworker approached them whilst emitting a turbulent spirit, as though he would execute them if they didn’t listen.\nAll he was doing was emitting mana from his entire body; despite that, Lee Shin Woo felt his body go stiff. He knew that he was no match for him.\n\"I have no intention of...!\"\n[Huh!?]\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo utilized Rule of Bone to its very limit, resisting the pressure, and yelled out. In order to achieve his primary objective of coming here!\n\"I have no intention of stepping into this place, so please allow us to continue using that train! We won’t bother you, and we won’t talk to you. We just want to ride that train to move around. If you allow us to use the train, we’d like some information regarding the destination as well!\"\n[...]\n\"We’re going to take care of the undead in the underground empire, and those trains will be really helpful in doing so. Ah, I’ll also take care of the golems you’re not using, too!]\n[You amazing bastard...]\nThe unexpected request startled Arema Steelworker. Lee Shin Woo acted like he was asking for something trivial, yet it was actually an extremely brazen request; Guillotine Steelworker was astonished that he’d ask for such a thing, and muttered. He may not look it, but he had made the request after planning everything out.\n[You truly are brave. Despite the difference in strength, you...]\n\"That’s exactly why. We’re nothing compared to you, so that’s why we can speak to you like this. Since we’re nobodies to you, and it won’t hurt you to accept a request from some nobodies.\"\n[...]\nRegardless of what Arema Steelworker was thinking about, at the very least, Lee Shin Woo was sure that he was no longer under the Emperor’s command. And though he wasn’t moving proactively, he held no love for the curse that covered the Empire.\nIn addition, Lee Shin Woo’s intuition told him that based on those feelings, he had some kind of secret plan in the works. Figuring out their identity was likely to ascertain whether they would get in the way of said plan.\n\"Like I said, all I want is to be able to use the train!\"\n[Ha...]\nLee Shin Woo was well aware of that, so that’s why he made such a suggestion. He roughly understand their situation, so he asked for a little bit of help, on the condition that they don’t bother them. It wasn’t a bad offer for them either, so he thought they’d have no reason to refuse.\nBut if they did refuse his offer? Then, they would just get the hell out. The idea of ’Try it. You have nothing to lose’ had lead to this situation.\n[General, shall I take care of them?]\n[...No, they’re interesting.]\nThe moment Arema said that, Lee Shin Woo inwardly smiled elatedly. It was exactly the response he’d been hoping for. He’d been acting desperately from the moment they met in order to retain that small ’favorable impression’ that tinged his voice.\n[Fine. Do as he asks. I’ll allow it, on the condition that you not leave the station.]\n\"Thank you very much.\"\n[General...]\n[Guillotine, I’m ordering all the golems including you. From this point on, if those two enter headquarters, kill them without mercy. But if they don’t, don’t touch them.]\n[...I understand.]\nHe seemed dissatisfied, but Guillotine complied obediently and nodded his head. He had no choice but to do so. Based on the flow of mana, it seemed like Guillotine didn’t have any choice in the matter and that Arema was in control.\nWas the reason that a golem could become the master of the other golems due to the unnatural nature at which they lost connection with the original master? There was no way of knowing that right now.\n[I heard a lot from you, but I haven’t heard your name yet.]\nArema Steelworker said. The reason he hadn’t asked for their names was because he didn’t think they’d see each other again. However, the fact that he’d changed his mind and had asked for their names meant that Arema unconsciously thought that ’they might meet each other again’.\n\"My name is Paul Zero.\"\nLee Shin Woo replied in an overwhelmingly confident voice. He felt that it was a relief that they hadn’t spoken each other’s names once since they came here, and he lied in a situation where he didn’t think he would.\n[Paul Zero... I’ll remember that name. Along with your partner, that is.]\n\"You’ll be able to hear about me from various parts of the Empire.\"\n[At the very least, your spirit is impressive. However, the fact that you possess the will to push forward, despite being in an undead body, leaves quite the impression on us. Go as far as you can.]\nHe’d lied until the very end, and the moment he’d successfully tricked Arema, his Acting skill had unexpectedly leveled up again!\n[The Acting skill has become Lv9. Whenever you make a new personality, people suspect you of having multiple personalities.]\nLee Shin Woo remained stiff, even after he’d received permission to use the train, and dragged Jin through the corridor. Guillotine Steelworker sent them off. Perhaps it was because he’d lied so perfectly, but Guillotine didn’t treat Lee Shin Woo too badly.\n[Are there a lot of undead like you outside?]\n\"I’ve met a few of them. They were partial successes from the Anti-Skull Project, though they degenerated into skeletons like me.\"\n[Hoh...]\nHe was instinctively respectful to Arema Steelworker, but spoke comfortably with Guillotine like when they’d first met. It might’ve been because he’d received an order from Arema, but he wasn’t concerned with that.\n[On that day, I saw General Seagald’s form and thought that perhaps... So it really was like that. From the very beginning, that guy was damn impressive...]\n\"As I thought, he maintained his reasoning as well?\"\n[Well, you did say that you were asleep following the experiment, so you’d be unaware of that disastrous day. You’re right. He was fighting against the Emperor even as an undead. I saw him being restrained by the other generals and him leaving the capital. We were able to leave by taking advantage of that commotion.]\nHe’d gotten a hold of some great information! Lee Shin Woo only nodded his head, without getting caught. Around that time, Jin, who’d been ’frozen solid’, slightly bumped Lee Shin Woo with his head. He was timidly complaining that Lee Shin Woo had dragged him all the way here and put him through all that.\n[Huh? Now that I think about it, didn’t this guy talk a lot before?]\n\"He’s too exhausted from putting up with the Golden General.\"\n[Well, it’s true that the General’s magic is considerable. Then how did you endure it? You were also able to obtain the general administrator’s rights, so who exactly are...]\nAt that very moment, the train arrived. Lee Shin Woo saw the door connecting the station platform and the passageway completely close and inwardly, slightly, very slightly, breathed a sigh of relief.\nHe put in a lot of work to get everything to work out, but he couldn’t believe that he’d actually gotten what he wanted. Plus, his Acting skill had even grown! Lee Shin Woo trusted that today’s deceit would bear fruit in the future.\n[Take it. It’s the map for each supply line. You can do as you wish with the abandoned golems there.]\n\"Thanks.\"\nAs expected, he was right; there was a map. From an outside view, it looked to be just an iron plate, but if he displayed the special mana pattern, the map would appear on top of the plate; it was a relief that it was the type of map that he could use with the general administrative rights.\n[Then I’ll get going now. You better keep your promise. Since the General doesn’t lie.]\n\"I don’t lie either.\"\nHe lied up until the very end and his trustworthy expression (his blazing red goblin fire) seemed to satisfy Guillotine, as he nodded his head and went back. Soon, they couldn’t see him as he had gone through the passageway. Of course, this was still their territory, so they couldn’t afford to be reckless.\nWhen the two were left alone, Lee Shin Woo activated the map and picked the place closest to the outskirts of the Empire, aside from where they had been before. That’s because it was the easiest to handle.\n\"Alright. Then shall we go?\"\n\"...I’m not dead yet, right?\" Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs novｅlfire.net\n\"Of course you’re not. We have so many golems left to kill, so you can’t die on me now.\"\n\"You want me to fight again!?\"\n\"Be happy. When we go past there, I’ll give you that (the Bone Original Core).\"\n\"I’m not happy at all, you know!\"\nThe two skeleton heroes unhesitatingly embarked on the train (golem) towards the southern outskirts of the Empire. Like he’d learned from before, he didn’t forget to hold on tight.\nThe train departed right away. And so, Lee Shin Woo began his trip along the Empire’s railway.",

    "content": "<Chapter 13. Arema Steelworker - 6>\nHe didn’t know exactly how far reaching Arema Steelworker’s control over the golems went, but Lee Shin Woo and Jin tacitly agreed that they would be careful with their words and actions within the train.\nIn the middle of the odd silence, the train gradually began to slow down. After that, they received a signal that they’d arrived at their destination. They had really traveled from the west end of the Empire to the south end instantaneously.\n\"Would anyone believe us if we told them?\"\n\"Probably not...\"\nIf all of the heroes were able to use this subway line, the territory of the Empire might change immediately. The system was that revolutionary.\n’Is the Undead Emperor unaware of this facility?’\nIt’s because he was unaware of it that this facility had remained safe all this time. He could tell, through the examination of the Original Core, that Arema Steelworker’s authority in terms of golem manufacturing was extremely high.\nThe Emperor had probably trusted in his absolute loyalty and seemed to have entrusted Arema Steelworker with manufacturing the golems, as well as overseeing all the operations. Back then, he had to have absolute trust in them, as they were under a master-servant relationship.\n\"We’re screwed.\"\nAt that moment, Jin spoke in a slightly trembling voice. The land was teeming with golems beyond the automatically opening door. Considering the fact that they were all level 4 Bronze Golems and were armed with weapons, he could tell that they possessed Attack Type Cores.\nBut Lee Shin Woo had already expected that, so he had activated his general administrator seal.\n[Confirming general administrator.]\n[Welcome.]\nA few of the golems spoke mechanically and greeted them. Lee Shin Woo wondered if he could, so he ordered them to stand in line, but they wouldn’t follow such a detailed order. A general administrative authority only made it so that they ’wouldn’t attack him’, that’s all.\n\"Well, I suppose it can’t be helped. Work hard and get through them. Oh, and make sure you choose the right place.\"\n\"You demon!\"\nLee Shin Woo acted as though he would break apart the seal any minute now, and Jin hastily stepped into the subway train door. He’d desperately moved there to force a 1 on 1 confrontation! Lee Shin Woo, without even giving him any time, erased the seal, and at that very moment, the golems turned their attention to them.\n[Detecting a trespasser. He has infiltrated into a critical facility. Reporting to code name, A.S.]\n[Communication blocked. Assessing the situation. Proceeding to eliminate the trespasser.]\nWhen the golems were blocked by Arema Steelworker, Lee Shin Woo sensed a portion of the flow of mana in the entire area snap. And what did he realize from that? He realized the way in which Arema Steelworker blocked communication with them.\n’He doesn’t block communication with each golem, but blocks communication by region, huh.’\nIn other words, this area was now safe from Arema Steelworker’s gaze. The moment he realized that, Lee Shin Woo recreated the general administrator seal and turned the golems away. Jin’s eyes blazed with indignation, and he turned around and yelled.\n\"Are you training me like a dog!?\"\n\"I have to feed you something tasty before the training starts.\"\n\"Ugh.\"\nJin, seeing the Bone Original Core that Lee Shin Woo had been saving, spoke awfully, as though he’d eaten an entire lemon whole. Lee Shin Woo kindly motioned for him to come over with his hand, and Jin looked as though he was a criminal being offered poison, as he slowly walked over.\n\"But can you take that out now?\"\n\"The connection’s been completely cut in this region. We can talk comfortably now.\"\n\"Really? By the way, Lee Shin Woo. How the hell were you able to stand in front of a level 8 golem and lie without even blinking!? He was a level 8 golem!\"\nThat was probably something he’d really wanted to say. He was more shocked than awed by what he had seen. Lee Shin Woo just chuckled and replied.\n\"Who cares? They lied to me too. They definitely oppose the Emperor, but don’t trust anything other than that.\"\n\"Really!? They sounded like they were going to cry...!\"\n\"Anyone can make something like that up.\"\nIt seemed as though Jin had taken everything that they’d said as the truth. Lee Shin Woo looked at him pitifully, and then Jin put great effort into turning his head and spoke as if he were justifying himself.\n\"We aren’t enemies, so it didn’t seem like there was any reason to lie to each other...\"\n\"There are things you have to keep from your allies as well. And though we have a common enemy, there’s no guarantee that they’re not our enemies as well.\"\n\"You sure spoke bravely to that golem.\"\n\"Since our growth is a pressing matter. Moreover, I was able to say that to him because he doesn’t know how fast our growth is.\"\nHe replied calmly, and continued on.\n\"In any case, we got everything we wanted; maybe even more.\" The source of this content ɪs NoveI[F]ire.net\n\"A way to contact them.\"\nThey said they’d only use the train, but as they come and go, the golems would inevitably take an interest in them again. Arema Steelworker knew that as well.\nLee Shin Woo’s final goal was to constantly use the train, give them a strong impression, gain their trust, and ultimately, forge a deep connection with them. If it’s possible, a contract with them as well. Hearing that, Jin was frightened and replied.\n\"In other words, doesn’t that mean that we’ll remain visible to them, and they’ll be watching us?\"\n\"Life is like that. Isn’t it a worthwhile risk?\"\n\"You’re really bold, aren’t you...\"\n\"If I wasn’t, I wouldn’t be able to act. Hurry up and come over here.\"\n\"Damn it. I hate things that hurt.\"\nLee Shin Woo had his fill of Jin’s admiring gaze and placed the Bone Original Core atop Jin’s forehead. And like an oral surgeon about to perform root canal surgery on a patient, he lied gently.\n\"If it hurts, just say so. Bone Reinforcement!\"\n\"Ughhhhhhhhhh!\"\nOf course, there was nothing he could do, even if Jin said that it hurt. All he could do was place a hand on Jin’s back, share the pain through their connection, and help him to fully absorb the core. Since he’d already absorbed the core once before, it was quite easily for him.\n[Strength has increased by 2, and Magic by 3.]\n\"What a gold mine.\"\nThough he’d already absorbed the information from the Original Core, there was quite a bit of newfound memories remaining within.\n[You cockroaches. Why don’t you just give up?]\n[Our duty is one of honor. It’s all for the sake of the Emperor.]\n\"Hoo.\"\n\"Gahhhhhhhhh.\"\nLee Shin Woo shouldered all of the memories that Jin couldn’t handle, and the massive quantity of mana knowledge, as well as the method to harmonize the body and mana were poured into Jin.\nIt was ridiculously easier than when he’d absorbed the core, but it seemed as though even this was difficult for Jin as he had gritted his teeth.\n\"It hurts! Just a little... Just a little slower!\"\n\"If I slow it down any further, you’ll lose all the memories. It’ll be tough, but endure it just a little while longer.\"\nAs expected, even if he told him it hurt, there wasn’t anything he could do about it. He should’ve known since he’s been to a dentist before! Tears flowed from his eyes at Lee Shin Woo’s betrayal as all the information from the core was being shoved into his brain. It had taken less than five minutes, yet it had felt like an eternity to him.\n\"Ugh, ugh...\"\n\"You alright?\"\n\"I’m not ok.\"\nAfter he had finished completely absorbing the core, Jin gasped like Lee Shin Woo had, even though nothing came out, and gritted his teeth. Lee Shin Woo asked gently.\n\"How much did your stats increase?\"\n\"Strength by 9, agility by 15, health by 7, and magic by 13... Plus, most of my skills increased by 2 or 3 levels each...\"\n\"It was good that you absorbed it, right?\"\n\"Yeah. Damn it...\"\nEven if he considered that Jin’s agility increased by a factor of three, it was a ridiculous increase in stats. The Original Core really was a gold mine.\nOf course, the more he absorbed it, the less its effects would be, but it certainly remained an attractive material nonetheless. Lee Shin Woo inspected the outside, filled to the brim with golems, and spoke excitedly.\n\"By the time we’ve gone to all the points on the map, we should both be level 5.\"\n\"I’m not going to go through Bone Reinforcement for another month.\"\n\"Shouldn’t we shoot for level 6 in a month?\"\n\"No, you demon!\"\nHow much information could there have been for Jin to still be unable to steady himself and totter around? Lee Shin Woo knew what to do in this situation.\n\"Now, go out and fight.\"\n\"You really are a demon!\"\n\"The information in your head hasn’t been fully organized yet, so you should gradually adapt to the knowledge and experiences by actually using them in the field. I’ve already gone through this before, so just listen to me.\"\n\"Ugh...\"\nFinding no alternative, Jin followed Lee Shin Woo’s orders to the letter. Whenever the seal stopped radiating light, the golems would emit a mechanical sound, and come rushing over to them from all over! But at the very least, there weren’t any golems equipped with long distance weapons!\n[Repelling trespasser.]\n[Aiding. The space is narrow and we cannot afford to damage the critical facility. Standing by.]\n\"Steel Body!\"\nCountless golems swarmed them! Jin, who fought them off, instinctively activated Steel Body. His body was reinforced much faster and much more naturally than before he absorbed the Bone Original Core!\n\"Heuaap!\"\n\"Ooh.\"\nJin instinctually kicked the front golem and stepped on it; then, he turned his body around, and swept away the golems in the front with his hind legs in a single stroke. Through Steel Body, his hind legs were strengthened such that they were as sharp and heavy as an axe and all the golems were blown back with one kick!\n\"Good, you’re doing well! Now you can take on a majority of the golems here!\"\n\"Eugeuaaaaa!\"\nJin used Lee Shin Woo’s cheers as fuel for his anger, and went on a rampage! What’s worse is that even as he fought, he realized that Lee Shin Woo was right about the accumulated knowledge, and got even more pissed off!\nOn the other hand, Lee Shin Woo marveled at Jin’s fundamental change within such a short period of time, especially when concerning his movements in combat.\n’Oh, he’s doing much better than I’d expected.’\nJin wasn’t originally this talented, but after establishing a contract with Lee Shin Woo, continuously maintaining a connection with Lee Shin Woo, and being thrust into every kind of situation, he had surpassed his limitations. It was miraculous growth that came about due to their contract!\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t even aware of that; instead, he just figured that since Jin was more skilled than he’d expected, he wickedly thought that he’d be able to push him even more from now on.\n\"Hoo, Hooo...\"\nIt’d been 10 minutes since Jin had improved his combat abilities, and eventually, when his Steel Body skill leveled up once more, his front legs had at last touched the ground. There were no longer any enemies left.\n\"Hey... I took down all of the golems!\"\n\"Wow, there were at least fifty of them. Nice job.\"\n\"I really want to kill you right now.\"\n\"I could die for you at least once. I would have 96 lives left then.\"\nLee Shin Woo calmly responded and collected the loot; after that, he applied bone powder on the cracked and cut areas on Jin’s body, as if he were rubbing an ointment, and activated Bone Reinforcement. Jin twisted his body as if it had felt itchy.\n\"A lot of Perium came out, but there’re a lot of cores, too. There are 52 Attack Type Cores...\"\n\"Can you complete one core with just that many?’\n\"The problem is that we have to be lucky with this.\"\nHe’d already figured out the composition of the Original Core, but combining the cores to create another Original Core was a different issue entirely. The purpose of reinforcing the core wasn’t to match the dislocated sections, but to restore the fundamentally lost sections by combining two cores with similar characteristics. Naturally, there was a failure rate as well.\n\"But it’s fine. Since there should be a lot of them still out there.\"\n\"Some of them should’ve been taken care of by the other heroes.\"\n\"That’s bad luck. Don’t say stuff like that.\"\nLee Shin Woo scolded Jin, who’d said something that might bring misfortune, and lead him out of the passageway. He maintained the general administrative seal with one of his hands, and Jin, who was suddenly doubtful of his actions, asked.\n\"Why do you keep creating the seal and then erasing it?\"\n\"I’m practicing.\"\n\"You already succeeded in making it, though.\"\nLee Shin Woo chuckled and replied.\n\"That’s not it.\"\n\"Huh...?\"\n\"I feel like I might be able to use it somewhere...\"\nHonestly, there was another reason he wanted to keep in touch with Arema Steelworker and his golems. He wanted them to share their plan with him, but catching their attention just seemed much too passive of an approach.\nLee Shin Woo wanted to take a much more active approach. Like he had always done. And in order to do so...\n\"I want to obtain higher authority than just an ordinary administrator.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Shin Woo’s eyes gleamed, and the red goblin fire in his eyes shined wickedly. He was recollecting the seal that Guillotine Steelworker had created in front of the door lock. Jin, who’d finally realized what Lee Shin Woo’s true intention was, thought it was fine to just laugh.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 14 part1",
    "content": "<Chapter 14. New Pace - 1>\nGuillotine Steelworker had said that the seal he’d made was only possible for golems to create. Lee Shin Woo didn’t think that was a lie. But even so, it didn’t seem like it’d be impossible to recreate it.\n’It’s possible to copy a golem’s mana pattern, so there’s no way it’d be impossible to copy the seal.’\nBut it wasn’t something he’d be able to do in the foreseeable future. Because of that, Lee Shin Woo thoroughly examined each golem as best as he could, indulged in the core’s knowledge, and broke apart the low ranked golems to try to familiarize himself with the golems themselves.\n\"What are you going to do by copying that?\"\n\"I’m going to try controlling the golems.\"\n\"You’re trying to control Arema Steelworker?\"\n\"Nope. That guy’s probably impossible for me to control.\"\nFrom the start, Lee Shin Woo hadn’t even caught a glimpse of the highest authority over the golems. If he more deeply examined the golems, as well as absorbed more cores, he thought he’d be able to figure it out someday, but he knew that now wasn’t the time.\nFor starters, his goal would be to obtain Guillotine Steelworker’s administrator seal. So, he would gather all of the abandoned golems in the Empire and create his own corps of golems; that was his goal. If Arema Steelworker had heard him say that, he’d be speechless and fall flat on his face.\n\"I’m not going to just destroy golems, so don’t worry. If that’s all I was going to do, then why would I have taken the train and come out here? We have to take care of the undead nearby, too.\"\n\"Yay, I’m so happy...\"\nThey activated the elevator through the general administrative seal and went outside. While the west side consisted of stiff highlands, the landscape here was way too different. They wanted to check where they’d surfaced, but that was impossible.\n\"I wonder where our seniors are.\"\n\"They should be in the center of the Empire.\"\nLee Shin Woo and Jin had grown drastically, but their seniors were mostly level 6, or perhaps even higher. They still had a lot of catching up to do.\nOf course, even if they did reach their level, they absolutely wouldn’t be able to stand before them and reveal themselves to them. Would they be able to make them cease their deep-seated hatred towards the undead by just saying that they were heroes... Honestly, he was really doubtful of that right now.\n[Detecting trespasser.]\n[Repelling them as a top priority.]\n\"So like I was saying, just take them down for now.\"\n\"You!\"\n\"I can’t raise my abilities by fighting against them anymore.\"\nA golem’s greatest strength was that they had a sturdy base, but that could be a weakness as well. They were too unaccustomed to irregularities. From the very beginning, they were much too easy to take down for Lee Shin Woo, whose specialty was his irregular fighting style that lacked a concrete form.\nHearing that, Jin thought that he was shamefully boasting, but like always, he couldn’t deny it.\n\"I want to observe the golems more thoroughly. So, charge!\"\n\"Sseup, I guess it can’t be helped...\"\nJin gallantly galloped forth, with his body enveloped in steel-like mana. Lee Shin Woo saw the golems switch their battle formations to intercept him, and leisurely observed their mana patterns. Of course, because he was maintaining his general administrative seal, all of the golems aggroed on Jin.\n\"I’ve been fighting too much lately, so I’ve been tired.\"\nNo one would say anything if he took a really quick break in between analyzing the mana. Probably. He nodded his head and continued observing. However, he started to get bored from just observing and studying, so he decided to open the chatting channel.\n[Mr. Lee Shin Woo has entered.]\n[Ye Jin Jin: It’s been a long time!]\n[Lee Shin Woo: Yeah, it has. You’re still alive?]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Jeez, I have no idea who’s the senior and who’s the newbie here.]\n[Prince Altania: Lee Shin Woo, how much more have you got before you’re level 5?]\n[Lee Shin Woo: I should reach it soon. I only have about 10 more stats to go.]\nIt was a lie, of course, but they thought of 10 stats differently than him, so he had no choice.\n[Prince Altania: Holy shit. You’re really close. Even if his starting specs were high, this guy... He’s probably not more talented than me though, right?]\n[Yasunori Akira: Your talent is common amongst heroes. Doesn’t it seem strange that you’re comparing yourself to Lee Shin Woo, who everyone has high expectations for?]\n[Prince Altania: What? You want to go? Are you looking for a fight?]\n[Yasunori Akira: Pfft.]\nAs always, his seniors responded to him affectionately. Lee Shin Woo suddenly thought, after being greeted by each and every one of them. Ye Jin Jin knew about his true nature, but how would his seniors react when they saw him? Would they accept him? Would they reject him? Would they pity him?\nThe more he learned about the Underground Empire, as well as the heroes, the more he thought about his true identity. Perhaps it wouldn’t be as simple as he thought; at some point, that thought had begun to grow more and more.\n’It’s a relief that I met Ye Jin Jin when she was still naive and gave her a good impression of me.’\nHe thought it might’ve been the right decision to hide his identity and spoke calmly.\n[Lee Shin Woo: Not much happened while I was away, right?]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Ah, now that I think about it, you may not know. A newbie came in.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: A newbie...?]\nOf course, he was already well aware that it was quite common for heroes to trickle in, but it felt a bit strange that he already had a junior. Then, Prince Altania spoiled the mood.\n[Prince Altania: What a mannerless brat. They came in just a little while ago and then left right after.]\n[Erian Rendu: Mannerless? They could just be extremely individualistic. Sir Altania.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Individualistic, huh... That’s the most dangerous tendency to have. If you’re not as strong as Akira, that is.]\n[Yasunori Akira: Don’t call me by my name. ...Well, they’ll prove it soon. Whether it was arrogance or skill.]\n[Ye Jin Jin: Mr. Shin Woo, how have you been? I finally reached level 4!]\n[Shino Rendu: You’ve been dawdling all this time, yet once you found a man, you’ve become unstoppable, huh.]\n[Ye Jin Jin: W-What are you talking about!?]\nLee Shin Woo adequately told his seniors, who quarreled amongst each other and amicably went back and forth in their conversations, about himself as well as keeping some parts of himself secret, while also hearing about the situation in the Empire. He even tried to ask them about the 12 generals, but to no avail.\n[Prince Altania: Ha, the 12 generals? I’ll be straight with you. We haven’t even reached the capital, let alone the major city. It’s kind of discouraging, but it’s impossible to fight a general before you’re level 7.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Would it even be possible just by reaching level 7? You’d need to be packed with level 4 artifacts, as well as heroes using their full strength; even then, they’d barely be able to take one down. Our senior told us that before, remember?]\n[Prince Altania: Heng. As long as you and I are there, we can do it.]\n[Erian Rendu: I’m level 6 now, too! Lloyd, when the time comes, you can count on me!]\nJust taking a peek into the chatting channel, one could tell that they had the energy of top class celebrities! Lloyd, who’d even been recognized by that harsh Prince, was dazzling. To the point that he felt jealous.\nIf he had still been human, could he have been like him? However, he snorted at such fruitless thoughts and left the chatting channel. Jin was still vigorously rampaging about and breaking apart the golems.\n\"What the hell man! You weren’t even watching and were doing something else, weren’t you!? Umhp!\"\n[Ceasing function.]\n[Ceasing function.]\n\"Of course not.\"\nLee Shin Woo saw a group of golems falling with a single kick of Jin’s hind legs, and laughed calmly as he replied.\nJin had adapted much faster than he’d expected, so he decided that when Jin had become somewhat proficient in combat, he would study basic strategy for fighting on horseback with him.\n\"Hey, you help too!\"\n\"Are these all of the Reinforced Cores... tch. Ok, let’s quickly take care of the rest.\"\nAs soon as Jin had finished taking care of all the level 4 Bronze Golems in the center, Lee Shin Woo participated in the battle. Since it’d be difficult to accumulate any combat experience fighting against level 3 golems, it didn’t matter who destroyed them.\nHowever, he realized something new here. It was possible to summon copies of the same equipment stored through Bone Armory!\n\"Go, Triple Axe!\"\n\"Woah...\"\nThey kept fighting, and Jin, who’d gotten slightly confident in his abilities, saw Lee Shin Woo destroying the Defense Type Golems left and right with three Melting Bone Double Axes flying across the battlefield, and felt down in the dumps again.\nBut Lee Shin Woo, who had excitedly realized the latent potential of his ability, didn’t have time to be considerate of Jin’s feelings. The three giant axes flew naturally like boomerangs and the sight of his axes wildly plowing through the golems was in and of itself a disaster. What’s worse, he even blew up one of his axes in an area where several golems had gathered!\n\"Explode!\"\nA poison mist burst here and there across the battlefield, turning them into rock dust. The level 3 golems were now nothing more than targets that stood still to him. The power of levels and items was this absolute!\n[Ceasing fun...]\n[Function.]\n\"Heup!\"\n[Ceasing function.]\nIt was really satisfying that he was able to take out his anger on these low golems, the anger of bowing down to high level golems.\nWhenever a golem’s function would cease, the golems would exchange signals amongst themselves and would run away from him; Lee Shin Woo clearly saw them running away and mercilessly destroyed them all. It was a really wholesome time.\nAs a result.\n[Bone Original Core]\n[Reinforced Autonomous Defense Type Bone Core - Original Core Synchronization Rate: 58%]\n\"So I have about 1 and a 1/2... Tch.\"\n\"You look really scary.\"\nIn the first area, he had been able to create two Bone Original Cores, but probability was indifferent to that. He just clicked his tongue, stored the half completed Bone Core, and took out the completed one. Jin was already afraid and stepped back.\n\"You don’t need to be so afraid. Since I need to be the one absorbing them for the time being if I’m to match your growth rate.\"\n\"Thanks!\"\nHe activated Bone Reinforcement and used the Bone Original Core. Despite it being his second time absorbing it and its effectiveness being much worse, it still increased his strength by 7, agility by 11, health by 9, and magic by 6!\nAt the same time, an unfamiliar memory flowed into his mind. He was lucky; he was able to acquire a memory of their process of creating a code to control the golems.\n[The golems’ master can only be the Emperor. Aside from him, no one else can command us.]\n[We’ve only just completed your seal, Sir Arema. The seal holds the highest authority, second only to the Emperor.]\n[...Ha, to think that the circuit can only be created through a golem’s mana. Isn’t that interesting?]\n\"...\"\nLee Shin Woo momentarily shook his head and clearly remembered the appearance of the seal. At the same time, he realized why Guillotine had said it was impossible for others to recreate it.\nAll beings are born with mana that possesses innate characteristics and artificial life forms were not exempt. Within their inorganic bodies, golems stored and handled mana, and a high ranked seal was created by the mana tinged with the innate characteristics of that inorganic body.\nArema Steelworker’s seal could only be manifested by using the mana that made up his core, which would signify that the seal was only for his use. It was truly a secure security system.\n’The issue isn’t the complexity of handling your mana. It’s like using orange juice to make clear ice. ...It’ll take a while.’\nLee Shin Woo clicked his tongue. He knew it wouldn’t be easy, but he didn’t know where to start. Though the logic behind it was somewhat similar to changing his mana into acid or flames, he wasn’t even able to handle those that proficiently yet...\n\"Shin Woo, what’s wrong? Does your head hurt?\"\n\"No, not at all.\"\nLee Shin Woo bluffed and raised his head. Though Jin had realized that he was bluffing, he didn’t really point it out. Jin had realized that if Lee Shin Woo showed a bit of honesty, he was still alright.\n’It won’t help if I just hang around here. Like I had originally thought, I have no choice but to go at it while I deal with other business.’\nAt the end of his pondering, he cleanly recognized that his skills were lacking, and made up his mind. He wasn’t giving up. Lee Shin Woo just decided that he wouldn’t rush, and would slowly work at it whilst taking care of other business at the same time!\n\"With that in mind, let’s go down. How can a person live off killing golems?\"\n\"You have a multiple personality disorder, right? Right?\"\nEven while he complained, Jin and Lee Shin Woo went down the highlands and surveyed their surroundings. However, they didn’t really get anything out of that. It seemed as though one of their senior heroes had gone through this place already, as there weren’t any undead here, and it was completely clean. This became more apparent soon after they felt a refreshing feeling when they entered a city on the outskirts without any undead in sight.\n\"SSeup.\"\n\"Let’s go someplace else. There might be another city, as well as a dungeon nearby.\"\nIn no time at all, Jin had resigned himself and spoke aloofly, figuring out what Lee Shin Woo wanted. However, Lee Shin Woo firmly shook his head. Newest update provıded by N0veI.Fiɾe.net\n\"There’s a place we need to examine before we leave here.\"\n\"? Can’t you see that the city’s clean?\"\n\"No. There’s a place where it’s highly likely that it hasn’t been cleared yet.\"\n\"And where’s that...?\"\nJin tilted his head, but Lee Shin Woo just grinned and lead Jin. All Jin felt was a sense of gloomy foreboding, but he followed behind Lee Shin Woo regardless.\n[You have discovered the Polluted Sewer Facility. All stats increase by 5 within.]\nAnd less than three hours later, they entered into a desolate, hidden underground facility. There were elite skeletons that stood in front of them in an orderly fashion whilst continuously spewing out jet-black mana.\n[My name is Paul 13... I have to punish the erroneous Emperor!]\n[To think that there are still this many men who still follow General Seagald!]\n[We have all been given a new name and purpose!]\n[Paul Zero!]\n[Paul Zero! Paul Zero!]\n\"Yes, yes. I know my name is Paul Zero, so you don’t have to keep shouting it.\"\n\"Shin Woo, you, what was your original goal again...?\"\n\"Well, since we’re already here. Might as well.\"\nOn that day, eight new elite skeletons were born: Paul 13 through Paul 20.\nNo one yet knew that a new force was being formed within the Empire.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 14 part2",
    "content": "<Chapter 14. New Pace - 2>\n2 more weeks passed. Lee Shin Woo and Jin started at the southern outskirts and after searching through the city in the area, they took the train and returned east. After checking that area, they took the train once again, and reached the Empire’s northern outskirts.\nRight now, they were ’slowly clearing the outer edges of the Empire’, something that no other hero could have even attempted. Since they had procured a means of transportation, they decided they might as well clear the outskirts of the Empire. Though the scale was obviously much too large to say that they were doing it just ’because they could’.\n\"Ah, there’s one here too. They didn’t go through here.\"\nOf course, most of the areas had been cleared by the other heroes, and in some places, it seemed as though the golems had vanished without a trace, so at times, it was a fruitless effort; but there was a place with a 100% chance of remaining, which was none other than the city’s underground sewers dungeons.\n\"I hope this place is less dirty than the last place...\"\n\"Give up. Let’s go in.\"\n\"Damn it!\"\nLee Shin Woo was now fully aware that the reason the other heroes didn’t go through the ’underground’ passages was because they were ’dirty’. He thought the other heroes were foolish for not going through the sewers just so they could avoid getting dirtied; it wasn’t even very difficult to wash off the filth. But in any case, because they did, Lee Shin Woo and Jin could profit off of it, so he didn’t really think about it too deeply.\nAs a result, Lee Shin Woo had another task that clearly bore more fruit than his original goal of either creating another Bone Original Core, or procuring a high rank administrative authority...\n[The number of undead who have been given a new name by you and have thus been reborn as named monsters has surpassed 100. Without even thinking about the consequences and acting on a whim are truly the actions of a Joker. All stats have increased by 5. You have satisfied a part of the conditions to obtain the Joker’s innate skill.]\nIt was to revive the failed experimental subjects of the Anti-Skull Project as elite skeletons. Since the experiments were performed without the Emperor’s knowledge, there was almost a 100% chance that a hidden facility would exist within the outskirt cities’ sewers!\n[Even if we look for General Seagald, we probably wouldn’t be able to help very much.]\n[We’d rather follow you, Captain. We’ll help our Captain!]\n\"No. I have something else I have to do. Think about what you guys can do and go do it. Paul 107!\"\n[Ugh... As expected of our Captain. You’re saying that we have to find our own path...!]\nThere was a special characteristic that was commonplace amongst the skeletons that had been awakened as named elites by Lee Shin Woo; no matter what he said, they would understand and be moved.\n[We’ll definitely repay Captain one day, the one who awakened us!]\n[We may have undying bodies, but let’s make it to the end together, Captain!]\n\"Yeah, yeah. You guys don’t die, too.\"\nThe skeletons developed loyalty to him all on their own and promised to meet with him again, yet Lee Shin Woo just responded with a lukewarm gaze.\nHonestly, level 3 elite monsters didn’t really matter to him anymore. He’d said this time after time, but this was just something he was doing on the way to killing golems.\n\"Ah, and if you meet the other Pauls, make sure you travel together.\"\n[I understand, Captain!]\nAnd that’s the last thing he said to them formally. They were sacrificed in the same experiment, were likewise reborn as elite undead, and were a similar level, so that’s why he said it. However, the Pauls earnestly responded to his request and left the sewers. Jin watched their appearances from behind and asked Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Do you have some sort of special skill that turns the undead into elite monsters?\"\n\"Nope. I just make them feel as though ’they had an important mission while they were still alive’ and they just awaken on their own.\"\n\"...\"\nDespite him achieving the feat of going around and changing people’s fates, Lee Shin Woo responded extremely calmly; seeing that, Jin was speechless. Lee Shin Woo had only given him a rough explanation of how his Joker karma worked.\n\"There’re no rewards here, either... Well, it is the outskirts after all. Let’s clear this place and then go to somewhere with a danger level of 2.\"\n\"A danger level of 2...\"\nBased on their seniors’ classifications, who had already explored the Empire, the Empire is apparently divided into five danger levels from the outskirts to the center.\nThe first place they encounter once entering the Empire has a danger level of 0, and messy natural environments (apparently, a lot of animal type undead appear here), whereas the small towns in between are level 1.\nSo, Lee Shin Woo and Jin were currently clearing out areas that were danger level 0 - 1. If they used pizza as a comparison, they were going around and eating the crust first.\n’The natural environment is getting a bit better, and the commercial cities, where we’re more likely to encounter the Empire’s elite troops have a danger level of 2. They’re the places that the heroes stay in when they’re at around level 4 or 5... And the satellite cities, which are directly connected to these commercial cities have a danger level of 3. Apparently, most of the heroes are around this area.’\nThe large city was a level 4 danger zone, and was allocated tasks by the capital; naturally, the center of the Empire, the capital, held a danger level of 5. It was difficult for even their senior heroes to explore the areas that were of danger level 4, so there wasn’t much more he could hear from them.\n’There’s definitely a supply line that passes through a large city with a danger level of 4.’\nOriginally, there was a supply line that passed through the capital, but in the process of running from the capital with his subordinates, Arema Steelworker completely destroyed that railway. If that railway had still existed and if no one else had discovered it, it would’ve been possible to infiltrate the capital, so it kind of felt like a waste.\n\"Then shall we look around and see if there are any other small towns nearby?\"\n\"Ah... alright.\"\nLee Shin Woo had been imagining events that had yet to come, but when he heard Jin speak, he stopped thinking about it.\n\"Yeah, there should be another way to infiltrate the capital.\"\n\"Your plan already went that far!?\"\nThe two crawled out of the sewers. When they had looked from the highlands, they had seen another small town to the west, so they decided to go there and look before getting on the train.\nGenerally, the other heroes would purify one small town and then immediately move on to the next area, so he had hope that there were some undead still remaining over there.\n\"Then... Huh?\"\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo, who’d turned his head towards the west where the small town was, suddenly felt an unfamiliar, but powerful trace of mana, causing his goblin fire to wriggle around.\nIt was a mana pattern that he’d felt somewhere before... when he deliberated as to where, he concluded that it was definitely similar to Ye Jin Jin’s mana.\n’Ah, that’s right.’\nIt was the mana of a living being. He was proud of himself for being able to categorize the mana and grinned; Lee Shin Woo’s face hardened and he rode atop Jin’s back.\n\"Let’s run for now. Our concept is secrecy, isn’t it?\"\n\"That’s a good idea.\"\nJin also didn’t like taking unnecessary risks. The two reached an agreement, and then Jin dashed in a straight line towards the highlands while Lee Shin Woo activated his connection with Jin and Stealth simultaneously, hiding their tracks as much as possible.\nTheir practice fighting together bore fruit and they were able to achieve considerable results. However.\n\"What the hell? Aren’t they getting closer?\"\n\"What, really?\"\nThe problem was that their opponent was much more talented than they could’ve imagined.\n\"Shin Woo, what do we do? Should we just release Stealth and just run at full speed?\"\n\"That seems like a better idea!\"\n\"Alright. Hold on tight!\"\n\"Gahhhhhhh!\"\nTheir combat abilities weren’t the only thing that improved from them clearing out the golems in the highlands and hopping from one sewer system to another. Though Jin had only absorbed three cores, he was able to use the magic and martial arts knowledge within in order to better utilize his agility!\nAbove all, he’d learned how to correct his speed and stability through magic, and as a result, managed to increase his already fraudulent speed. If he broke their connection, and Jin focused solely on reaching his destination, most people wouldn’t even be able to see him as he was running so fast!\n\"I’m going even faster!\"\n\"Ah, shit. Damn it.\"\nHowever, the speed made Lee Shin Woo feel as though he would be thrown off, and despite experiencing it in real time, he spoke out in a voice tinged with despair. He didn’t know how, but their opponent was gradually getting closer!\n’One moment I can’t sense them, and in the next, they’ve gotten closer; this keeps happening over and over again. Wait a sec, this... is this some sort of teleportation magic?’\nSince he’d been dropped into the Underground Empire, he’d experienced all kinds of magical situations; however, he’d never experienced any mainstream magic before. Because of that, his deduction had been late. If it wasn’t physically possible to catch up to them, then the only other answer was magic!\n\"Lend me the Queen’s unmelting ice...\"\nHe sensed that they’d gotten even closer. Moreover, he even heard their incantation for what he assumed was an offensive spell. Lee Shin Woo was slightly shocked by the pristinely beautiful voice he heard casting the spell. He was especially shocked at the incantation that openly revealed that the spell was an ice type attack.\nBut wait, they were thankful that their opponent was going to cast their spell where everyone could hear it, but since it was so easy to predict, it became so boring!\n\"And annihilate all that is unjust, bringing about an eternal snow that purifies...\"\nIn the time it took for them to blink, they had arrived at the center of the highlands. However, around that time, their opponent had gotten close enough that they could see them with the naked eye.\n\"Appear!\"\nLee Shin Woo turned around slightly and checked their opponent’s identity. They wore robes, covering their forehead such that he couldn’t get a close look at them, but in any case, he was sure that it was a living person. They were probably a hero at that!\n\"Wall of...!\"\n\"Tch!\"\nYeah, he understood. They just saw a skeleton riding atop a galloping skeleton horse, so as a hero, it made sense that they wanted to attack them! But before they followed through, they should’ve given them a signal; no wait, I guess they don’t have to!\n\"Ice!\"\n\"Flames of Revenge!\"\nThey had finished casting their spell! At the same time, they felt a chill surge from beneath their feet, and Lee Shin Woo somehow used Flames of Revenge in time.\nIt seemed obvious, but it was impossible for the spell to cover the entire area. Lee Shin Woo was satisfied with covering just himself and Jin with the flames and... yelled!\n\"Jin, run!\"\n\"I can fly! [1]\"\n\"!?\"\n\"Ugh!\"\nJin dashed through the air; it was truly a beautiful leap. They dodged the enormous ice walls that surged from the floor with a force that touched the Underground Empire’s ceiling!\n\"Ice Arrow Shower!\"\n\"How persistent!\"\nThe magician’s ice walls tried to keep them in place, but lost much of their power due to the Flames of Revenge. However, it seemed as though their opponent still had mana to spare, as they followed up with another spell.\nThey didn’t even need to cast the spell for very long and it was a low ranked spell, but the sheer number of them was considerable. The air was instantly filled to the brim with ice arrows and those arrows rushed towards them, aiming only for them!\n\"Shin Woo!\"\n\"It’s ok.\"\nIf their opponent used lightning, wind, or flames, it might’ve gotten dangerous for them, but ice magic was fine!\nLee Shin Woo hugged Jin’s neck and covered themselves entirety in the Flames of Revenge; at the same time, he shared his Intermediate Ice Resistance through the contract. It was a absurdly high ranked skill technique.\n[Intermediate Ice Protection will protect your partner as well. Blocking at least 70% of the attack.]\n[The Intermediate Ice Resistance skill has become Lv2. Magic has increased by 5.]\nThe barrage of ice arrows fell upon them instantly and pounded on their bodies... No, rather than pounding them, most of the ice arrows damage dissipated due to his ice resistance, and the Flames of Revenge melted the rest. He had been confident, but it was such a perfect defense that he praised himself.\n\"How can an undead possess such a high rank mana technique...?\"\nSeriously. How amazing must it have been if his opponent had stopped their attack in shock. However, now wasn’t the time to be impressed! Before his opponent regained their cool and started attacking again, Lee Shin Woo wanted to do away with the status quo, so he yelled.\n\"Stop!\"\n\"What...?\"\nTheir opponent flinched at his voice, as it definitely contained a will behind it. Lee Shin Woo took that opportunity to yell loudly, which reverberated across the highlands.\n\"Friendly fire!\"\n[1] T/N: This is written exactly how it sounds in English.

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 14 part3",
    "content": "<Chapter 14. New Pace - 3>\n\"Friendly fire...?\"\n\"That’s right. I’m a hero!\"\n\"A hero!?\"\nThe Magician muttered blankly. Hearing an undead assert that they were a hero must’ve considerably shaken them; they had already stopped attacking. Lee Shin Woo felt relieved in that regard, but then Jin yelled startlingly.\n\"The ground. The ground!\"\n\"Tch...\"\nThe problem was the spell that they’d cast before was still around. The wall, composed of sharp thorns of ice were surging upwards several dozens of meters! Now wasn’t the time be relieved!\n\"Heup!\"\nWithout thinking, Lee Shin Woo brought out a Melting Double Bone Axe and threw it hard. The axe shattered the wall’s sharp edges, and exploded the moment it lodged into the wall’s interior; even though they had responded a bit late, Lee Shin Woo and Jin somehow managed to come out relatively unscathed, amidst the shards of ice.\n\"I thought we’d become skewers.\"\n\"Don’t worry, we don’t have any meat to grill, so... Wait, no. It’s my fault. I’m sorry. Stop shaking.\"\n\"You’re really terrible. You know that? Absolutely terrible.\"\n\"It was all my fault. I’m really sorry. Stop shaking.\"\n\"It certainly doesn’t seem like you’ve been affected by the curse...\"\nWhile Lee Shin Woo and Jin were struggling to find a way to survive, the Magician watched them and spoke to herself. But for now, they had completely ignored the Magician in favor of reaching safe ground. They barely felt at ease.\n\"Are you really heroes? Even though you’re undead...?\"\nAt last, she went back to questioning them. The slim woman stretched her hand outwards from her magician robes, holding an orb that looked like a crystal; it seemed as though she had her magic at the ready depending on how they responded.\n\"We’re undead, but we’re definitely heroes. If...\"\nThe situation wasn’t favorable for them, and he assumed that they’d ultimately have to fight the magician; he analyzed his opponent’s magic, and while doing so, picked one of the lines that only a hero would know to say and just said it.\n\"If you can’t believe me, then would you like to access the chatting channel together and check?\"\n\"The chatting channel... right, there was that.\"\nIt hit the mark. The Magician’s hostility towards them was noticeably diminishing. He also considered that she might be a hero that attacked, saying ’Death to all the undead!’, even after acknowledging his claim, but fortunately, it looked like she had abandoned all thoughts of attacking them.\n\"It was impossible to ascertain your identity, so I thought maybe... I couldn’t bring myself to discard the possibility that were you some unknown undead. Sorry for attacking you.\"\n\"Ah... now that I think about it.\"\nShe’d even given them an earnest apology! Even after hearing that, Lee Shin Woo inspected her, but he couldn’t figure anything out about her. A hero’s fundamental ability of checking their opponent’s level and identity didn’t work on her. Now that he thought about it, it didn’t work on Jin or Ye Jin Jin either.\nIf that’s the case, then it should’ve been plenty enough to discern that they were heroes, but... Lee Shin Woo decided he’d double check that in the chatting channel later and replied.\n\"I’m Lee Shin Woo. This guy’s Jin. For the record, this guy’s a hero too.\"\n\"Kratia Melloi [1].\"\nThe magician threw her robe’s hood back, revealing her face and name. She was a young lady whose beauty matched her beautiful voice; she was short, so he had roughly assumed that she was a woman before, but she looked younger than he’d expected, so Lee Shin Woo was shocked.\nHer eyes were a sky blue, like the frozen sea, with large pupils; her lavender hair, which stretched in every which way as if she didn’t bother to comb it, was especially memorable. To be completely honest, her appearance matched well with the magic she wields.\n’In any case, I’ve never seen someone called Kratia Melloi enter the chatting channel before... Wait a sec.’\nAssuming that she wasn’t lying, as she gave her name and showed her appearance, there was someone who matched her description. Latest content publıshed on ɴovelfire.net\n\"How long has it been since you’ve arrived here?\"\n\"3 weeks.\"\n\"As I thought...\"\nShe was definitely the ’newbie’ that he’d heard about in the chatting channel a short while ago. Kratia must’ve been the one who had entered the chatting channel once and left immediately, as she felt uncomfortable with all of the seniors’ attention on her. His seniors did say that she didn’t enter again following that incident.\nBut what was surprising was that it had only been 3 weeks since she’d been dropped underground, yet the level of her magic was considerable. Lee Shin Woo couldn’t even assess the level of her magic, so that meant she was at least higher than level 5. But if that were true, that meant that she started out with that much power. Otherwise, she had to have received that power from God.\n\"Do I become like you guys by any chance if a lot of time goes by?\"\nThe Magician, Kratia Melloi asked, her eyes filled with a bit of fear. Lee Shin Woo and Jin simultaneously shook their heads and denied her. This confirmed that she was indeed a newbie hero.\n\"We became like this because of our wishes. On the flip side, there were some things we got in exchange, but I can’t really recommend it.\"\n\"You became undead because of your wishes? ...As I thought, that woman’s got a mental disorder or something.\"\nShe nonchalantly insulted God and shook her head. And even though he didn’t ask, she extended her hand gripping the orb and said.\n\"I don’t like other people touching me. So when I asked for ice that could grow, she gave me this.\"\n\"So she could fulfill that wish because you were already strong, huh...\"\nThough she was originally a powerful magician, there should’ve been a limit to what God could give her with her powers; she’d successfully managed to receive an artifact that developed all on its own, so she may have made the best choice.\nIf his senior heroes were to have heard, they would’ve said something like ’you should’ve asked for a skill that improves the effectiveness of ice type abilities!’ and would’ve been frustrated in her stead.\n\"Shin Woo, what are you going to do?\"\nRight when he was finished thinking, Jin whispered to Lee Shin Woo. Jin, who was easily frightened, seemed to still be afraid of Kratia, as he was secretly hiding behind his back.\nIs this really the guy who courageously yelled out that when they died, they would die together... Lee Shin Woo softly stroked his back to tell him it was alright and said his farewells to Kratia.\n\"I don’t think there are a lot of cases like us, but be careful from now on. Then, we’ll get going. It was nice meeting you, Kratia Melloi.\"\n\"Wait a sec.\"\nHe got atop Jin’s back and tried turning around, but Kratia’s sudden urgent voice stopped them. Lee Shin Woo felt Jin inwardly yell, as he’d wanted to leave smoothly.\n\"I know I’ve been somewhat foolish. Teach me about how this world works.\"\n\"If you just enter the chatting channel, our seniors will scramble to teach to you. Especially, Lloyd and Prince.\"\n\"Those guys make me feel uneasy. I also haven’t seen their faces even once...\"\nKratia asserted quite firmly. Their seniors had a tendency to be way too excited when a newbie comes in, so it was understandable that she felt unnerved by them. Moreover, though he hadn’t known her for very long, this woman didn’t seem to like socializing very much.\nEven so, didn’t it seem weird that she trusted an undead whose face she’d seen, rather than a human whose face she hadn’t seen? At least, that’s what Lee Shin Woo thought.\n\"But you’re ok. And... I’m curious.\"\nShe probably isn’t the type to like undead more than humans; Lee Shin Woo tilted his head, wondering what he had to say, and replied in a way that went beyond his imagination.\n\"The way you use your magic. I want to learn it too.\"\n\"Oh, you were curious about that?\"\n\"I’m not asking to learn for free. I have a good grasp on magic as well. There’s probably stuff that I can help with for you two as well.\"\nThe situation was taking a turn beyond his wildest imagination. Lee Shin Woo had originally thought that it would be a waste of time and that he should just refuse, but he stopped for two separate reasons.\nFirst off, no matter how he looked at it, she was a professionally trained magician, and would naturally know more about magic across the board. There’s a chance he’d profit from this exchange of knowledge, but honestly, there was also a chance that he would gain absolutely nothing.\nAnd secondly, he hadn’t yet found a way to create a high rank administrative authority. If he were to get a hint from her regarding changes in the characteristics of mana, wouldn’t this be considered progress as well...? He thought it wouldn’t be bad to bet on this, rather than continuously hunting golems at a snail’s pace.\n\"Shin Woo, you’re not going to, are you?\"\n\"Well, it actually doesn’t sound too bad...\"\nLee Shin Woo commented in favor, and Jin weighed in with a slightly displeased tone.\n\"Is it because she’s pretty?\"\n\"I’d like to act immature and senseless like that sometime too.\"\nLee Shin Woo scolded, and turned his head towards Kratia. He’d made up his mind, and already finished talking with his partner, so now it was time to earnestly negotiate terms.\n\"We can’t stay with you forever.\"\n\"2 weeks.\"\n\"Promise that you’ll sincerely cooperate, even if you don’t gain what you want.\"\n\"You have my word. I promise upon the everlasting mana.\"\n\"Promise that whatever goes on between us, you leak nothing to the outside.\"\n\"Likewise.\"\n\"Alright. Then we’ll be in your care for 2 weeks. So...\"\n\"Kratia. Nice meeting you, Shin Woo.\"\nLee Shin Woo thoughtlessly extended his right hand, a habit from his time as a human, and Kratia unhesitatingly grabbed his bare bone hand. She really didn’t care that he was undead, and proved that she was only interested in his knowledge and ability.\nThough their purity was directed at different things, Lee Shin Woo suddenly thought that in terms of innocence, she and Ye Jin Jin were quite similar. From right beside him, Jin then asked.\n\"Then what do I do...?\"\n\"What are you talking about? You’re the one who needs systematic instruction on magic. We’re one plus one, remember?\"\n\"I knew this would happen...\"\nEven whilst complaining, Jin strangely felt moved that Lee Shin Woo was looking out for him. Seeing Jin, who’d come into possession of such a twisted feeling, Kratia seemed to be concerned about something and her eyes brightened; she soon tilted her head and turned her attention to Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Then let’s get going immediately. I want to know how your power works.\"\n\"Hey, wait. Didn’t you want to learn about all that common knowledge you were missing?\"\n\"I can just hear that stuff with the time we have left over.\"\nShe wasn’t reversing their priority. From the very beginning, her primary objective was magic. Lee Shin Woo thought he somewhat understood her personality, shrugged his shoulders, and with no alternatives, just began talking.\nLee Shin Woo and Jin explained that they had a special contract, and using the resulting connection that came from using the Horseback Riding skill, could share their skills and resistances with each other; after hearing of this, it didn’t take long before Kratia became disappointed.\n\"But it’s fine. Since the way you use your mana is plenty interesting. There’s a lot I can learn from your freewheeling style. The mana you’ve accumulated is amazing, seeing as how you went from not knowing anything to this.\"\n\"I’m more jealous of the mana you’ve accumulated, though...\"\nContrary to Lee Shin Woo, who controlled the mana itself, Kratia had studied for countless years and ultimately, developed a special method of causing the mana to change.\nIf he changed mana purely through his will and the skill’s ability, Kratia calculated the countless ways in which the mana could change beforehand, and brought about the desired change at the right time. Lee Shin Woo’s method of handling magic was clumsy in comparison.\n\"It’s not the way of a magician. But it’s not the way a knight uses mana either. To be specific, Shin Woo... you seem like a monster gifted with supernatural powers.\"\n\"...Isn’t it because I’m an undead?\"\nLee Shin Woo flinched the moment she pointed that out, but he replied calmly for now. However, Kratia firmly shook her head.\n\"An undead being can’t control this many mana patterns. You may even understand the essence of mana more than I do. If I can imitate even just a part of what you do, my magic could undergo a groundbreaking change...\"\n\"Shin Woo, I don’t understand this at all.\"\n\"You just memorize everything for now. It’ll come up in the test.\"\nHe was able to make some strides. Kratia taught Lee Shin Woo the theory established by scholars and magicians on mana, and he was able to figure out how to more effectively handle his mana, which he’d been manipulating instinctually up until now; on the other hand, Kratia got a hint on how to improve her magic by learning about Lee Shin Woo’s skills and peculiar method of using magic, which went against common sense.\n\"Ah, so this is how you do it. Just by introducing a few basic patterns, I can apply my magic much faster than before.\"\n\"H-How did you learn that already?\"\nUltimately, Lee Shin Woo was successfully able to make large strides in magic one week into his contract with Kratia. She thought if she taught him, it would be helpful to him someday, but he had advanced at a speed which went beyond her imagination.\n[The Low Rank Mana Bone skill has become Lv10, and evolves to the Intermediate level. Your understanding of magic deepens, and you can more effectively store more mana into your bones. The power of your mana increases as well. Magic has increased by 30.]\n[You have fulfilled a portion of the conditions necessary to achieve the Joker’s innate skill. You have only one step left remaining before you become a true Joker.]\nAnd at that very moment... Lee Shin Woo got a message that he hadn’t expected at all.\n[A quest has occurred!]\n[Joker’s mana]\n[You are extremely free-spirited, and are capable of imitating anything. That’s right. You can even imitate another person’s mana. It’s fine if you have a special mission, and if you don’t, that’s fine as well. Please acquire a high ranked administrative authority by copying a golem’s mana.]\n[Quest reward - 3 permits to God’s secret shop, Joker’s innate skill]\n[1] T/N: Probably a loose Fate/Stay Night reference to the El-Melloi line of magicians.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 15 part1",
    "content": "<Chapter 15. New Relationship - 1>\n’I didn’t think I’d get a quest here. Not to mention that it’s a quest that pretty much read my mind...’\nLee Shin Woo examined the quest details and was speechless. Of course, it was true that he wanted a high rank administrator’s authority in order to create a high rank administrative seal, but to think, it was connected to his Joker’s karma. What’s worse, it showed up as a quest?\nPlus, the quest acted as though it was only natural that he should possess an ability like that as a Joker, so he did feel a bit spiteful.\n\"Huh? A quest?\"\n\"That’s right.\"\nKratia, whose mana affinity was comparable to Lee Shin Woo’s, sensed the flow of mana before her.\nLee Shin Woo nodded his head and Kratia’s lips slightly budged, but she soon slightly shook her head. It seems as though she was going to ask him about the quest but decided not to.\n\"It seems like your mana has increased considerably.\"\n\"You’re right. It’s because of you.\"\n\"Mm... It feels like I’ll succeed too.\"\nKratia froze the mana in the air and attempted to make a statue. He couldn’t tell in any detail what she was talking about just by watching her draw upon the ice element and utilize some sort of magical catalyst.\n\"I feel like I’ll need to try the magic out in battle. Let’s go hunting.\"\n\"Party hunting?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nIt wasn’t an item originally included in their contract, but... Lee Shin Woo had just received a new, worrying task; though as worrying as it was, her offer didn’t sound so bad. In other words, he was escaping reality right now, but it wouldn’t be so bad to empty his head out first.\n\"Jin, what about you?\"\n\"I’d like to run a bit, too.\"\nJin was in full agreement, as his head had been crammed with complicated theories regarding mana all week long. His ability to handle mana had improved significantly as well, and he wanted to apply that knowledge in live combat.\n\"Then, shall we go? By the way, I was thinking we should start skipping to the level 2 danger zones (commercial cities).\"\n\"I feel like we could go directly to the level 3 zones.\"\n\"What’s your level, anyway?\"\n\"6.\"\nHe had a rough idea before, but she was at a much higher level than them. Lee Shin Woo recollected their previous encounter and broke out into a cold sweat thinking, ’I sure blocked her magic well, despite her being such a higher level than me.’\n\"We can’t, since we’re still too weak. In any case, let’s go at it step by step.\"\n\"Mm.\"\nLee Shin Woo got on Jin’s back and Kratia used her magic to float into the air. When Lee Shin Woo asked her how long she could stay in the air like that, she replied that she could maintain it all day.\n\"The mana consumption isn’t severe, so long as I don’t use teleportation magic.\"\n\"Magicians sure are scary.\"\n\"It’s not something that any old magician can...\"\n\"Then, let’s get going!\"\nJin pretended to listen to Kratia, who was overflowing with pride, and began to sprint. It was a perfect dash, befitting one who used to be a sprinter! It seemed like the shock would unearth the ground, and in the next instant, the landscape had already begun to change.\n\"Oh...!\"\n\"Hey.\"\nKratia was about to say something more, but stopped in shock and followed behind them. Lee Shin Woo softly flicked Jin’s head, who had elatedly dashed forward ahead of her. He wasn’t a little kid teasing the girl he liked, so what the hell was he doing?\n\"Let’s go south. There should still be a commercial city down there that our seniors haven’t found yet.\"\n\"It’d be nice if there was a dungeon there. A dungeon with growing fruit trees.\"\nBecause Lee Shin Woo and Jin were undead, they didn’t need to eat, but that wasn’t the case for the other heroes. So after they ate the provisions they were given at the beginning, they would have to look for dungeons with either plants or animals, or buy supplies from the secret shop.\nLee Shin Woo only went to the secret shop whenever he leveled up to buy some good bones... he thought of it as a more of a butcher’s shop, but the other heroes considered it a place to buy food, a facility with more importance than any other.\n\"I like fruit too.\"\n\"Jin, you can’t start thinking like that.\"\n\"...My bad.\"\n\"It’s not your fault.\"\nThe most saddening thing from becoming undead wasn’t the loss of sexual desire, or even the loss of their hair. It was that they couldn’t eat anymore. They didn’t even have the desire to eat anything, so that in itself was shocking to them, but if they started to think deeply upon the subject, they would truly become hopelessly depressed.\nThey had been ok until now, since it had only been the two of them, but they’d become pointlessly conscious of it since traveling with a living being who requires nutrition, Kratia.\n\"I’ll kill that god someday.\"\n\"Yeah, that’s the way to think.\"\nLee Shin Woo and Jin were fostering a hatred towards God. Who the hell could look at them and call them heroes!? Kratia was just startled by their vigor.\nHow long had they been running like that? If he was still in South Korea, it felt as though they had travelled from Seoul to Busan, and at that time, Kratia, who had been floating in the air, at a higher altitude than them, discovered something.\n\"Undead troops.\"\n\"Good. That means we’re slowly getting closer to the city.\"\nFundamentally, the undead had a tendency to repeat what they had done while they were still alive. The undead troops would flock to the cities to defend them, and it was highly likely that they were in the vicinity of a city.\n\"The undead are fighting amongst themselves, though.\"\n\"Huh!?\"\nSoon, Lee Shin Woo sensed it. Countless undead were fighting against a small minority of undead, possessing a powerful energy... to be exact, it was the magic of level 3 elite undead! Lee Shin Woo suddenly realized what this magic was, which seemed to be drawing him somewhere, and yelled.\n\"Is it the Pauls by any chance!?\"\n\"Could you please do something about that naming sense of yours...\"\n\"Pauls...?\"\n\"Jin, run fast!\"\n\"Tch... Full speed sprint!\"\nAt that moment, Jin, who was plentifully fast enough, got even faster. Whether it were a tree, a rock, or even a forest, he would break through it all and run in a straight line to reach his destination!\nThrough training, Jin could use his stats to their utmost for an instant, and Lee Shin Woo inwardly named his ability to run like lightning the Pope [1] Sprint.\n[Yeah, those guys are...!]\n[Ah, Captain!]\n[Captain’s come to save us!]\n[Everyone, raise your heads; Paul Zero is here!]\nEven in the midst of battle, the undead were quick to notice Lee Shin Woo and Jin, who had approached quickly. There were twenty two Pauls that Lee Shin Woo had personally named there, and they were fighting fiercely against a group of 300 undead.\nAgainst a group of undead that were at least level 2 or 3! Amongst them, there were even some level 4 undead mixed in; Lee Shin Woo was surprised that the Pauls kept fighting and hadn’t sustained any casualties yet.\n[Paul Zero!]\n[Paul Zero...!? Are you perhaps on the same side of these crazy traitors!?]\nHe didn’t know how they had come to fight one another, but for starters, Lee Shin Woo decided to help the Pauls. He naturally took out a Melting Double Bone Axe, threw it, and yelled.\n\"Love! Comes back! [2]\"\n[How foolish of you to throw your weapon away! Oh!?]\n\"I said that it would come back, didn’t I?\"\nThe level 4 Skeleton Knight at the forefront easily parried the axe, but the axe, which had bounced into the air, flew back towards the knight, as if a rewind button had been pressed, causing its weapon to spring out of its hand.\n[You bastard. I don’t know what cowardly magic you used, but...]\n- Kwaaaaang!\nHowever, the Skeleton Knight panicked and the moment it bowed its head to pick up its weapon, the axe blew up in a grand explosion and spewed acid mist everywhere! The Knight, who had been wide open, didn’t even get the chance to raise its mana to resist, and was swept away by the explosion and completely destroyed.\nLee Shin Woo satisfyingly watched as the following acid mist melted away the undead battalion and yelled firmly.\n\"Pauls, retreat for now!\"\n[I understand, Captain!]\n[In the time we haven’t seen him, our Captain’s abilities have improved even further!]\nThe Pauls were awed at how commanding Lee Shin Woo appeared, after taking down the level 4 Skeleton Knight, and retreated from the battlefield. Right on time, Kratia arrived on the battlefield, and gazed at Lee Shin Woo disbelievingly.\n\"You can command the undead? What exactly are you...?\"\n\"Call me Paul Zero right now. Also, there are good undead in this world too, you know. I’ll explain later, so take down those undead for now.\" Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on novel★fire.net\n\"Paul Zero...? Good undead...?\"\n[How can this be? She’s alive!]\n[Ooooh, so it was possible to break free of the curse!]\n\"!?!?\"\nLee Shin Woo’s words were like a riddle, and Kratia tilted her head; the Pauls who had seen her cheered. Rather than burning with hatred towards the living, they were actually happy to see her!?\n\"What is happening...?\"\nKratia was much too unfamiliar with the Pauls’ response, and thought that her understanding of the undead until now had been wrong.\nYet, while confirming that, she turned her head, only to find that a battalion of undead had discovered her, and were yelling in hatred.\n[A living person!]\n[A person with flowing blood and fresh flesh!]\n[I hate you. That woman’s definitely the person who made us like this!]\n[Let’s make her just like us; we’ll rip out her hair, rip off her flesh, and suck the blood out of her!]\nTruly gruesome and brutal lines just kept coming. Ironically, their statements set her at ease. With her mind at ease, she cast her magic upon the skeletons.\n\"Ice Arrow Shower!\"\n[It’s magic!]\n[Call our magicians!]\n[But our magicians are guarding the walls!]\n[Gguaaaaahk!]\nThe large scale spell that came from a level 6 magician was tremendous! Several hundreds of ice arrows formed into the air, packed tightly, and poured upon the battlefront. Even level 3 skeletons couldn’t easily approach, and the level 2 weaklings were just immediately destroyed by the arrows.\n’Normally, I would buy time like this and would press my advantage with a more effective spell, but...’\nBut she didn’t have the spare time to do so right now. Why? Because Lee Shin Woo would take them all down if she wasted time. At least, that’s what Kratia thought; in reality, that’s what was currently happening. Lee Shin Woo and Jin had already gallantly charged in with Lee Shin Woo swinging his giant axe, breaking them into pieces!\n\"We could’ve become good friends, too. Sorry, Pauls!\"\n[Gguaaaaahk!]\n[N-Now I’ll finally be able to rest in...]\nThe weak skeleton that had once needed to act in order to barely defeat a Skeleton Soldier didn’t exist anymore. Even if Lee Shin Woo was trapped in a drill ground filled with level 3 skeletons, they wouldn’t be able to handle him.\nHis long distance explosive attack through Rule of Bone wasn’t the only thing powerful about him. He had accumulated various knowledge regarding magic, and developed a solid foundation for close quarters combat where such magic could be applied. Lee Shin Woo’s axe was now covered in lightning, albeit weak, and the skeletons in the area were brutally burned or crushed.\nThe rare weapon technique, Bursting Thunder was finally starting to bear fruit!\n’But I’m not there yet. When I’m finally able to produce lightning all on my own with my mana, maybe I’ll get some kind of hint that helps me with mimicking a golem’s mana...!’\nHe had come here to clear his mind, yet even as he fought, he thought about that damn golem. Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly while rotating his arm and swinging his axe.\n[Ugh!?]\nThen, a Skeleton Knight attacked from behind, and Lee Shin Woo’s axe clashed with its sword; he shattered the sword without much difficulty. His reaction was only possible because of his exceptional, developed mana senses.\n[How is this possible? My sword, tempered with my loyalty to the Emperor, has been...!]\n\"It seems like you just weren’t loyal enough.\"\nHe replied uninterested and cut off the knight’s head with Power Slash. Beyond the corpse of the dead knight’s crumbling body, he saw the leftover bones littering the battlefield.\nThe battle was over in the blink of an eye. It was a complete victory.\n[1] T/N: Could be a reference to Willian Popp, the soccer player, as the name could be translated as Popp as well. I’m not well versed in soccer, so I’m not sure.\n[2] T/N: Apparently, it’s a famous quote from the Korean drama \"Stairway to Heaven\".",

    "content": "<Chapter 15. New Relationship - 2>\n\"So you’re saying that you intuitively sensed each other and joined forces?\"\n[That’s correct.]\nFollowing the battle’s completion, Lee Shin Woo listened to how the Pauls had fared thus far whilst collecting the loot from hundreds of undead. Honestly, there wasn’t much to speak of; it was simple. They just sensed a similar energy emanating from the Pauls that had left the city and were wandering around; as a result, they were able to group up in one place.\nThere were twenty-two Pauls who had gathered like that, and in terms of groups, there were three. He thought this might be happening in other regions of the Empire and felt somewhat strange.\n[We gathered like that, so it was about time for us to go look for General Seagald, but... we came across a battalion that was patrolling the area and we approached them because we thought they might be...]\n[They quickly realized that our energy was different from theirs, so they became hostile. Since they ordered us to go and meet their lord, as well as prove that we were truly soldiers of the Empire, we had no choice but to fight them.]\n\"The lord, huh...\"\nHe’d roughly heard about it from his seniors. The lords were individuals without much power, but were undead who experienced a special transformation that enabled them to command other undead; the undead under their direct command were incomparably powerful and quick, so apparently it would take a lot of effort to take them on. For origınal chapters go to noᴠelfire.net\nApparently, the fact that it was a huge city didn’t necessarily mean that a lord would be present, but it seems like they’d hit the jackpot.\n’Though there’s absolutely nothing to be afraid of.’\nLee Shin Woo and Jin were ridiculously strong for their level, not to mention the level 6 magician, Kratia.\nKratia couldn’t believe what was happening and directed her gaze solely at Lee Shin Woo. The Pauls seemed to think that this was their chance and asked Lee Shin Woo.\n[Who is this magician?]\n\"She came from the outside to help. She’s cooperating with me to turn the situation in the Empire around.\"\n[As expected of our Captain!]\n[You sure know a lot of people. To be cooperating with a magician who seems even more powerful than Doctor Aterran...!]\nAs always, Lee Shin Woo lied without even changing his tone of voice, and the elite skeletons marveled at him and applauded. Seeing that, Kratia completely gave up on understanding the situation at hand.\nAnd beside her, Jin looked as though he understood how she felt, as he was nodding his head. Besides, how surprised was he when he had first seen Lee Shin Woo revive these guys into elite skeletons!\n\"We were thinking of clearing out that city. I’ll lead you guys for a bit. Will you follow me?\"\n[Of course!]\n[If everyone else agrees, I’ll likewise follow your command.]\n[I feel a bit stronger just being by your side, Captain!]\nIt probably wasn’t just a feeling. In no time at all, Lee Shin Woo’s Command skill had become low rank level 3, which possessed the ability of strengthening his subordinates by just a little!\n\"Then, Shin, no... Paul Zero. Are we going to raid the city like this?\"\n\"It wouldn’t be very tough to do so, but...\"\nLee Shin Woo examined the afar wall. It might’ve been due to time, but half of the wall had crumbled and didn’t seem to evoke a huge sense of danger, but the energy coming from the swarming undead within was quite formidable.\n\"We don’t need to go the hard way when the easy way’s available to us. Wouldn’t it be stupid to attack the front?\"\n\"Then are we infiltrating the city and assassinating the lord?\"\nKratia spoke; it was a common strategy for when there weren’t many elite soldiers gathered. Lee Shin Woo uncertainly nodded his head.\n\"Yeah, we probably need to kill the lord who’s in command. If we don’t, it’ll become tough for us.\"\n\"What do you mean tough on us... ah.\"\nJin was the first to realize what Lee Shin Woo was talking about. The blue goblin fire in his eye sockets momentarily spread out lengthways.\n\"You’re really cruel. You know that?\"\n\"Thanks for the compliment.\"\n\"...?\"\nKratia tilted her head at their conversation. Lee Shin Woo brushed it aside and laughed as if it were nothing, and said something important this time.\n\"I’d like to buy the bones of the skeletons you just hunted. Is that alright?\"\n\"Bones? ...Do you have a skill that uses bones by any chance? It’s probably a skill you received from God. Perhaps your ability to alter your magic in a variety of ways and utilize it comes from...\"\n\"You’re mostly right.\"\nIt might’ve been because she was a magician, but she sure picked up on things quick. Lee Shin Woo grinned and nodded his head.\n\"I thought about hiding it at first, but I thought it wasn’t really necessary.\"\nOver the past week, they’d observed each other’s magic and conversed about skills; and in that process, Kratia had already roughly figured out what Lee Shin Woo’s ability was.\nHonestly, all Lee Shin Woo had asked for was for her to sell the bones, but hadn’t she responded in a way that was essentially saying ’yes’? He had nothing to be hesitant about, as she was thinking about whether to hide the fact that she knew or not.\n\"I’ll just give them to you for free. In exchange, let me see what that skill looks like.\"\n\"That’s not hard, but I’ll pay the price. Since it’s a reasonable price for the karma. Ah, and you guys, gather the bones of the enemies you kill, too.\"\n[Did you say bones...?]\n[Ah, I understand.]\nPerhaps it was because the Command skill was in effect, but despite it being a questionable order, the Pauls moved obediently. While they were doing so, Lee Shin Woo received all of Kratia’s bones.\nIt was impossible to price them like a proper merchant, so he paid for them with what he thought was the likely asking price. Because he had hunted down so many golems, which dropped a lot of Perium, it didn’t even really make much of dent.\n\"Then let’s pick out the level 4 knights’ bones... And you never know, so pick out a few of the level 3 bones too.\"\n\"What are you going to do with those bones?\"\n\"Bone Reinforcement!\"\nKratia asked with an excited expression and Lee Shin Woo unhesitatingly activated Bone Reinforcement before her. The Skeleton Knight’s rib bone was completely absorbed by Lee Shin Woo and its knowledge, experiences, mana and strength all flowed into him.\nOf course, since Lee Shin Woo was already level 4, he couldn’t receive many stats from the bone anymore, but his true objective wasn’t the subpar stat increase.\n[Strength has increased by 1. You have relatively perfectly absorbed the target’s memories and experiences. You have acquired a 1% skill proficiency in Horseback Riding. You have acquired a 0.3% skill proficiency in Bursting Thunder. You have acquired a 0.1% skill proficiency in Combat Sense.]\n[Oho, you dare challenge me? Hear me, you fools. If you think that I, Sir Palin, will tell you about my sexual techniques, then... - Knight Palin]\nLee Shin Woo retched at the centrally flowing memories. The knight wasn’t even trying to piss someone off, yet the most impressive memory was his talk with the other soldiers about his sexual techniques! The remaining individuals in his memory had become skeletons as well, and had ultimately fallen in vain like this; there was nothing more pitiful than this.\n\"What kind of memory was it to get you frowning like that?\"\n\"It’s nothing. It was just a sad story. You don’t need to worry about it too much.\"\n\"What the hell was that mana effect!? It was hard to understand, but I caught a brief glimpse of the magic sublimating. If I knew this was going to happen, I would’ve asked God for a skill as well...\"\n\"Hoo...\"\nLee Shin Woo took a deep breath to calm his breathing whilst more thoroughly going through the memories he’d absorbed from Sir Palin. Normally, the higher leveled the undead, the more detailed their memories were, and those memories not only increased his combat abilities, but could also provide him with information he didn’t have. Like right now...!\n’This asshole memorized all the routes to the red-light district! Because of that, he knew the ways to sneak into the outskirts of the city...!’\nThough his normal behavior was filthy, Lee Shin Woo was able to extract considerably high quality information from him. Lee Shin Woo continuously absorbed the other knights’ bones as well, and was able to ascertain where the lord lived when he was alive, as well as the positions his guards were stationed.\n’I obviously don’t know if everything’s stayed the same since they’ve turned into the undead, but it’s worth betting on.’\nIn order to supplement the incomplete information, he absorbed a few of the level 3 skeleton bones as well, and perfectly formulated the route to infiltrate into the city. Kratia marveled at him and fixed her gaze on him. It seemed as though she couldn’t completely understand the skill as she was furrowing her brow.\n\"How is this possible? You’re absorbing the innate mana within the bones in their entirety. I understand that they’re all bones, so that it reduces the potential conflict, but I don’t understand anything beyond that. I know that there’s some sort of mana disassembly process as well as a reconstruction process...\"\n[Captain, we’ve gathered the bones!]\nLee Shin Woo turned away from Kratia, who sounded like a broken record, and faced the skeletons. Each of them clutched an armful of bones to their bodies and because they hadn’t seen Lee Shin Woo use Bone Reinforcement, their voices were still inquisitive.\n[What should we do now?]\n[Are you going to hold a funeral for these guys?]\n\"Everyone, listen up.\"\nLee Shin Woo said instantly. His voice was so dignified that even Kratia flinched, so how would the Pauls have reacted? They stood upright and focused on Lee Shin Woo. However, Jin was the only one that quickly figured out what he was doing, thinking ’Ah, he’s starting to act again’.\n\"I want you guys not to hate those that you’ve killed.\"\n[But these guys attacked us.]\n[These guys were afflicted by the curse and have even lost their reasoning.]\nLee Shin Woo nodded his head weightily, as if agreeing with what they’d said, yet at the next moment, his eye sockets blazed with red goblin fire and spoke with a strong tone. Like a general.\n\"They were also soldiers and knights who cared for the Empire and respected General Seagald while they were still alive, just like you. You can’t deny them of even that.\"\n[That’s...]\n[Of course, that’s true, but...]\n\"You guys will be faced with several similar situations in the future. You’ll have to shoulder the deaths of those who were once your comrades on your backs.\"\nLee Shin Woo said, and grabbed one of the bones they were carrying. Regardless of whether he flinched or not, Lee Shin Woo placed bone on the Paul’s forehead.\n\"So, this is sign of their repentance, and represents their will as well. It’s something they’ve desperately left behind, at the moment of their deaths. ...And I can personally instill their wills into you.\"\n[How...?]\n\"Bone Reinforcement.\"\n[Ugh!?]\nThe Paul, who’d become the target of his Bone Reinforcement, shook as though it’d been shocked by an electric current. The bones it was holding rumbled and fell to the ground with a dull sound; hearing that, the surrounding Pauls took a step back in shock. However, in the very next moment...\n[H-How can this be?]\nThe Paul spoke deafeningly and plopped down. If it were human, its eyes would be flowing with tears!\n[Their will is so clear... Ugh, they truly were soldiers who loved this Empire!]\n[Hey, Paul 47. Are you ok?]\n[What exactly happened, Paul 47!]\nHearing its comrades call for it, Paul 47 raised its head and responded deafeningly once more.\n[I inherited their will. Captain revealed their will to me!]\n[Their will. The wills of the soldiers who had become undead?]\n[Our captain is definitely an emissary of God sent to save the Empire! He not only restored our minds to us, but also allows us to ruminate over those sacrificed and killed!]\nPaul 47 spoke as if touched and gathered all of the bones that had dropped onto the floor. Lee Shin Woo thought it was being unnecessarily loud, yet spoke solemnly.\n\"Now do you understand? Their wills!\"\n[Of course! Please allow me to inherit all these guys’ wills! These guys are already dead so they don’t have a will of their own anymore, but still! We’ll become one and live on!]\nPaul 47 was touched and yelled. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo saw this message in front of him.\n[The Lv3 Elite Cursed Skeleton, Paul 47 has become your subordinate. So long as you do not discard him, he will faithfully obey any order you give him.]\n[The Low Rank Command skill has become Lv4. All stats have increased by 1. You can more effectively draw out the strength of your subordinates.]\nLee Shin Woo had established a new relationship aside from the contractual one with Jin... He had formed a master-servant relationship.",

    "content": "<Chapter 15. New Relationship - 3>\n[Rather than using a sound argument, you used your actions and the mood to impress others. You lied so naturally that they weren’t even suspicious of you! The Acting skill has become Lv10. If you ’dress up’, your acting ability increases further.]\nThe moment he successfully accepted Paul 47 as his subordinate, his Acting skill naturally leveled up. Lee Shin Woo, who was neither a general or a knight of the Empire, was able to put up quite the convincing act, so it was only natural that he was able to make Paul 47, who was originally a soldier of the Empire, into his subordinate.\n’Is it at the level where I can naturally fool others, even if I don’t lie...!?’\nLee Shin Woo was impressed by his own accomplishment. Though it was a spur of the moment thing due to the favorable situation and mood, he was able to get a taste of a higher leveled skill due to its level up and the experience he’d gained was no joke! He felt overwhelmingly confident that he’d be able to lie his way out any situation!\n\"You fraud...\"\n\"Paul Zero, you’re amazing...\"\nSeeing that, Jin was amazed, and narrowed his eyes and muttered. However, it seemed Kratia was touched by Lee Shin Woo’s speech and Paul 47’s declaration as she applauded. She may be good at magic but that’s all; she was completely fooled.\n\"Will you be able to inherit their wills?\"\n[Of course, Captain!]\n\"Good. Bone Reinforcement!\"\nPaul 47 had much more backbone than Jin. Lee Shin Woo looked back at Jin and shook his head at him, as if saying ’look at him’ (Jin looked like he’d burst into tears), and repeatedly used Bone Reinforcement on Paul 47.\nThere were some of the bones he’d bought off Kratia mixed in; they were level 2 or 3 bones that wouldn’t have much effect on him, so he’d bought them to reinforce the Pauls.\n[Ugh, it feels like my body will break.]\n\"Go ahead, break! And then, be reborn!\"\n[I understand, Captain! I’ll be reborn as a new Paul 47!]\n[Please allow me to inherit their wills as well, Captain!]\n[Me too... Please allow me to as well!]\nSeeing Paul 47 being strengthened in real time, as well as inheriting the wills of the deceased knights and soldiers, the other Pauls realized that Lee Shin Woo’s words were no lie; sure enough, each of them scrambled and extended their bones forward, pestering him to reinforce them.\nOriginally, all the Pauls here didn’t trust Lee Shin Woo 100%, and some of the Pauls amongst them just thought of him as ’an ally and superior, but they didn’t need to pledge their loyalty to him’; in other words, a ’company commander’. Though there were those that had thought of him as such, that didn’t really matter anymore.\nSince to them, Lee Shin Woo was someone who loved the Empire beyond any other, and was a hero who inherited the wills of the dearly departed!\n[I feel their wills living and breathing within me. I’m Paul 101; I’ll protect the Empire, fight within the Empire, and die with the Empire!]\n\"Shin Woo, isn’t this a bit dangerous?\"\nJin was frightened, seeing the Pauls absorbing several dozens of bones in place with about half of them yelling crazily, and spoke into Lee Shin Woo’s ear. Lee Shin Woo just calmly nodded his head.\n\"Of course it’s dangerous. They’re filled with incomplete memories already and I’ve mixed in several dozens of foreign memories into them, so it wouldn’t be strange for them to lose themselves.\"\n\"Then why did you do it all at once...\"\n\"Since it’ll be easier to fool them then. Plus, it’d be helpful in planting a false sense of loyalty in them.\"\nWithin their feeble minds, the Pauls anchored themselves onto one thing amidst the flowing memories: their hatred towards the curse that had destroyed the Empire.\nLee Shin Woo had instigated that hatred, and was giving them cause to follow him blindly. It was fine if he erased all the unnecessary memories, so long as their combat techniques remained!\n\"You’re a demon!\"\n[My name is Paul 49... Henceforth, I’ll follow Captain and stake my life on reclaiming the light of the Empire!]\n\"What a great goal, Paul 49. Then, next! Paul 102!\"\n[I’m all ready!]\nIt seemed like a pseudo religious baptismal ceremony, and also the site of collective madness! The Pauls approached Lee Shin Woo in order, offering their bones; about half of them kneeled before him, and while maintaining his solemn expression, Lee Shin Woo targeted them and used Bone Reinforcement.\nAfter going through Bone Reinforcement, the Pauls who had been slightly suspicious of Lee Shin Woo acted as though they would stake everything for him instead, and the mood stunk of solemnity. Extremely speaking, it was like they were willing to forfeit the last remaining drumstick to him after ordering chicken!\n\"Are you the last one?\"\n[That’s right, Captain. Though there aren’t that many, I did kill these guys.]\n\"Oh...\"\nThe last remaining Paul was Paul 41. However, the bone that it was carrying was a masterpiece. It was a level 4 Skeleton Knight’s hand bone!\n\"You fought him one on one?\"\n[That’s correct.]\nIt may seem obvious, but each of the Pauls were born in a different environment from the others and participated in different experiments, so they each possessed different latent potential and starting abilities. They were all similarly level 3, but as there were some level 3s who possessed stats close to 400, there were also level 3s with stats close to 800.\nIf it was able to take down a level 4 Skeleton Knight, then it must be really close to an 800 stat total. Its posture was different from the other Pauls and seeing as how it waited for all the other Pauls to be reinforced before coming forward, it seemed to have a solid intellect as well. The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the nοvelfire.net\n’But what if I were to steal this bone and use it on myself?’\nIt definitely didn’t seem like a very attractive option. The opportunity cost of using the level 4 Skeleton Knight bone was much too high, as it would just provide him with subpar stat gains and experiences compared to an elite level 4 monster. If that’s the case, then... Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and raised the hand bone, placing it atop Paul 41’s forehead.\n\"Their wills will make you even stronger than before. Bone Reinforcement!\"\n[Thank you, Captain! I’ll trust and follow you!]\n[By consuming the Lv4 Skeleton Knight’s hand bone, the Lv3 Elite Cursed Skeleton - Paul 41 is being reinforced. You have made him into your subordinate.]\nBut at that very moment, a blinding light surged from Paul 41’s body. And simultaneously, the curse that covered his body was amplified and covered his entire body. (In the secret facility where the Paul 40 line of skeletons were born, they attempted to block the undead curse by steeping them into a curse beforehand; that curse was an ’aging’ curse. Since they were skeletons, they weren’t weakened by the curse.)\nIt was similar to when he had first awakened as an elite monster, but comparatively, it was a much more powerful outburst of energy! Lee Shin Woo thought that perhaps... and soon had a hunch. This guy... was leveling up right now! He had completely passed the threshold of 800 total stats!\n[Your subordinate, Paul 41, has evolved into a Lv4 Elite Doom Factor. He has learned a method of releasing the curse energy surrounding him to destroy others. The day he learns to use this to its full ability will be the day he is reborn as a true disaster.]\nWhat a cool name! It could be even cooler than a Joker Apprentice. But the moment Lee Shin Woo writhed in jealously, his own skill underwent a trivial... no, a huge change.\n[The Bone Reinforcement skill has become Lv6. You have learned how to select the best bones. When you personally defeat a monster, you can obtain two bones if you are lucky.]\n\"What...!?\"\nNormally, the moment one kills a monster, the clump of mana that cannot be reduced naturally remains as loot. Whether it be gear, bones, or skin.\nBut because his Bone Reinforcement skill leveled up, he now had a chance to acquire two bones at one time!\n’I don’t know the specifics, but I’ve hit the jackpot.’\nThe Doom Factor, Paul 41, who’d finished evolving and stood on his own, looked at him with loving eyes. He couldn’t believe that he too had black goblin fire blazing in his eye sockets and looked at Lee Shin Woo with endearing eyes.\n[This is the strength I’ve gained because of you, Captain. I pledge my loyalty to you, Captain.]\n\"Don’t pledge your loyalty to me. Instead, pledge that you’ll purify the Empire.\"\n[Captain...!]\nHis loyalty was increasing by the minute. Paul 41 seemed to have been touched and bowed his head, then Lee Shin Woo gave him another order.\n\"From now on, you’re in charge of these Pauls. You’re their commander, alright?\"\n[I understand!]\n\"Good answer.\"\nThat was the moment when the elite battalion led by the level 4 Elite Doom Factor was born. Seeing Paul 41, Lee Shin Woo formulated a new plan in his head.\nIf he could use Bone Reinforcement on the others and make them into his subordinates... if he were able to make the skeletons born from the Anti-Skull Project into his subordinates... Then, he’d have a formidable army that no one could ignore!\n’And if I were to add golems into the mix as well...’\nLee Shin Woo’s jaw creaked in satisfaction, already thinking about how prosperous his future would be. Jin thought he looked really evil, but Kratia admired Lee Shin Woo’s ability to manipulate the undeads’ feelings and instantaneously acquire their absolute loyalty.\n\"You have the qualities of a leader.\"\n\"More like the qualities of a swindler.\"\n\"I’m going to scout out and assassinate the lord, so Kratia, you stay on standby with these guys and rush in when I give the signal.\"\nLee Shin Woo, who’d completely used all of the bones to strengthen the Pauls, decided to travel incognito next. Since they had already annihilated one skeleton battalion, he didn’t know how the skeletons stationed in the city would react. It would be better if he acted before some special change occured.\n\"Jin, you’re with me.\"\n\"Ok.\"\nIt would be difficult to find them, unless they were as skilled as Kratia, if Lee Shin Woo and Jin formed a connection and moved stealthily. He didn’t need to separate from Jin just because he wanted to travel incognito. Truthfully, the Pauls were startled as soon as Lee Shin Woo got atop Jin’s back and activated Stealth.\n[Where did Captain go?]\n[Everyone, stay calm. We’ll move when we get the signal. Until then, sharpen your swords and wait.]\nBeside them, Kratia was calmly lost in thought. She had investigated the mystery known as Bone Reinforcement and was anguished over whether she could apply the same method she’d seen to her own magic. The fact that she had something to study after crossing over to this world filled her with delight.\nWhen they had gotten far from the group, Jin asked Lee Shin Woo what he’d been concerned about.\n\"Hey, Shin Woo. Are you going to bring those guys with you now?\"\n\"Nope. While it’s nice that they’ve become a usable fighting force, it’d be kind of weird to travel with them, wouldn’t it?\"\nIt might’ve been ok travelling with them when he was still alone, but it would a hassle lugging all of them around everywhere. From the start, he’d done this on a whim. He didn’t need to put too much importance on them.\n\"But if they develop well, I should be able to use them properly then.\"\n\"You’re really amazing, man.\"\n\"I know.\"\nLee Shin Woo replied coolly and activated Bone Armory, covering his entire body with armor. He equipped the helmet, body armor, and even the lower body armor; he was fully armed, aside from his weaponry. Though the appearance, as well as the materials were different for each piece of armor, equipping them all strangely made him look like a knight.\n\"You’re going to act again, aren’t you?\"\n\"Be careful starting now.\"\nWalls enclosed the city on all four sides. Of course, Lee Shin Woo naturally figured out where their guard was weakest, as he’d absorbed the knights’ and soldiers’ memories, and when they’d gotten in the vicinity of the city walls, he led Jin away from their prying eyes.\n\"How do you think they formed this underground empire? And how was it maintained... the fact that this commercial city thrived means that it independently developed several of its own industries underground.\"\n\"They probably used those amazing technical skills to build the Empire.\"\n\"Why would they go underground when they had such technical skill?\"\nOne would often forget that they were actually underground, unless they stared at the far distant ceiling.\nMoreover, there are underground areas in the Underground Empire, and the weather, as well as night and day are mostly controlled through magic. Maybe the Empire even had rivers and oceans. No, they definitely existed here.\n\"I wonder. Maybe there were too many people above ground.\"\n\"I wonder what it looks like above ground...\"\nLee Shin Woo could tell that Jin was feeling restless, perhaps because he’d met someone alive, Kratia. He could completely understand how he was feeling. He was happy that he could sympathize with him. Lee Shin Woo calmly stroked his back and comforted him.\n\"We should be able to see it someday. We’ll definitely be able to if we continue to grow like this.\"\n\"...Thanks, Lee Shin Woo.\"\n\"I’m the one who should be thankful. ...Then, shall we infiltrate the city?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nWhile they were sheltered by the low rank level 9 Stealth, the two entered into the outskirts of the city through a doghole, infiltrating into the slums. Compared to a small town filled with level 1 or 2 skeletons, the size of the city, as well as its quality were worlds apart; this was the moment that the two had entered a true undead city.",

    "content": "<Chapter 15. New Relationship - 4>\nThe city, several dozens of years following the fall of the Empire, looked truly wretched. It had only been dozens of years since, yet the sturdy bricks and cement, and the houses formed of a material foreign to them had mostly fallen apart.\nThe undead curse not only transformed living beings into the undead, but also withered away and killed anything that was still alive, so it was only natural that the city was in this state. It truly was a curse that killed the world itself. Whenever he looked at it this way, he realized how frightening the curse actually was.\n\"The other cities we’ve gone to weren’t like this.\"\n\"That’s because those cities were small. And they were on the outskirts... Since there wasn’t much in those cities, it didn’t look as bad.\"\nLee Shin Woo was definitely right. The cities they’d passed by until now didn’t have an assortment of goods, but this unknown city, possessed huge walls, a commercial district, as well as a slum area.\nThere were streets leading to the houses, a city hall, as well as traces of various people in different places trading with each other. It wasn’t just leftover goods; there were also traces of people.\n[The weather’s great. It seems like it’ll rain soon.]\n[Ha. Did you hear that the Lord is coming to visit this street today?]\nThe only undead they’d met before entering the city had been an undead battalion in the middle of patrolling, but after entering the city, their surroundings were littered with undead.\nIt might’ve seemed obvious, but just because it was a danger level 2 zone didn’t mean that there were high level undead everywhere. Rather, most of them were level 1 undead. They didn’t really have any special features and the only piece of information that appeared was [Lv1 Skeleton]. If they were still human, they probably would’ve shown up as [Lv1 Human].\n[Haha, that costs 3 Perium. I can’t give you a discount.]\n[That’s too expensive. Then throw in that small one, too.]\n\"...How is this possible?\"\nJin had forgotten that they were travelling incognito and spoke stiffly. Lee Shin Woo could understand how he was feeling. That’s because the skeletons were haggling over a valueless rock.\n\"They’re repeating what they did when they were still alive. The lower leveled the undead, the more the rely on their instincts...\"\n\"... I was looking forward to it a little bit.\"\nJin, who realized that speaking a little louder wouldn’t release Stealth, spoke bitterly.\n\"I may just be speaking nonsense as the skeletons you’ve made into your subordinates abandoned their still ’alive’ general and decided to follow you as their Captain, but in any case...\"\n\"They’re acting based on their own will.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nOne couldn’t say the Pauls’ conditions were normal either. But despite being tricked by Lee Shin Woo, they definitely understood that they had become skeletons and moved accordingly. Just that was enough to make them look ’normal’.\n\"I’ve restored their egos and even give them a name; I really am like their savior.\"\n\"No, that’s not what I’m saying.\"\nJin denied him right away. At the beginning, he wondered why Lee Shin Woo had set the skeletons free, but he’d ultimately turned them into his subordinates once they seemed like they would be useful!\nLee Shin Woo’s fickleness was truly frightening. The only thing he was sure of was that Lee Shin Woo would always be true to himself. It felt a bit awkward thinking about it any further, so he decided to change topics.\n\"...Is killing them the only way to save them?\" Fresh chapters posted on NovєlFіre.net\n\"Don’t misunderstand. They’re already dead. Even if you talk to them, they probably don’t even remember their names.\"\n\"Then what about us? We’re undead, too.\"\n\"We can say our names. That means we’re not dead.\"\nIt sounded quite simple, but there was a much more complicated meaning within that statement. Whenever Lee Shin Woo would say something like this, Jin would admire him a bit, but he didn’t really want to accept that Lee Shin Woo had more knowledge or wisdom than him when he was already stronger than him as well, so he didn’t say it out loud.\n\"There’re a lot of level 1s here, but it’s not a danger level 2 zone for nothing. The closer we get to the center of the city, the more tightly-guarded it’ll be, so focus on your connection with me.\"\n\"Mine’s at Beginner Lv7, so it won’t be tough for me.\"\nOf course, Jin didn’t have the ability to learn Stealth, but while going through a few small towns, they discovered a rural rat nest dungeon; Lee Shin Woo gave Jin all of the rat bones, and as a result, he was barely able to learn Stealth. Both of them knew the same skill, so it was easy to raise the effectiveness of his skill through their connection.\n[Through the connection from the Horseback Riding skill, the Stealth skill’s effectiveness increases. In special situations, the skill proficiency rapidly increases.]\nLee Shin Woo and Jin took the opportunity and escaped the notice of the two skeletons, who were stuck in the past, and slowly went around the city like ghosts. The shadows cast by the ruined buildings easily concealed them, and they observed the city, as if they were memorizing every facet of it.\n\"We shouldn’t even worry about the level 2 ones, right?\"\n\"They’re at least level 3 elites over here. We don’t need to count them if they’re not even level 3 elites.\"\nNo matter how strong they were, they wouldn’t be able to handle overwhelming numbers. That’s how Lee Shin Woo had thought in the past. However, that was something that only applied to Earth. Even if thousands of level 3 golems came rushing at him right now, he was confident that he could take them all on without even breaking a single bone.\nThere was the fact that there was an overwhelming disparity between their stats, but also because undead possessed the special characteristic of never physically tiring.\n’And that’s also the same for skeletons, as well.’\nBut that also meant that there was a high possibility that he would be helpless against a higher leveled undead. Those were the ones that Lee Shin Woo had to find and kill first.\nOf course, it wouldn’t have been too difficult for them to just straight up attack them since they had the level 6 magician, Kratia, but since she would reduce their contribution, they had moved quickly.\n’Honestly, I wanted to take my time and look around, as this is the first city that seems big enough to be called a city.’\nThey had pretty much finished up clearing the outskirts of the Empire, so now it was time to deal with the danger level 2 zones. It wasn’t a bad idea to go through the cities and ascertain their levels while they still had the assistance of a level 6 magician. Though of course, each city would have their own specific circumstances...\n’There are a lot of knights. There’re at least ten skeleton knights above the walls, and there are five knights that periodically go on a patrol. And there are thirty of them on standby in shifts inside of their private barracks...’\nIf a hero were acting alone, they would likely feel terrified at around this time. Because they only had one life, they wouldn’t have been able to boldly infiltrate the city like Lee Shin Woo, and they wouldn’t even dream of attacking the city by themselves.\n’It would definitely be impossible for a level 4 hero, and even if they were level 5... It would only be possible with a few level 5 heroes.’\nLee Shin Woo suddenly realized why heroes preferred going through dungeons. The cities were huge and difficult to kill undead popped out in various areas. On the other hand, monsters popped out regularly in the dungeon, and would provide a more definite reward, so it was the much more attractive option.\n[Shino Rendu: Even though it’s a danger level 2 zone, it would still take more than a year to fully clear it with a few people. Take down the high priority targets first, and then look for the right opportunity to take down the rest. Remember, Lee Shin Woo. Your life is most important.]\nShino Rendu was the most hot-blooded amongst his seniors and even he spoke like that. So he could understand why his seniors grew so slowly. He could even understand why they cheered whenever they discovered a dungeon...\n\"Shin Woo.\"\nLee Shin Woo heard Jin’s voice and then froze too. When he, who had been lost in thought, raised his head, he understood why Jin’s voice was so stiff.\nIn an area slightly askew to the city’s center square, and in front of an imposing mansion above a sloping road, there was giant monster roaming around... No, it was a golem. It wasn’t just a normal golem either. It boasted a height of around 4 meters, and its imposingness seemed unshakable...!\n[Lv5 Iron Golem - I0918 (Elite)]\n\"A level 5 golem...!?\"\nAs he thought, after the Bronze Golem was the Iron Golem, the one he was most worried about. It had only gone from level 4 to level 5, yet why did it suddenly seem so upgraded; when he thought about it, the difference between level 4 and 5 was like the difference between the heaven and the earth, so he could roughly understand too.\n\"Shin Woo, you haven’t seen it yet, huh. The golem’s not the problem.\"\n\"No, it is a problem. Why is the golem living in a place outside of where it was produced... no.\"\nLee Shin Woo was speaking and then stopped, groaning at his stupidity. Why were the golems created from the very beginning? It was probably to protect the Empire.\nOf course, after the fall of the Empire, the several golems didn’t have a place to go and were abandoned, but until then, the manufactured golems were probably sent to various regions in the Empire! And that golem was one of them.\n\"There’s something controlling that golem.\"\n\"Something controlling it!?\"\nLee Shin Woo was shocked. And despite yelling in shock, his Stealth wasn’t released; that fact shocked him even more! What’s worse, at that moment, his skill leveled up!\n[The Low Rank Stealth skill has become level 10, and evolved into the Intermediate level. You do not possess the talent to covertly kill your opponent, but you do possess the ability to move secretly and quickly. You have learned the Intermediate Shadow Sprint skill. Agility and Magic have increased by 10. The higher the skill level, the lighter the shadow.]\n’I lost Combat Sprint and gained Shadow Sprint....’\nHow ironic. Moreover, he could use this skill in tandem with his connection with Jin to draw out its full ability, making it a truly effective skill. Lee Shin Woo was satisfied by the result that came out from his negligence and smiled. Jin called out to him with a cold voice.\n\"If you’re done checking out your skill, then could you start checking that guy now?\"\n\"Ah, my bad.\"\nHe scratched his hairless head and looked at the area that Jin had pointed at. It was the mansion’s balcony, and he could see the undead that stood at the balcony. It was a level 5 undead, and it was none other than the lord, the [Skeleton Commander]! And gripped within its emaciated finger bones, there was...\n’A core...?’\nIt felt as though he’d received a blunt impact to his head. That’s right. They couldn’t control the golem’s mana on the outside, so they would instead control the core that produced their mana! Lee Shin Woo had never enlisted the aid of an object to help him radiate his mana, so he’d never thought about it before.\n’But is that the only option available?’\nIf the core could change even an undead’s mana to that of a golem’s, then wouldn’t there be no reason that he, who had absorbed the golems’ magic knowledge and everything, couldn’t do the same?\nHadn’t he been thinking about this too complicatedly? Guillotine Steelworker might have caused him to tunnel vision on his statement, that none other than the golems could create that seal, and had approached the matter in a much more complicated way than needed. It was time to start fresh.\n\"I feel like I’ll be able to know for sure after killing that guy and examining the core...\"\n\"Hold on, Shin Woo. The Shriek of the Dead doesn’t work on golems.\"\n\"...Yeah, that’s a good point.\"\nThey could only see one outside, but considering how they could feel the same quality of mana within the mansion, there weren’t just one or two golems. They didn’t know if they could take care of the golems quickly, and if they factored in the concentration of knights nearby the mansion, it would be best to retreat.\n\"...Yeah, I got it. Let’s give up on killing the lord first. Let’s start at another place. Just not here.\"\n\"That’s a good idea.\"\nThere were several sections of this city that they hadn’t checked yet. Lee Shin Woo and Jin completely backed off from the lord’s mansion in order to perfectly conquer the city without injury.\nForty minutes later, horrific screams resounded through the city. The battle had just begun.",

    "content": "<Chapter 16. A Joker is Born - 1>\nThe shriek resounded clearly across the city, alerting them that the battle had begun.\n\"This city is ours (Pauls) now! Throw down your weapons and surrender!\"\n\"Do you really have to say that!?\"\n[By using Low Rank Shriek of the Dead, the enemies in the entire area fall into a frenzied and fearful state.]\nLee Shin Woo’s booming voice echoed throughout the entire city. However, rather than throw away their weapons and surrender, their enemies that heard him rampaged about and blindly thrust their weapons at each other’s heads. Obviously, whenever he utilized Shriek of the Dead, its effect would be the same, regardless of what he said.\n[Kyahaaaaaahk!]\n[Kihik, when did so many undead invade the city!?]\n[All knights, draw your swords! Teach those undead how heavy a sin it is to trespass on the Empire’s sacred soil!]\n\"Just one shout caused the city to go from peaceful looking (at least on the outside) to a complete mess...\"\n\"As I thought, it would be easy for a high leveled Treasure Eater to wreck a city like this one if it were drawn here.\"\nDid Lee Shin Woo rush into battle right after shouting? Of course not. The main focus of this mission was to ascertain how many high leveled undead there were, as well as their location.\nHe had divided the city into sections, based on how many high leveled undead there were, and had been moving around as he calculated the effective area of his Shriek of the dead.\n[I’ll engrave the Empire’s laws into your body!]\n[How dare you, a mere undead! You wicked black magicians; I’ll make you kneel before the Emperor!]\n\"Whoa, these knights here fight well.\"\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo had predicted that there would be some who wouldn’t be affected by Shriek of the Dead, but that didn’t matter. Since even the level 4 Skeleton Knights were affected by his level 6 Low Rank Shriek of the Dead.\nNormally, it would be difficult to achieve this good of a result with a low rank level 6 skill, but Lee Shin Woo’s Mana Bone skill was helping. Any act that utilized magic would be buffed by Mana Bone, but it was particularly effective on abilities that changed pure magic and utilized it.\n\"Let’s move quickly, before the lord intervenes with his own golems and knights!\"\n\"I know already! We’ll arrive at our next position shortly!\"\nThey had travelled incognito around the city for upwards of two hours, and they had already picked the spot where he would use Shriek of the Dead. After they confirmed that the spot was safe, they immediately moved to the spot and Lee Shin Woo used Shriek of the Dead for a second time.\n\"Ooaaaaaaaaaaahk!\"\n[Evil puppet!]\n[You should be in Hell. Why have you come outside!?]\nThere weren’t any Skeleton Knights in that area, but a huge concentration of soldiers instead; he was extremely satisfied with the chaos that spread instantly. If one were to look at the city from above, they would see Hell.\n\"Good, let’s go to area C now!\"\n\"I’m the devil, the devil...!\"\nThe plan was progressing smoothly. Since the undead were fighting amongst themselves everywhere, Stealth... No, Shadow Sprint was released and he was exposed to the world to see; despite that, none came to attack Lee Shin Woo or Jin.\n[The Low Rank Shriek of the Dead skill has become Lv7. Magic has increased by 3.]\n\"Nice, the skill’s leveling up quickly, too.\"\n\"...Shin Woo, I feel like they’re on the move now.\"\n\"Ok, I’d expected that they’d start to move about now.\"\nThe ones ’on the move’ described the Undead Commander’s group atop the hill. Regardless of how dull he had become after transforming into an undead, he was still the lord; Lee Shin Woo didn’t think the lord would sit still while there was chaos spreading throughout various areas of the city.\nBut in order to delay him as much as possible, Lee Shin Woo had been focusing on the faraway areas in order; obviously, it seemed as though the lord had decided to intervene before they could finish up.\nImmediately after hearing Jin’s report, Lee Shin Woo heard a screeching sound from afar. The Iron Golems were moving.\n’What should I do? Will my acid mist be able to melt them?’\nLee Shin Woo briefly pondered on the subject and shook his head. Even if he focused all of Melting Bone Double Axe’s power in one place and exploded it, he wasn’t confident that he could defeat an Iron Golem in that way. That’s because each and every one of those Iron Golems were elites.\n’There are four of them. And the one controlling them is a level 5 Elite Skeleton Commander. There are three level 5 Elite Skeleton Elder Knights guarding him, as well as twelve level 4 Skeleton Knights...’\nImposing monsters were guarding the lord, proving that he was the lord for anyone who didn’t already know. Rather than fighting them straight up, calling upon the group that was on standby would be cleaner and safer. It probably would be, but...\n\"But it’s also worth a try.\"\n\"Weren’t you the one that said we’d be giving up on fighting the lord? You’re still out of it, aren’t you?\"\nJin scolded him and was about to move to the next area. Since their original plan was to go to as many spots as possible before the lord earnestly decided to intervene, use his Shriek of the Dead to cut down the number of knights and soldiers, as well as evade the blindly rampaging swords and arrows, and then get back outside.\nThere were more than 10,000 level 2 or higher undead within the city, so it would be foolish to fight them one at a time... Lee Shin Woo, who’d said that himself, was for some reason patiently looking towards the direction of the lord’s troops.\n\"You...\"\n\"...Jin, there are times when a person needs to take a risk.\"\nEven though Jin knew that Lee Shin Woo’s heart was set, he retorted in a weak voice.\n\"You’re a skeleton, though.\"\n\"For me, that time is now!\"\n\"...God.\"\nFor some reason, he knew that he would take that risk. He couldn’t just let an opportunity like this slip away; he couldn’t help but want to fight against a higher leveled enemy, an elite one at that. Maybe this was proof of being ’Lee Shin Woo’. But even so, Jin thought that Lee Shin Woo’s symptoms were a bit more severe than usual, as he was willing to face off against that assorted gift set of level 5s. Jin quietly asked.\n\"You just don’t want that girl to steal your experience, right?\"\n\"Yep.\"\nHe was way too honest. Lee Shin Woo belatedly added.\n\"And if I fight against the skeleton using the core to control the golems and experience it firsthand, I may be able to get a feel for changing my mana into that of a golems’.\"\nLee Shin Woo then de-equipped his lower body armor. At the same time, he summoned the Drake Horn Lance!\nThe appearance of that imposing weapon screamed that they were right here, as if it were an electric signboard advertisement. The mana within, as well as the high rank of the weapon drew the attention of even the rampaging undead.\n\"Hooo...\"\nHe learned how to wield the weapon through the memories of the knights he’d absorbed until now, as well as Bursting Thunder, which encompassed all weapon arts. He grabbed the lance in his left hand, firmly positioning it between his arm and armpit.\nHe called this method ’Couched Lance’ and though he would have to abandon the lance upon collision, it wasn’t much of a problem for him since he could just make another one.\n\"Let me get a bit used to it first.\"\n\"Kill me now... It’s on you if you die!\"\n\"That’s my partner!\"\nUltimately, Jin made his decision, instantaneously changed directions and ran. Indeed, he plowed through the center of the city with a speed akin to lightning! There were some in the middle who blocked them, but they soon disappeared. He didn’t even have to dirty his Drake Horn Lance with their bone powder as Jin broke through them with his steel covered body.\nThe sharper and sturdier Jin’s body, the less things would interfere with his running. And because of that, he could run even faster than before. Jin wasn’t a Skeleton Horse right now, but rather seemed like a longer and sharper lance than the Drake Horn Lance!\n’It was a good idea to learn Steel Body. Since I love running without anything in my way... Fast... Faster! The fastest in the world!’\nJin truly began to run faster and faster. In the span of time it took to a blink a few times, they had reached the center of the city from the outskirts. They had already come close enough that they could see the lord’s group on the move!\n[The Drake Horn Lance is increasing the effectiveness of all charge related skills by 40%.]\nThe faster Jin ran, the more red light the Drake Horn Lance emitted. Its splendid option of increasing the effectiveness of all charge related skills by as much as 40% would catalyze the mana within and appear. Lee Shin Woo more firmly grasped the spear and his goblin fire blazed.\n’I definitely have to take care of at least one of them with this.’\nWhen he factored in his stats that had surpassed a level 4’s and neared a level 5’s, Jin’s destructive power through his speed, and the Drake Horn Lance, which would boost all of that to its maximum while possessing its own destructive power, it would be unlikely that even a level 5 elite monster would survive an attack.\nNo, they had to die. Because if they didn’t kill their opponent, they would have to cope with the force following the moment of impact in its entirety. In any case, their charge attack had to kill one of them.\n’You see the biggest golem in the centermost area, right? I’m going for him.’\n’Alright.’\nHe stuck to Jin’s back as much as he could and maximized their connection. At this point, they didn’t really have to say things out loud. Whatever he thought of was naturally transmitted to Jin, and Lee Shin Woo could roughly figure out what Jin wanted as well.\nFrom the start, one of the reasons that Kratia had been interested in them was because of the assimilation phenomenon that occurred through their perfect connection, a connection so perfect that it was almost strange. Though she didn’t know much about the skill itself, she did say that other Horseback Riding skills didn’t develop the way theirs did. And that was being proven right now. ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ novel{f}ire.net\nIt wasn’t just a simple connection between a man and a horse; it was something only possible between them because they were both undead heroes and the connection was beginning to bear fruit!\n[The Low Rank Horseback Riding skill has become Lv10 and evolves into the Intermediate level. You have formed a truly deep connection with your riding companion, and gone past the union between man and horse.]\n[Attuning your will with your companion and adding their strength to your own is no longer a skill but can be considered to be in the realm of magic. You have learned the Intermediate Assimilation skill. Agility and Magic has increased by 10.]\nLee Shin Woo felt it when he gained the skill. The moment he used the two skills that had evolved in this battle, Shadow Sprint and Assimilation, to their very limit, he realised that he and Jin could reach unknown territory!\n’Shin Woo! Soon!’\n’I know!’\nHe’d only just acquired the skill, but the Assimilation skill’s ability was clear. Before Jin had even transmitted his intent, he could figure out what Jin wanted!\nThe two had already gotten really close to the lord’s group. Obviously, their enemies noticed them too. However, they didn’t worry about that. Since at this very moment, there was no one here who could respond to their speed!\n[Hostility detect...]\nLee Shin Woo and Jin frontally crashed into the golem they had decided upon beforehand, and at that moment, they matched their breathing.\nWithin their minds, they drew a clear picture. The world ground to a halt, as if they had pressed a temporary pause button on Jin’s overwhelming speed; Jin’s speed in its entirety was contained within the lance, and the lance would break through the golem. That image!\n\"Uorayaaaaaahp!\"\nLee Shin Woo yelled a strange battle cry and raised the mana throughout his entire body. He gripped the spear, and the instinctually applied mana, containing the power of Bursting Thunder, rushed towards the end of the spear. The deep blue mana was added to the red energy and the two mixed together, forming swaying violet sparks!\n[The Low Rank bursting Thunder skill has become Lv10 and evolves into the Intermediate level. Strength and Magic has increased by 10. Low Rank Power Slash is absorbed. It has become possible for you to incorporate lightning into your weapon.]\nAs per the saying ’even when it’s rotten, it’s still a herring’ the Iron Golem realized that Lee Shin Woo attacked before he did, and twisted its body around in an attempt to somehow reduce the damage it would sustain. At the same time, it also deformed its body in an attempt to attack them as well, so they could safely say that it was a truly impressive response.\nHowever, to Jin, no, to both him and Lee Shin Woo, who he was assimilating with, it looked much too slow. They had already seen that in their ’image’ and were able to overcome it.\n[Critical Hit!]\n[Hieruwakbedakuru] [1]\nThe moment the extended lance struck its target in one area, the golem emitted a sound that he couldn’t understand at all.\nAnd then, the golem broke apart and its pieces flew everywhere.\n[1] T/L: Gibberish.",

    "content": "<Chapter 16. A Joker is Born - 2>\n[You achieved the feat of executing a higher leveled (elite) foe. Strength has increased by 10. Skill proficiency in Bursting Thunder has increased.]\nLee Shin Woo watched as the Iron Golem scattered into pieces in front of him (or at least, where it was) and couldn’t even react. That’s because the recoil at the moment of impact was too much for them to handle. Follow current novels on novèlfire.net\nAt the very least, the lance broke apart at the moment of impact so the recoil was dispersed as much as possible. If it hadn’t, Lee Shin Woo’s arm bone or Jin’s leg bone would’ve broke. It was definitely an absurdly powerful technique, but without coming up with a proper countermeasure, it was unusable.\n[Who are you? If you’re a knight of the Empire, how dare you not recognize me... there’s no way you’d fail to recognize who I am and do something so wicked!]\nIt seemed as though it couldn’t help but be shaken after watching one its most powerful forces get destroyed so quickly, as the Skeleton Commander yelled in a quivering voice.\nAs expected, it possessed a clear ego, perhaps due to being level 5, but it inevitably couldn’t remember its own name! When Lee Shin Woo became aware of that, he instinctively yelled.\n\"Do you really not know why I’m here?\"\n[I-I don’t know...!]\nThere was no way it’d know. If there were some special reason, Lee Shin Woo would like to know himself.\nHe just spoke whatever came to mind and circulated his mana to help him and Jin cope with the accumulated shock. Surprisingly, Mana Bone, which circulated the mana, could be applied to Jin through the Assimilation skill. It truly was a cheat skill.\nHowever, he was slyly lying to the Skeleton Commander even while being astonished by how far his skill had developed.\n\"Bah. There should be a reason you can think of. We’re not dispatched just anywhere.\"\n[D-Dispatched...!? Were you perhaps sent by the imperial family? L-Look here. Stop attacking for now. Stand by! I said to stand by!]\nHuh? He’d just haphazardly said that to buy time for them to heal, but their reaction was much better than he’d expected. While the lord was flustered, Lee Shin Woo collected the loot with a relaxed posture without giving anything away and even approached the lord, dragging Jin with him.\nThe golems acted like obedient hunting dogs, and when they heard the words ’stand by’, they immediately stepped back; on the other hand, the knights looked uneasy and were unable to easily approach.\n[You have acquired 17,500 Perium.]\n[You have acquired a Deteriorated Original Bone Core.]\n’Oh.’\nAs expected, the drops changed at around level 5. He felt as though they were being way too stingy with the Perium for an elite level 5 monster, and despite the Original Core being ’deteriorated’, it was still an Original Core!\nHe was extremely satisfied and raised his head. Lee Shin Woo saw the lord’s hand not leaving the core, even while flustered, and was impressed; he then decided to put out a feeler.\n\"So are you going to talk now?\"\n[I... I haven’t done anything wrong! They offered it to me first! I wanted to leave the underground!]\n\"...\"\nHearing the lord’s unexpected response, Lee Shin Woo was momentarily speechless. What the hell is this senile skeleton even saying? They offered it to me first? He wanted to leave the underground? This wasn’t just some common corruption from a noble, but something a lot bigger!\n\"Still... that doesn’t lessen your crimes.\"\nLee Shin Woo strived to not let the confusion show on his face, and had to try really hard to adapt to what the lord was saying. Just because a skeleton’s face didn’t change didn’t mean that there was nothing else to do. He had to prevent himself from being quiet for too long, or speak with a flustered tone, or even control the pattern by which his goblin fire swayed.\nIf he interrogated him for a bit longer, it seemed like he’d be able to learn something new. Perhaps it would be about the relationship between the underground empire and above ground!\n[...You’re not, huh?]\nHowever, despite Lee Shin Woo acting with his entire body, the Skeleton Commander had somehow figured him out!\n[Yeah. If you were the Golden Shadow, then you wouldn’t have destroyed a golem! You’re not! You aren’t! Who the hell are you!]\n\"Shit!\"\n[Ugh!?]\nHe didn’t know where he’d gone wrong, but it was pointless to continue acting after he was caught. Before the lord, who had figured him out, could retreat, he quickly stretched out his hand and stole the lord’s core. It was only possible because the lord’s close combat abilities seemed fairly low!\n[Die!]\n[We won’t let you touch the lord!]\n\"Tch!\"\nThe moment he’d reached out his hand, the Elder Knights came at him from both sides. Fortunately, because Jin acted quickly and retreated, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t cut by their swords filled with tumultuous death energy.\n\"What the hell were you thinking, you idiot!\"\n\"Sorry. I went overboard thinking that I’d found some kind of hidden quest or something...\"\n[Catch him! Take the core back!]\nThe lord, or rather the Skeleton Commander, shrieked, and the three level 5 Elite Skeleton Elder Knights, as well as the twelve level 4 Skeleton Knights charged at Lee Shin Woo all at once.\nAt that moment, a bizarre black light surged from the Skeleton Commander and was absorbed by the knights; Lee Shin Woo could see that their mana was being amplified. It was a special Command type skill!\n[The lord has given us his command. I’ll bury my sword in his heart!]\n[How dare you put your filthy hands on one of the lord’s possessions!]\n\"Tch...!\"\nThe Skeleton Knights attacked quickly, as if the lord had increased their strength by 50%, and made it so that Lee Shin Woo and Jin were busy running away. If Lee Shin Woo were alone, he would’ve just given up an arm to the oncoming swords in all directions.\n[How is it that we can’t take down that one guy! Why can’t we hit him when he’s right in front of us!]\n[Connection with commander has been lost.]\n[Standing by.]\nHowever, the golems didn’t respond to the Commander’s shrieks. He was certain that the lord couldn’t issue commands without the core. Lee Shin Woo decided that that’s where his hopes lie.\n\"What do we do? Do we run first?\"\n\"No. We’re ending it here! If that bastard goes outside and starts getting set up, we’re screwed.\"\n\"Ah, damn it!\"\nEven while matching their breathing, and dodging the incoming swords tinged with death energy by hectically moving their bodies around, Lee Shin Woo yelled confidently. At the same time, he concentrated on the core that he’d swiped from the lord.\nOf course, the core had transformed into bone the moment he’d stolen it from the lord, but grasping the original flow of mana within wasn’t difficult.\n[Limited Order Bone Core]\n[With your superb analytical skills and knowledge, you recognized that this is a transformed Original Core. The Original Core records a person’s mana, and when that mana is injected into the core, it is changed to a particular frequency, enabling you to order the registered entities, I0918, I0919, I0920, I0921.]\n[In the process of changing into bone, the original commander’s registration has been erased. It is unknown whether the core will activate normally.]\n’In other words, the core registered the lord’s mana and locked it so that only he could use it, and it also possesses a lock that enables him to control all of the golems here. Fortunately, one of those locks have been released...’\nAnd the only ones who could tamper with that set-up were level 7 golems like Guillotine Steelworker. Lee Shin Woo suddenly thought the system of manufacturing golems in the Empire was messed up.\nSo how tough would it be to control all of the golems without a core? While being vaguely frightened of doing so... at the same time, he couldn’t help but feel happiness welling in a corner of his heart.\n’I came here for a change of pace to take my mind off of the administrative seal, yet I found a crucial part here. I hadn’t believed in it before, but I guess fate does exist.’\nWith Jin’s help, Lee Shin Woo was able to avoid the Skeleton Knights’ attacks and while moving extensively, infused his mana into the Limited Order Bone Core.\nOf course, it didn’t go so well at first, and after repeatedly trying to activate it as its previous registration hadn’t been erased, it seemed as though he had finally satisfied some sort of condition as the bone core began to radiate light. At that moment.\n[Recognizing new commander.]\n[Receiving orders.]\nThe golems hadn’t been a part of the unfolding chaos, and were on standby in a separate location, yet they suddenly spoke. Lee Shin Woo suddenly clenched his fist since it had gone as he’d planned, but the lord, the Skeleton Commander was extremely taken aback.\n[H-How can you use the core when you haven’t gotten their permission...!? You’re worse than the Golden Shadow!]\n\"As I thought, since you’re an undead, you’ve lost a lot of your common sense. Umhp!\"\nWhether he could properly use the core or not would decide the outcome of the battle; Lee Shin Woo was well aware of that, so focused on the core. It seemed as though the Skeleton Commander had likewise realized that fact.\n[You have to kill him quickly and take back the core!]\n[The lord has commanded us! Bring some of the soldiers over here. Where are the soldiers!?]\n[Damn! If I had my horse, I would’ve have to suffer so much from that skeleton horse!]\nThe things the Skeleton Knights were saying were becoming laughable. Lee Shin Woo continued to infuse mana into the core and fixed everything that came from the transformed Original Core into his mind.\n’Yeah, that’s right. The answer’s inside here. If I study this, I’ll get the basic idea. The way to control the golems without a core, as well as how to create them with mana!’\nLee Shin Woo’s realized that his intent and how much mana he infused would determine what part of the core reacted, as well as how it would change the mana; he also realized how that transformed mana would be transmitted to the golems, as well as how the golems would move through that transmission.\nIt would normally take a few months before he was proficient, but to him, who’d already acquired a general administrator’s seal, this kind of mechanism was easy for him. He could control them as easily as if he were moving his own body, no... it was actually more simple to do than that! As a result.\n[Eliminating enemy.]\n[Result of searching for mana. There are reinforcement troops in the back. Executing them first.]\n[T-This is...!]\nInstantaneously, the three Iron Golems became the skeletons’ enemies, and the Skeleton Commander was mixed with both feelings of anger and panic, so he didn’t know what to do.\nThe Skeleton Commander raised his hand, as if he were preparing an offensive spell, but he then lowered his hand since he didn’t want to damage the golems; he was definitely thinking of killing the trespassers as quickly as possible and retaking the core.\n[Protect the lord!]\n[But we have to kill the trespassers...]\n[The lord takes priority! You guys take care of him!]\n[I understand!]\n[You guys, y-you can’t destroy the golems!]\nWhile the Commander was hesitating, the Elder Knights hurriedly took on one of the Iron Golems each and the level 4 Skeleton Knights continued to fight against Lee Shin Woo. What a turn of events!\n\"I was waiting for that!\"\nLee Shin Woo acted as if he’d been waiting for that very moment, wielding the Lightning Tooth in one hand and the core in the other, sweeping through the skeletons. It was a superb showing of multitasking.\n[Kuaaaaaaahk!]\n[Kihek! M-My lord...!]\nRegardless of how much stronger they’d become from the Commander’s skill, most of Lee Shin Woo’s main skills had grown to the intermediate level, and was a monster close to level 5.\n[The Lightning Tooth is strengthening Bursting Thunder. Your lightning becomes stronger.]\nAs Bursting Thunder reached the intermediate level, the Lightning Tooth could finally show its true strength; blue lightning streaked across the Lightning Tooth and spewed out onto his enemies, suppressing them. Whenever he struck with his sword, which they couldn’t even see, the skeletons’ skulls and ribs would break to pieces, scattering everywhere!\n\"It’s quite simple.\"\n[H-How is this possible...!?]\nThe three Iron Golems and Elder Knights were fighting against each other as all of the level 4 Skeleton Knights had instantly been annihilated. There was no one left to protect the lord!\nThis had all happened within the span of 5 minutes after he’d swiped the core that controlled the golems from the lord. The lord couldn’t believe this at all.\n[Listen up. It’s fine if you destroy the golems. We have to stop that atrocious cheater!]\n[M-My lord...!]\n[Ugh!]\nWhen the lord realized that Lee Shin Woo didn’t really care if the stolen golems were damaged or not, he urgently called out to the Skeleton Elder Knights, but it was already too late.\nFrom the start, Lee Shin Woo had desperately sought to steal the Iron Golems as they were solid, tough and powerful elites! Even if they were indeed strengthened Skeleton Elder Knights, they weren’t able to take on an Iron Golem 1 on 1; what’s worse, they had been ordered to not damage the golems, so the Elder Knights were put on the defensive and couldn’t move an inch.\n[Damn it...! Where are the other soldiers and knights!? Where the hell did they go!?]\n\"You’ll be able to meet them soon.\"\nLee Shin Woo controlled the golems and hectically drove the Elder Knights into a corner; Lee Shin Woo simultaneously steered Jin and instantly came within distance of the Commander. At that moment, the Commander’s jawbone clattered and chanted something, causing mana to collect in the air. He was trying to cast a spell. However...\n[Shock Missile!]\n\"I heard that commanders double as magicians as well. I also heard that they’re jam packed with magic, but they don’t have any internal stability.\"\nThe spear he’d created with mana was easily split apart by the blue sparks rising from the Lightning Tooth. If he took it straight up, it might’ve hurt, but that’s it. That’s because he wasn’t a magician specialized in magic, but completely specialized in commanding only.\nSeeing that, the Skeleton Commander babbled that he was wielding a treasure unfitting of a thief and so on and so forth, but Lee Shin Woo obviously didn’t concern himself with that.\n\"Single Lightning!\"\n[No!]\nA single strand of blue lightning from the air shot down onto him. This technique was both the alpha and the omega of Bursting Thunder; following the lightning strike, he would quickly slash with his sword!\nAs Bursting Thunder reached the intermediate level, its true potential was unlocked; this sword strike may be an extremely basic technique, but it was as imposing as divine punishment.\n[Ugh...!]\n\"Heup!\"\nHe might’ve had some trick left up his sleeve as Lee Shin Woo felt like he heard him clattering, but Lee Shin Woo just intensified the mana and thus the lightning. Ultimately the Skeleton Commander screamed awfully and disappeared. He had been completely destroyed, as if a gust of wind had passed by.\nThe Skeleton Commander’s floating skull blazed with goblin fire as if cursing him, but soon was consumed by the flames and vanished.\n[You have achieved the feat of defeating a higher leveled enemy. All stats have increased by 1.]\nThe Lightning Tooth burned the air, emitting an intense ozone smell. It was pointless to ask at this point, but how could he smell again? Lee Shin Woo thought trivially and withdrew his sword.\n\"We have to take care of the others quickly.\"\n[H-How dare you kill the lord...!]\nA little while later, a fine, but certainly recognizable flaming pattern could be seen from above the city. The Pauls and Kratia, who seemed to have just been waiting for his signal, immediately entered the city... and were soon able to see it.\nThe city, which Lee Shin Woo had turned into a scene more horrific than any Hell.",

    "content": "<Chapter 16. A Joker is Born - 3>\n[Kill him! Kill them all!]\n[For the Empire!]\n\"You said you’d just kill the lord, but what is this...\"\nKratia completely froze the wall, ascended to the top, and just stood dumbstruck after confirming the massacre. The skeletons were hostile to everything and everyone. It started from the level 4 Skeleton Knights to the ordinary level 1 commoners; all of them had equally fallen into madness.\nAt this very moment, she heard a jarring, hair-raising scream from somewhere, but Kratia thought that it was a voice she’d heard somewhere before.\n\"Do the undead periodically fall into madness? No, there’s no way that something could happen so suddenly... Then was it Shin Woo? But how?\"\n[The Captain’s ordered us to annihilate them! Let us put to rest those foolish and pitiful fools of the Empire!]\n[Follow the Commander!]\nThough Kratia stood petrified, the Pauls followed behind her into the city, and unhesitatingly rushed forward.\nThe elite squadron, led by the reborn Paul 41, the level 4 Doom Factor, didn’t have even a shred of hesitation and cut apart all of the surrounding undead. They had already finished steeling themselves.\n\"What could he have done to these guys? How...? Ugh.\"\nKratia couldn’t get over her doubt at all, but it felt like a waste of time to do so while just sitting there. Ultimately, she stopped mulling over trivial thoughts and went straight into a large scale spell. After seeing Lee Shin Woo’s use of mana, she’d developed a new technique; she’d made up her mind to test her ’catalyzed magic’!\nA large quantity of mana stuck to the ice artifact that floated before her; Kratia watched as a large amount of mana grew, and smiled.\n[The Low Rank Shriek of the Dead skill has become Lv8. Magic has increased by 2. Your skills are affected by your mana and can persist for a longer period of time.]\n\"Whoa, what’s that?\"\nMeanwhile, Lee Shin Woo had finished cleaning up the area, and was using Shriek of the Dead in various areas of the city; he gaped once he saw the spell Kratia had cast.\nThere was no way an occupant of the city wouldn’t be able to see the spell; there was an absurdly large mass of ice floating in the air!\n\"Ooh, it’s cold just looking at it.\"\n\"The cold’s not the issue here.\"\nThe clump of ice floating within the air created a suction force that drew in the surrounding mana; this mana seemed to rotate around the ice and then, transformed into sharp ice spears. And those ice spears poured down upon the enemies everywhere!\nHe could describe the clump of ice that so slowly advanced into the air, as well as the following ice spears that poured onto the battlefield as ’horrific’. To the point that Lee Shin Woo thought that he didn’t even need to separately take out the Skeleton Commander if she could use something like that to attack the entire city!\n\"What kind of huge spell is that?\"\n\"Are all level 6s like that?\"\n\"No way.\"\nBut when he considered the fact that Kratia hadn’t been in the Empire for very long and was still a newbie hero, he was just speechless.\nLee Shin Woo hadn’t expected to influence her to to the point of completing such a grand magic; he decided to be even more guarded against the other heroes from now on. Of course, there was nothing wrong with being careful. He then realized that he hadn’t been aware of how amazing he was.\n\"If you get hit by that, would you die Shin Woo?\"\n\"Yep. Fortunately, it seems avoidable, but... No, it doesn’t seem like we’ll be enemies with Kratia, so we don’t need to go into hypotheticals here.\"\nOne week was more than enough time to figure out each others’ tendencies. Kratia was only single-mindedly focused on magic, but was also a rational thinker, as well as loyal. He thought she was a trustworthy human.\n\"I don’t think I’ll have to make a move with that there. Let’s rest.\" Check latest chapters at NoveI[F]ire.net\nAs soon as Lee Shin Woo decided that the battle was over, he immediately sank down onto the ground.\nHe grasped the Limited Order Bone Core in his hand. It was the key that would control the Iron Golems that stood before them. They had some spare time now, so he decided to earnestly start studying the core.\n\"That’s what you call resting?\"\n\"We should be able to get to level 5 if we use all of the bones we’ve acquired from the battle. So, I want to finish the quest before I level up.\"\n\"You’re so stubborn it’s scary.\"\nLee Shin Woo could already use the Bone Core much better than the original owner, the lord, could. Considering the fact that he had controlled three Iron Golems simultaneously and made it so that two of the Elder Knights couldn’t move an inch (while wielding the Lightning Tooth in his other hand and swinging it at the final Elder Knight), Jin was just shocked!\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t satisfied with just that.\n\"Arema Steelworker... No, the Empire made a huge mistake. If you hold the remote control, it becomes really obvious how the golems’ mana is created, as well as how they move, doesn’t it?\"\n\"If anyone could tell that from just analyzing it, they wouldn’t have made a remote control like that...\"\nRegardless of how deep one’s magical knowledge was, or how much they analyzed the basics behind it, they wouldn’t be able to copy the mana. At least, if they followed what Kratia had told them. However, Lee Shin Woo was gripping the Bone Core and struggling against it, so he didn’t hear what Jin was saying.\n’That’s right. Originally, mana doesn’t have its own form. The form changes depending on who is using it. ...In some ways, it might be similar to my karma.’\nLee Shin Woo closely examined the process that changed his mana within the core, and was repeatedly in awe. It felt like he had tested and confirmed the knowledge he’d memorized until now, and was deeply moved. He also felt a sense of stubbornness, that he wanted to do what the core did all by himself.\n\"Hoo. Then let’s do it in order.\"\n\"It’s surprising that you’re doing this in order.\"\nHowever, it was impossible right now; for starters, Lee Shin Woo focused on giving out detailed commands to the golems. There were basic commands recorded in the core, but he wanted to personally inject his will into the golems based on the strange mana pattern change.\nThis wasn’t very difficult, as he had already received all the knowledge from the Original Core.\n[Following order. Running in place.]\n[Following order. Sparring with I0921.]\nHe had succeeded, so next up was to transmit the image in his head in its entirety to the golems. The core had just become a medium that changed Lee Shin Woo’s mana into that of a golem’s. he had already completely analyzed the core and successfully produced their effects.\nHe was even soon able to release the ’limited’ clause on his administrative authority. In other words, he would be able to control golems below level 5, even if they weren’t registered in the core. This was already a shocking achievement, but he wasn’t satisfied with that.\n[Executing pushups.]\n[Executing 8 personal training exercises.]\n\"I’m almost there...\"\nLee Shin Woo gently closed his eyes. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that he was the one who knew about a golem’s mana most, aside from a golem itself. He just needed to take one more step.\nHe trusted in mana’s ability to change. He had absorbed a golem’s mana before, so he thought that there was no reason he wouldn’t be able change his mana to that of a golem’s. Lee Shin Woo was now able to genuinely think that way.\n\"Hoo...\"\nLee Shin Woo fell into deep thought, and he dropped the core that had been in his hand, which automatically entered his inventory. If he truly wanted to produce a golem’s mana, he had to discard the core. [1]\n[Standing by.]\n[Connection with commander has been lost.]\nThe golems, which had been diligently doing their pushups and eight PT exercises, returned to standby. It was possible because they weren’t the autonomous defense type golems, which automatically recognized their enemies and attacked.\n’A golem’s mana... A golem’s mana...’\nHow long had he stood there? Around the time where he became unaware of the chaos and the terror that covered the city, mana suddenly appeared on his fingertips.\n\"Oh... Oh?\"\n\"Hoo...\"\nIt seemed as though the mana couldn’t make up its mind, as it hovered around, but it soon changed into flames, acid, and lightning. The mana went from a living person’s to a dead person’s.\nThen it changed to Lee Shin Woo’s mana, to something else’s, and ultimately arrived at unknown territory. He realized that all of it was similar and that there wasn’t any real reason to classify them.\nThe moment he thought that way, the mana within him seethed. The Mana Bone skill responded to his realization and more purely refined his mana. Though there wasn’t any change in the volume of mana, this had caused his mana to be reborn.\n[The Element category has been opened in the status menu. You can draw the pure essence of the elements from your mana and use them as you please. The Low Rank Flames of Revenge and the Intermediate Acid Poison Spray skills are eliminated. You have acquired Low Rank Fire Lv4, Intermediate Acid Lv3, and Intermediate Lightning Lv1.]\nThe Flames of Revenge, as well as the Acid Poison Spray skills were nothing more than skills that changed mana for a special purpose and allowed one to manipulate the transformed mana. Compared to fundamentally changing mana into a pure element, the skills were inferior techniques.\nHe had become able to freely change his mana into an element and use it, whether he wanted to cause it to spread and persistently blaze, or shoot out in a straight line. Lee Shin Woo then realized that there was no reason to confine flames or acid into one form.\n’Yeah. That’s what Kratia realized as well when she watched me...’\nThe purpose of Bone Reinforcement wasn’t for him to learn typical skills from absorbing the memories of countless individuals, as well as their abilities, but to make him realize that he could combine countless abilities into one, or divide one into countless others.\n\"Hoo...\"\nThe black mana above the palm of his hand unraveled like a ball of yarn and formed a single pattern. If the Steelworkers had seen that, they would’ve been shocked. That’s because it was the high rank administrative seal that was only allowed to level 7 golems.\nThis was the result of Guillotine Steelworker’s arrogance; he thought that only golems could create the seal, so he didn’t even feel the need to hide the pattern.\n[Recognizing high rank authority.]\n[It’s a pleasure. Obeying Steelworker’s orders.]\n[Output limitations have been completely released. High rank commander is cleared.]\nThe three golems quickly stood up. If they had treated his commands as though they were from a lieutenant until now, now they were treating him as though he were a 2-star general and were showing their loyalty.\n[Accepting Iron Golems I0919, I0920, and I0921 as subordinates. These golems are under the effect of the Command skill and are strengthened.]\nJin, who had watched with bated breath ever since Lee Shin Woo had created several elements, realized that Lee Shin Woo had really done it and was shocked. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo saw a message right in front of him stating that Kratia was finished!\n[Quest complete! You have acquired 3 permits to God’s secret shop. The Acting skill has become Lv11. You have learned the Joker’s innate skill, ’Disguise’.]\n[Disguise Lv1 (Active)]\n[A true Joker fools even himself. And if he perfectly fools even himself, then he can ultimately fool the entire world. You can transform into someone you are completely familiar with, or modify a part of your body or an item you are holding. Of course, it only changes the outside appearance, so please use this skill with discretion.]\n\"...!?\"\nLee Shin Woo felt as if he had goosebumps all over his body. How could this kind of skill exist? He could understand if it were a skill that allowed him to create something with mana, but this wasn’t like that.\n’Fool yourself, so you can fool the world?’ It sounded way too grandiose. Even he, the possessor of the skill, couldn’t understand the principles behind the skill. He had finally finished his homework, yet it felt like he had gotten another more difficult piece of homework.\n\"What’s wrong, Shin Woo? Were you not able to make the seal just like you wanted?\"\n\"No, that’s not it.\"\nLee Shin Woo just shook his head towards Jin, who was worrying about him. He had thought that everything would be his for the taking after figuring out how to make the seal, but was crestfallen when he realized that wasn’t true, and wasn’t able to honestly relay that fact.\nAt that moment, Lee Shin Woo suddenly felt the death energy around him dwindle. Now that he thought about it, he didn’t hear any screams or battle cries in the surrounding area anymore. That meant only one thing.\n[You and your comrades have cleared away the death in the city, ’Kehebe’. Though you did not eliminate the curse, you managed to lessen the energy of death here, so no more undead will appear in this area.]\nIt was message saying that they’d purified the city.\n[1] E/N: Not to be thought of literally. He just shouldn’t be in contact with the core for it to truly be him making the changes.",

    "content": "<Chapter 16. A Joker is Born - 4>\n[You have acquired 2 permits to God’s secret shop. You have acquired 10,000 Perium. Proficiency in combat-related skills has increased. You can now use your own private chatting channel.]\nIf heroes clear out a city of the undead, they receive a reward personally bestowed by God. He’d seen everything else before, but the private chatting channel was a surprise. Of course, it was questionable how much he would use it in the future.\nIf a hero performs exceptionally in the task known as ’purification’, they may be awarded a Hero token; however, Lee Shin Woo had already obtained the Joker karma, so he couldn’t obtain it a second time. No, perhaps the purification process was much too wicked, such that he wouldn’t have been able to attain it, even if he didn’t possess the Joker karma.\n[You have gathered more than 10 permits to God’s secret shop. You may exchange 10 permits to God’s secret shop for 1 permit to God’s garden.]\nHowever, there was an additional message that appeared before him. It was the first time he’d seen a message like this. Lee Shin Woo stared vacantly at the message for some time, and then silently opened the chatting channel. He had decided that this was something that he should know about beforehand.\n[Mr. Lee Shin Woo has entered.]\n[Ye Jin Jin: I’m glad you’re safe!]\n[Lee Shin Woo: I’m glad you’re safe as well. Seniors, have any of you gone into God’s garden before?]\n[Prince Altania: You crazy bastard. How the hell did you collect ten permits to God’s secret shop?]\n[Ye Jin Jin: You shouldn’t talk like that! That makes it sound like Mr. Shin Woo is crazy!]\n[Lloyd H.K.: He is crazy. How did you collect ten of them already?]\nAs expected, it seemed as though his seniors knew about it. If it was something they hadn’t heard about before, he wouldn’t have gotten any information out of them; instead, they would’ve pestered him like crazy and it would’ve been a real pain in the ass. It was a relief that that wasn’t the case. He quickly asked them a question.\n[Lee Shin Woo: I was just lucky enough to get them. What should I do with them?]\n[Yasunori Akira: A small blessing. That’s what we call it. Even I haven’t gotten one before.]\n[Ethan Cruz: God’s garden is a kind of temple. Though it’s a bit pricey to get in, God will personally bestow upon you her divine grace, which is well worth the cost.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: We’ve heard about it from Ethan [1], but we’ve never actually gone there before. Since we need to continuously go into the secret shop, we couldn’t just continue gathering them.]\n[Erian Ruparte: Lee Shin Woo, I’m envious of your talent and passion. I thought you were out of the ordinary ever since you rescued Jin Jin, but...]\n[Lee Shin Woo: It was all because of her. You see, I received a lot of permits for God’s secret shop from saving her.]\n[Prince Altania: Ah, maybe I should do some manual labor too. At this rate, I’m afraid I’ll fall behind a newbie. That would be such a disgrace.]\nHe wanted to say, ’You might’ve already fallen behind Kratia already’, but Lee Shin Woo barely kept himself from saying it. And his seniors’ advice continued on.\n[Seira Von Retadane: We have to periodically go to the secret shop since we can’t just fill our inventories with food. Lee Shin Woo, you’re probably well aware of this, but you cannot afford to be too greedy. Please enter God’s garden only after you have enough permits to spare or after you have acquired a quest that’s easy to complete.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: Thank you, senior. I’ll keep that in mind.]\n[Prince Altania: As I thought, Seira’s been to God’s garden before. It’s really clear advice.]\n[Seira Von Retadane: Please call me Retadane.]\nIn any case, Lee Shin Woo didn’t need to eat, so essentially, it would only be beneficial for him to go to God’s garden. He thanked and said goodbye to his seniors who always gave him good advice, and left the chatting channel. But then...\n[Ethan Cruz: I have high expectations of you, Lee Shin Woo. Perhaps we’ll meet soon.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: I’ll work hard.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: For Ethan to say something like that...]\n[Prince Altania: Senior, you can’t say stuff like that. I’m close to level 7, you know? Once I get to level 7, I’ll go through all the dungeons I know about, and get to level 8 in a flash! Ah, Lloyd, if you ask me sincerely, I can help you out.]\n[Ethan Cruz: Prince, you’re extremely talented as well. I just didn’t say it since it seemed so obvious, you rascal.]\nLee Shin Woo stepped away from the exchange of well-wishes between seniors and juniors and left the chatting channel. But unexpectedly, at that moment, he saw two messages appear simultaneously.\n[Mr. Ethan Cruz is requesting a private chat.]\n[Ms. Ye Jin Jin is requesting a private chat.]\nWas this message appearing because he’d unlocked the private chatting channel function? Lee Shin Woo accepted Ethan’s request first. In no time, he heard Ethan’s voice in his ear.\n[It wasn’t lip service. Lee Shin Woo, you’ll become a big shot in no time.]\n\"Um... thank you.\"\n[It’s important to know just how much you’re worth. I hope I didn’t see wrong. It’s nice to be humble, but remember that you can’t afford to fool yourself. Be aware of how special you are and proceed steadily.]\nWhy was this guy saying such burdensome things? He should’ve just refused, just like Arema Steelworker had done with the golems, but Ethan eventually went on to the main topic.\n[I’m a high level right now, so I don’t really need them, but there are a few dungeons that only I know about.]\n\"Pardon me...?\"\nEven an idiot would understand what Ethan Cruz was saying. However, that made him all the more suspicious of him.\n\"Did you want to tell me about these dungeons...?\"\n[Exactly.]\nObviously, the higher level the dungeon, the more difficult it is to find. These dungeons are hidden in more unusual places and trick adventurers. That’s why heroes go crazy whenever they find a dungeon. However, he knows about a few dungeons? And was only going to tell Lee Shin Woo about them?\n\"There are other heroes, so are you really ok with telling me?\"\n[Ah, Lee Shin Woo. I just told you, didn’t I? I told you that you’d become big. ...You’ll be different from useless bums like the Prince.]\n\"...I see.\"\n[I’m glad you’re quick on the uptake. Now then, I’ll activate the minimap sharing function.]\nSharing the minimap. This feature would share one’s location with another person. Apparently, it was the feature that was unlocked following the private chat function, so it felt strange to Ethan Cruz that Lee Shin Woo hadn’t unlocked it yet.\n\"It feels like the image has been stuck into my head.\"\n[You roughly know what direction you need to go in, right?]\n\"Yes, thank you.\"\nIt felt similar to opening the world map in a game, marking one’s destination, and moving towards said destination. To put it simply, a navigation system for a car. If he closed his eyes, an arrow would appear in his head that would indicate which direction he should go in.\nAll of the dungeons Ethan had told him about were situated in the same area. They were quite far off, but if he used the train, he could get there quickly, and even if he didn’t have access to the train, he could get there riding Jin at top speed in only three weeks; if he just walked there, he could get there in a year.\n[I hope you grow quickly. Since you can’t invade the capital all by yourself.]\n\"Thank you... very much. I hope I’ll be able to stand side by side with you one day.\"\n[Superb.]\nThat ended their private chat. Immediately after, Lee Shin Woo stopped acting and thought about it. What the hell is this piece of shit planning?\n\"Are there heroes who kill other heroes to grow...? Then does God just sit by and allow that to happen?\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\"There’s an asshole, one of our seniors who’s trying to lead me somewhere. 100%.\"\nHe knew since he was in the same line of business (swindler). Ethan Cruz was 100% a son of a bitch. But compared to Lee Shin Woo, Ethan’s means were quite sloppy.\nFor example, all of the dungeons he’d informed him about were in the same direction. A prominent figure like Ethan Cruz... no, a hero who’s been at this for a long time wouldn’t have just stayed in one place like that, so does it make any sense that all of the dungeons he’d told him about were in the same place? It was definitely a trick clearly aimed to lead Lee Shin Woo to a special area.\n\"Couldn’t it just be that he found a ton of dungeons that weren’t fit for his level after leveling up a lot and moved to another area? It’s not good to be so distrustful of people, Shin Woo.\"\n\"No, my ’s.o.b. radar’ is going crazy right now. I thought it was strange that I became a rising star or whatever just by introducing myself in the chatting channel.\"\n\"But you are a rising star... Even from my point of view, you’re so talented that it’s strange.\"\n\"You know pretty much everything about me, but the problem is that the other heroes don’t.\"\nEthan Cruz’s objective was so clear, but he didn’t know what his motive was. What good was it to kill another hero? Rather, he should get a penalty from God, so why...?\n’Mm... I guess I could just meet with God and ask her myself.’\nLee Shin Woo thought, and around the time he felt relaxed, he got another private chat request. Of course, it came from Ye Jin Jin. As soon as he accepted, he heard a lively girl’s voice in his ear.\n[Ye Jin Jin: I’m sorry if I’m disturbing you! But I have something that I really needed to tell you.]\n\"It’s because I got another private chat request.\"\n[Ye Jin Jin: Who!? Is it Ms. Retadane? It shouldn’t be Erian [2]...]\n\"Ethan Cruz.\"\n[Ye Jin Jin: That senior...!? Ah, that’s right. I recently unlocked a new function. I’m here right now.]\n\"Here...?\"\nHe waited, figuring that she might have unlocked the sharing function, and as he expected, the minimap sharing function activated. Of course, he could’ve refused, but didn’t; funnily enough, she was in the complete opposite direction to the point Ethan Cruz had marked.\n[Ye Jin Jin: I’ll work hard to catch up to your level, so let’s hunt together in a party later!]\n\"Yeah, sure...\"\n[Ye Jin Jin: Then I’ll get going now! I’ll get back to hunting!]\nLee Shin Woo listened to the cheerful Ye Jin Jin until the very end and couldn’t help but suddenly recall what his seniors had told him. ’Take it easy on the romance...?’ There’s no smoke without fire, but perhaps... no.\n’No way.’\nIf one likes a skeleton, then they were either really screwed up in the head, or became a skeleton themselves. Now that he thought about it, both of them were pretty much the same.\nLee Shin Woo unhesitatingly interpreted Ye Jin Jin’s feelings for him as just trust. Or perhaps respect. If it was either of those, there was nothing wrong with her. It was fine to have those kind of feelings for a skeleton.\n\"Shin Woo! What the hell did you do!?\"\nThen, Kratia came flying by and landed in front of them. Beyond her, the Pauls were moving diligently to collect the bones. Lee Shin Woo marveled at the fact that they did it without him ordering them to do so. These guys were truly starting to show promise!\n\"I just used a skill. It doesn’t work on allies, so don’t worry.\"\n\"If you just let me see you use that skill... No, wait a sec.\"\nKratia was soon greeted with a sight that was much more surprising than the Shriek of the Dead. She had discovered the three Iron Golems that stood side by side around Lee Shin Woo, as if guarding him. There was no way she, with her magical abilities, wouldn’t be able to figure out what kind of relationship Lee Shin Woo had with the golems.\n\"You, this... Perhaps...?\"\n\"Yep.\"\n\"Let’s increase the duration of the contract!\"\nAs soon as Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and acknowledged her, Kratia’s eyes brightened, as though there were stars in her eyes. It was the most beautiful and lively face he’d seen since meeting her. However, Lee Shin Woo replied sharply and firmly, like a slap to the face.\n\"Don’t want to.\"\n\"Ugh...!\"\nLee Shin Woo, who had already achieved his objective, didn’t really need to hang out with her any longer. But Kratia, who had witnessed yet another miracle from Lee Shin Woo, couldn’t let him go so easily; Lee Shin Woo ultimately agreed to increase their contract by just three more days.\nIn exchange, all of the bones of the undead that she killed would go to him, and... they forged another alliance.\n[1] T/N: He never actually uses Ethan’s first name to address him, but using ’senior’ here wouldn’t work.\n[2] T/N: Uses the Korean term \"unni\" to describe Erian here. Women use this term to refer to women older than them that they’re close to or their real sisters. In this case, it’s the former. ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ novel·fıre·net",

    "content": "<Chapter 16. A Joker is Born - 5>\nLee Shin Woo had never leveled up as planned. But this time, he was somehow able to prepare for his level up at his leisure.\nHis accumulated stats from both his achievements and the evolution of his skills totaled 1,598; in other words, he was only 2 stats away from a level up, and there were a ton of bones here that he could use to increase his stats.\n\"Jin, what about you?\"\n\"I’m at 1,574.\"\n\"Good. You should be able to level up too.\"\n\"You want me to increase my stats by 26 all at once...!?\"\nJin said in shock, but Lee Shin Woo didn’t listen to him. He was just reacting like that because he was so happy. Even if Jin didn’t think that way himself, that’s how it was.\nThe city was extremely vast, and the amount of knights protecting it was considerable. However, due to Lee Shin Woo, Kratia, as well as the Pauls, not even one skeleton was missed and the city was completely cleared; therefore, with the quantity of bones they’d gathered in one spot, they could raise their stats by more than 26, and could even go up to 50 if they wanted.\n\"Pick out the bones level 4 or higher.\"\nThere were about 100 level 4 bones. Most of them were from knights, but there were occasionally some magicians’ bones mixed in as well; Lee Shin Woo decided to invest those magicians’ bones into Jin. Aside from his agility, everything else needed work, but Jin especially lacked in the magic department.\n\"And this too.\"\n\"Ugh...\"\nNaturally, Lee Shin Woo held out the Original Bone Core. He had some cores remaining after using them on the deteriorated Original Bone Core. The cores kept adding up, and soon, he managed to make another one. Lee Shin Woo, who had been prepared to sacrifice the Limited Order Original Bone Core, felt relieved that he wouldn’t have to.\n’Jin’s been avoiding this thing.’\nBefore joining together with Kratia, they actively cleared out the golems in the outskirts of the Empire and had managed to accumulate several Original Bone Cores. However, most of those went to Lee Shin Woo. Not only was Jin afraid of absorbing them, but Lee Shin Woo also thought that it was urgent he got stronger asap.\n\"But I really can’t get any stats out of these Bone Cores anymore. It’s better for you to absorb them, if you consider their efficiency.\"\n\"Damn it... Fine.\"\nThe same types of bones fundamentally possess a similar karma. There was even a limit on absorbing skeletons’ bones, which possessed a special characteristic based on the individual, so there was no way that golems, which were carefully thought out and produced, would be any different.\nThrough hard work, Lee Shin Woo had already acquired all the stats he could from the Bone Original Cores, and now it was Jin’s turn. It seemed as though Jin realized that he couldn’t get out of it this time, and calmly assented. Since it wasn’t his first time experiencing it, he didn’t break down.\n\"Urgh...\"\n\"Tell me when you’ve got it.\"\n\"Ugh... I got it. I just need to raise my stats by 8 more.\"\n\"8, huh. Ok.\"\nYeah, it was fortunate that Jin was headstrong. Lee Shin Woo nodded in satisfaction and continuously used the magicians’ bones on Jin. Whenever he did so, Jin would flinch, but he managed to bear with it quite well. He maintained his connection with Lee Shin Woo, and remembered the days he had endured, which helped him get through it.\n\"Hoo... Just 3 more stats.\"\n\"Just one more level 5 bone should be enough then.\"\nLee Shin Woo examined the level 5 bones he’d collected from the battle. First were the four bones he’d gotten from the Elder Knights. There were four, including the three Lee Shin Woo had killed, as well as one that Kratia had killed.\nThere were two more level 5 bones as well; they were the lord’s, the Skeleton Commander’s, skull and rib bone. He was lucky to have gotten them through Bone Reinforcement’s new option.\n\"Which one should we go with?\"\n\"It doesn’t really matter to me, so just pick one already. I’m ready.\"\nJin spoke in a pointlessly grim tone, and stiffly raised his head. Lee Shin Woo chuckled and picked the Skeleton Commander’s rib bone. Because it was the only one which would increase health.\n\"And if I’m right, it’ll probably...\"\n\"Probably what?\"\n\"You’ll know if you experience it firsthand. Bone Reinforcement!\"\n[Bone Reinforcement is being implemented on Jin Taylor by consuming a Lv5 Skeleton Commander’s rib bone. Health has increased by 1. You share a portion of its memories and experiences.]\n[A defensive seal? If there comes a time when I have to use that, then my family line will end on that day as well. - Nameless heir]\nThis time, Lee Shin Woo received 1 stat point and only need one more to level up. Of course, Jin obviously got more than 3 points from it. Suddenly, a dreary black light burst from Jin’s body; it was an outburst of mana that indicated that he was leveling up. Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs novel※fire.net\n\"Ugh...!\"\n’Is it because of the contract? I feel a bit strange, too.’\nIt felt as though Jin’s nausea was transmitted to Lee Shin Woo in its entirety. He calmly stepped back and observed Jin’s level up. Kratia also watched with interest.\n\"It seems much more intense than a human’s level up. Is it because he’s leveling up to 5?\"\n\"Is there something special about level 5?\"\n\"Yeah. It’s the level where your karma pieces, which are divided into several branches, are made one, and for the first time, your true path is decided. Level 5 is the level where you are considered high rank.\"\nKratia added that she became an ice magician at level 5, so she was forced to walk on that path from now on.\nAfter hearing that, when he thought about it, Lee Shin Woo had acquired the Avenger karma at first, then the Trickster karma, and several other karmas as well, but all of these were gradually sorted out; now, his promotion to a true Joker was right ahead of him, so he thought she wasn’t exactly wrong.\n\"Ah, it’s almost over.\"\nThe dreary black light wrapping around Jin gradually disappeared, revealing the vastly changed Jin from within. The first thing he noticed was his frame; it had a metallic sheen to it.\n\"I was probably really affected by Steel Body. Besides, I don’t really have any other active skills.\"\nNo one had asked, yet Jin preemptively explained. The blue blazing goblin fire in his eye sockets had also intensified as well.\n\"And from the absorbed bone, I got a skill that’s like a lifesaver. The moment I get hit by an attack, it creates a magical shield that nullifies a portion of the damage; it’s truly a vague skill.\"\n\"As I thought, it’s the skill that the Skeleton Commander used at the end.\"\n\"Then shouldn’t you have gotten this skill? After all, you wind up in dangerous situations more often than me...\"\n\"And what ended up happening to the Skeleton Commander who used that skill?\"\n\"...\"\nHe died. The aforementioned skill was a lifesaver in unforeseen situations, but it wasn’t suited for a warrior who fought on the frontlines.\nTherefore, Jin, who acted like a war horse, would be better served learning the skill, and it would lessen the chances of him getting hit by an unforeseen attack that would take him out of the battlefield.\n\"You know, I heard that as you indirectly telling me that my body’s really weak, so I should take care of myself...\"\n\"I’ll tell it to you straight up. If you don’t like it, then let’s train some more.\"\n\"Ugh!\"\nJin became level 5. His stat effectiveness should’ve gone up, so his monstrous speed should’ve gotten even faster. Therefore, he would need to properly control that speed, as well as possess a skill that protected his body.\nJin also understood that Lee Shin Woo’s was looking out for him and didn’t say anything more. He pledged that he would try hard to more naturally utilize Steel Body, as well as the skill he just obtained.\n\"It’s your guys’ turn next.\"\n\"We’ve been waiting.\"\nThe Pauls had distinguished themselves in battle. Frankly, the reason that Lee Shin Woo, Jin, and Kratia were able to move separately was because the Pauls had taken down the skeleton commoners, as well as the soldiers neatly and quickly, which were so numerous that they would’ve been a hassle to deal with.\n’When I look at it this way, it makes me want to bring them along with me...’\nHowever, he couldn’t. Considering their mobility, it was correct to just leave them be. If for no other reason, it was important that he reinforce them now.\nTruthfully, he thought about ignoring the cost and just selling the bones at the secret shop, but most of them were from ordinary, non-elite monsters, and he remembered that he would have to sell them at a comparatively low price compared to buying them, so he decided against it.\n\"Let’s reinforce the one’s close to level 4 first. I don’t know how much stronger you could get, but...\"\nThere were bones amassed in front of him. The Pauls stood side by side, as if indicating that they could endure whatever came their way; Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and raised a bone.\nLee Shin Woo had already ground the level 1 skeleton bones into medicine, yet funnily enough, there were more than 10,000 bones remaining that were level 2 and up. He then spent the time listening to their screams for a tedious three hours.\n[Lv4 Doom Factor - Paul 102]\n\"I did it, Captain!\"\n\"Yeah, good job.\"\nAs a result of investing all of level 2 and level 3 bones into them, more than 10 of the Pauls leveled up to level 4.\nLee Shin Woo thought that their paths would differ as they absorbed different bones, but he was wrong. All of the skeletons who had become level 4 became Doom Factors. They obtained a higher level of strength than before, and those who hadn’t leveled up were envious of them.\n[I want to grow too...!]\n\"Then you need to hunt more. It seems like I’ll be in this general area for a bit, so hunt strong monsters however you can and bring the bones to me. I’ll reinforce you guys with them.\"\n[I understand!]\n[Thank you, Captain!]\nSurprisingly, they departed immediately. Immediately, without even telling him when they’d meet again! He was pleased that they showed such an unbelievable desire to improve for undead, but... ultimately, he just shrugged his shoulders. It was unlikely that they’d return in just ten days.\n\"Then is it your turn now, Shin Woo?\"\n\"It’s dangerous, so take a few steps back.\"\nKratia was excessively inquisitive. It felt as though she would bite off his hand bones and eat them if it would help in figuring out Lee Shin Woo’s magic. After Lee Shin Woo had commanded the golems to protect him from a bit far away, he gathered the rest of the bones in one spot. With an equal amount of level 5 and level 4 bones.\nRoughly speaking, he didn’t think he would get a new skill. On the bright side, he had the Skeleton Commander’s skull, so he felt like it would at least improve his Command skill. He’d learned so many skills, and now most of them were starting to overlap.\n\"Hoo... Bone Reinforcement!\"\n[Implementing Bone Reinforcement by consuming all of the gathered bones. Strength has increased by 13, Agility by 11, Health by 14, and Magic by 5. The Low Rank Regeneration skill has become Lv7. The Low rank Command skill has become Lv8.]\n[You have become level 5. All stats increase by 20. Your inventory has doubled.]\n[You have become able to control the elements themselves. You may be an undead, but you are a pure undead, unaffected by the curse, so you have evolved into an Elemental Skeleton!]\n[You have become the world’s only Joker. No one can control your karma, and whatever you decide to become, it is your choice alone.]\nThe transformation wasn’t as intense as he’d expected. Compared to when he had become level 4, where all his equipment was absorbed and his stats increased sharply all at once, it didn’t feel like much of a big deal simultaneously absorbing a dozen bones and leveling up.\nIt felt like there was much more tension back when he’d figured out how to make a high rank administrative seal since he hadn’t been able to recreate it for so long... he felt strangely disappointed, but Lee Shin Woo examined his body, and soon realized what a huge misunderstanding he was making.\n\"This is... it’s worlds apart.\"\nHis magic and strength condensed within his body, further enhancing the health and mana that has been accumulated in his bones. It seemed the more the Mana Bone skill developed, the more his health and magic would balance out, due to its ability to contain mana.\nAnd now that he was level 5 and his body was completely restructured, that became apparent even from the outside. His hard work starting from level 1 was reflected in his current body, so he felt deeply moved.\n\"Ooh... Your build’s completely different now. Shin Woo, you really look like a boss mob right now.\"\n\"You look as if you’re level 6 or 7.\"\n\"You’re one to talk. You know how absolute the difference between levels is.\"\nLee Shin Woo snorted and replied to Kratia, and took a brief deep breath.\nThen he checked his stats.",

    "content": "<Chapter 16. A Joker is Born - 6>\n[Lee Shin Woo]\n[Elemental Skeleton Joker]\n[He who Conquers the Impossible; 2 other titles]\n[Lv - 5 (Status effectiveness 170%)]\n[Strength - 397 Agility - 376 Health - 372 Magic - 577]\n[Passive skills - Acting Lv11, Invisible Heart Lv3, Low Rank Avenger Lv2, Intermediate Bursting Thunder Lv1, Intermediate Mana Bone Lv1, Intermediate Shadow Sprint Lv1, Low Rank Command Lv8, Intermediate Assimilation Lv1, Intermediate Combat Sense Lv4]\n[Active skills - Disguise Lv1, Bone Reinforcement Lv6, Rule of Bone Lv4, Bone Armory Lv2, Low Rank shriek of the Dead Lv8, Low Rank Regeneration Lv7, Sacrifice Lv1]\n[Elements - Low Rank Fire Lv4, Intermediate Acid Lv4, Intermediate Lightning Lv1]\n[Resistances - Holy: MAX, Curses: MAX, Acid: Low Rank Lv9, Ice: Intermediate Lv2]\nLee Shin Woo looked vacantly at his dazzling status and then asked Jin with a vacant voice.\n\"Jin, is your status effectiveness also 170%?\"\n\"Yeah. It seems like that’s the same for everyone.And when you get to level 6, it becomes 200%.\"\n\"So the gradually increasing effectiveness increases even further, huh.\"\nHe could outright say this. This world wasn’t set up such that a lower leveled individual could beat a higher leveled individual. Lee Shin Woo suddenly regarded him beating the level 5 Treasure Eater when he was still at level 3 as a miracle.\n’Is it even possible to beat a level 6 opponent? You can only reach level 6 by accumulating 3,200 stats and the effectiveness of one’s stats are even increased by another 30%... There’s way too much of a difference.’\nEven if he factored in Jin, who at least doubled his fighting strength, it was the same. He wasn’t confident that he could defeat Kratia if they were far off from each other. Especially when he considered the power of the catalyst magic she’d cast just recently.\n’Is Bursting Thunder and the reinforced elements my only shot? Those would increase the ’level’ of my magic and if I were to add Rule of Bone to that, the ’level’ of my physical abilities would increase as well; with that, I would be able to inflict an injury at the very least. The reason I was able to take down an Iron Golem in one shot was because of those two abilities.’\nThe power to overcome the handicap of levels; various skills were united as one, and evolved. In the end, these few skills had gotten to a level that could be called ’authorities’. Lee Shin Woo could safely say that he was ahead of all the other heroes in this regard. He suddenly realized what a huge blessing it was that he acquired Bursting Thunder from defeating the Zombie Hero.\nLee Shin Woo wanted to assess his strength as objectively as possible, and around the time he mulled over it, Kratia, who had been looking straight at him, seemed to be deliberating something and then said this, as if it were nothing.\n\"Shin Woo, you should be able to reach level 7.\"\n\"Stop complimenting me. Stop. It’s frightening just thinking about it.\"\nNo matter how hard he struggled, would he be able to scratch Guillotine Steelworker? If he rode atop Jin’s back and charged at full speed with the Drake Horn Lance, he might be able to land a telling blow, but there’s no guarantee that Guillotine Steelworker would just sit there and take it; plus, it would be his turn to attack after.\n\"No, you can do it because you realized what’s important early on and kept refining yourself. I’ve never seen anyone who could harmonize their body and mana together so perfectly... Perhaps it might’ve been easier because your body’s only made of bones.\"\n\"You want to go?\"\n\"I’m just happy that there’s more for me to study since you leveled up.\"\nThere was absolutely no lies in what she said. She was genuinely happy that Lee Shin Woo had leveled up. It looked as though she just wanted to stay here and study his magic. Lee Shin Woo spoke carefully, stopping her.\n\"There’s something I need to do before that, so just stay put while looking at this.\"\n\"Hmm? Oh.\"\nLee Shin Woo had thrown her the Limited order Bone Core. Many of its function had been released and changed due to Lee Shin Woo, and there was a lock set up that allowed those he’d approved of to control the golems. Realizing this, Kratia’s eyes opened wide.\n\"...Are you a genius?\"\n\"You’ll probably get something out of studying that. Then, I’ll get going.\"\n\"Where are you going anyway?\"\nKratia wasn’t the only one curious; Jin also looked curious and asked. Lee Shin Woo briefly explained God’s garden to them. Kratia was disgusted, and Jin sported an odd expression.\n\"Don’t you want to meet her too?\"\n\"I do, and I don’t. ...It feels like I was too greedy, and nowadays it makes me think.\"\nThat’s right. That’s because he had familiarized himself with karma. As he adapted and developed in this world, he became acutely aware of how childish he had been. Lee Shin Woo could definitely agree with that sentiment.\nBut since he still wanted to give her an earful for not telling him about what was going to happen to him, he didn’t really reply.\n[Would you like to swap out 10 permits to God’s secret shop for 1 permit to God’s garden?]\nLee Shin Woo knew he had 11 permits right now. In other words, even if he didn’t acquire what he wanted from God’s garden, he could go to the secret shop later if he wanted.\nLee Shin Woo unhesitatingly nodded his head. Soon, a blinding light burst in the air, and a smallish light descended upon his head.\n[You have acquired a permit to God’s garden. Would you like to enter now? You may bring the contracted Jin Taylor with you.]\n\"Yeah.\"\nHe didn’t think the ’one plus one’ rule would be applied here as well. In any case, Lee Shin Woo thought it wouldn’t be bad to take him along, so he looked back at Jin; Jin seemingly understood what Lee Shin Woo was implying and nodded his head with a bitter expression. Kratia was examining the Limited Order Bone Core with great interest, and just lightly waved her hand at them.\n\"We’re entering together.\"\n[You have used a permit to God’s garden and are entering God’s garden.]\nLike when he entered God’s secret shop, the surrounding landscape softly melted away. Lee Shin Woo knew it was a senior level teleportation spell, a level he couldn’t yet reach. It was a spell that transported one’s consciousness into this space, which was neither the underground nor surface.\n\"Ugh...\"\nFirst, his surroundings turned to white. Next, flowers he didn’t even know the names of bloomed on the ground and emitted a refreshing scent. There was a gust of wind, as well as sunlight.\nA silver table formed and chairs rose up. Finally, a beauty with red hair appeared on the opposite side. She resembled Pleine, but she was also extremely different; before him was a woman who possessed countless appearances. The woman saw Lee Shin Woo and spoke leisurely, as if she had been waiting for him.\n\"Why don’t you sit down?\"\n\"...Alright.\"\nLee Shin Woo replied meekly and sat down in the chair. He had just noticed, but he had returned to his human form. He thought this might happen, as this was a mental world; whatever appearance he himself perceived would manifest in this world.\nHe was touched that he was in his original human form again, but he wasn’t too shaken. Since he was well aware that this appearance just existed in his consciousness. Therefore, he instead asked his first question.\n\"Where did Jin go?\"\n\"Did you really think I wouldn’t be able to talk to you both at the same time?\"\nHe thought that they would both meet God at the same time like when they went to the secret shop, but it seems like they each received a one-on-one talk. He was worried that Jin had already been caught up in God’s pace. However, it seemed as though God had seen right through him and laughed softly.\n\"I didn’t call you to punish you, so don’t worry. Your delicate and innocent partner should easily get a new blessing. You see, there’s a suitable skill that’ll strengthen him.\"\n\"...It sounds like that’s not the same for me.\"\n\"Exactly. You’re neither delicate nor innocent, are you?\" Googlᴇ search noⅴelfire.net\nGod tilted her head above the table, resting her chin in her hand; she was clearly looking straight at him. Her eyes looked truly amused.\n\"There’s nothing more I can do for you. I assure you, your talent in handling mana is greater than any hero before you. If I knew you had such talent, then I wouldn’t have gone through the trouble of turning you into a mere skeleton.\"\n\"...\"\nThe moment he heard that, it would be a lie to say he wasn’t pissed. Before she sent him to the Underground Empire, she was the one who had to ascertain his talent and take measures! However, it seems as though she’d noticed the dissatisfaction in his eyes and waved her hand.\n\"Even I don’t have a way to measure how talented someone is who hasn’t yet manifested mana. The only thing I could do was to listen to your wish and try to answer it as best I can.\"\n\"Well, it is true that my request was excessive. At the time, I was so scared of the Empire that I was just trying to figure out a way to stay safe no matter what. ...But you should’ve told me. You should’ve explained karma in more detail.\"\n\"I definitely said that you’d have to pay the price back then.\"\n\"...\"\nHearing that, Lee Shin Woo briefly gazed at God. Her attitude pissed him off, but he couldn’t shake off the thought that she had deliberately responded so absentmindedly to rile him up. It felt as though she tried pissing him off so that he wouldn’t think deeply about the subject.\nTherefore, he thought of something else. Perhaps it wasn’t just due to her ill nature that she turned him into a skeleton, but another, important reason... However, God stubbornly didn’t give him the chance to ask.\n\"Sorry to disappoint you, but we can’t talk for very long. There’s nothing I can do for you in terms of skills or karma, so I’ll give you an item in exchange. If you have any other questions, ask me next time.\"\n\"...Then I’ll ask a quick question. Is it fine to leave Ethan Cruz as is?\"\nLee Shin Woo had asked under the assumption that his senior hero, Ethan Cruz, was an s.o.b., causing God to momentarily pause; however, it wasn’t something that she could just easily pass over.\n\"It’s really hard for me to control those who I’ve bestowed my power to. I can’t take back what I’ve given, and I cannot personally exercise my power...\"\n\"That’s enough with the pretense. What do you really think?\"\n\"Honestly, I don’t really care what happens so long as the Empire is purified. Ethan Cruz is, at the very least, a truly devoted hero in that aspect.\"\nThat was bullshit; so much so that it was unbelievable that God had said it herself. God must’ve realized that what she was said was too harsh, as she quickly added.\n\"But don’t worry. He can’t do anything to you. Ah, your partner too.\"\n\"If there was one thing similar between us, it’s that our curse resistance is maxed out... It seems like that asshole’s authority is connected to the curse. Well, the Empire is filled to the brim with the curse, so if you want to get stronger, someone who can handle the curse would have an advantage. ...Wait a sec, did you plan for that from the start by giving us these authorities?\"\n\"I wonder. I just gave you what you wished for.\"\nGod played innocent until the very end, but one part of her face was stiff. Lee Shin Woo couldn’t help but acknowledge that he’d been robbed[1] by this short talk. God’s eyebrows quivered.\n\"...Did you gain a lot in the Empire?\"\n\"There was a lot I could recover from countless peoples’ memories. It’s all because of you.\"\n\"You desperately wished for immortality above all else, yet it seems like you’re actually ignoring that ability right now and are moving in an effort to get stronger; that’s quite funny.\"\n\"It’s because I possess immortality that I can move so proactively. ...So I don’t regret it. I’m satisfied with myself right now.\"\nThe moment he finished speaking, Lee Shin Woo was engulfed by blazing black flames. The flames that only burned what its owner wished for it to burn! His skin, hair, muscles, and flesh were all burned, and what remained was a level 5 Elemental Skeleton Joker.\nHe had completely discarded the part that was still attached to his human self, and he had fully accepted himself as is.\n\"...Ha.\"\nGod couldn’t believe what she was seeing and just laughed. And to God, Lee Shin Woo firmly said.\n\"Now I’ll tell you what I want.\"\n\"A level 6 item is enough, right?\"\n\"Please give me a quest.\"\n\"Hmm...?\"\nNeither a skill nor an item, but a quest? God tilted her head, wondering what he was plotting, and then she heard something unbelievable.\n\"I would like to give the heroes who have died and become undead peace. Please give me their location, as well as a quest to eliminate them.\"\n[1] T/N: Talking about how he didn’t get a lot of answers despite paying such a high price.",

    "content": "<Chapter 17. Disguise - 1>\n\"You’re back? It doesn’t look like you’ve changed much.\"\n\"What about you? Ah.\"\nKratia, who had been focusing on the core, greeted them and Lee Shin Woo just tilted his head. He soon realized that she was talking about Jin, not him. But it was strange that the man in question, Jin, wasn’t even here. Kratia spoke unimportantly.\n\"He just started running all of a sudden. He should be back soon.\"\n...Perhaps seeing his human appearance again within the mental world was traumatizing for him. Lee Shin Woo promised that he would treat Jin well when he came back, and opened his mouth for a second time.\n\"Do you know what ability Jin got?\"\n\"Magic armor.\"\n\"...Magic armor?\"\n\"Yeah. Jin got an ability that creates a magic barrier, right? That and Steel Body fused together to make the ability enclose his outer body in magic steel armor. God’s blessing was added as well, so I suppose we can trust in its effectiveness. Honestly, it was a skill that greatly supplemented his strength and health.\"\nHearing that, Lee Shin Woo marveled at the fact Jin asked God to fuse those two skills together. Since it was an ability created by God, its power was assured.\nMoreover, Jin had acquired a skill that supplemented both his strength and health, so it was easy to figure out what Jin needed to focus on in order to further develop in the future. Magic.\n’It’s a good skill for Jin, who had it rough due to his irregularly high agility. It seems God was fairly considerate.’\nIf she had been that considerate before, he wondered how good it might’ve been, but he had to be satisfied with the past. At that thought, Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly, and Kratia then inquired.\n\"But it looks like you haven’t changed at all.\"\n\"I really haven’t changed at all.\"\n\"Jin received such a huge present from her, yet... Ah, did your entire share go to Jin?\"\n\"You see, I got something else.\"\nLee Shin Woo replied, revealing that he had no intention of telling her, and Kratia looked at him coyly. However, Lee Shin Woo was immune to honey traps, so he just responded with a thin smile. She was only accompanying them temporarily to study Lee Shin Woo’s magic, so he had no intention of sharing everything with her.\n[Hero’s Will]\n[As a result of you reaching an agreement with God, you have opened up a new test. Though the graves of the heroes she sent to the Underground Empire before are mostly hidden, her blessing still remains. Please give them peace, inherit their strength and will, and purify the Empire. But be careful. Because these heroes, who have come back in undeath, still believe themselves to be heroes.]\n[Quest reward - Every hero you put to rest: 1 additional permit to God’s secret shop, and Invisible Heart reinforcement]\nNormally, when one takes down an undead hero, they receive the undead hero’s Perium, as well as a permit to God’s secret shop. He would get an additional permit for every kill as well, so if he resolved himself and farmed them, it wouldn’t be impossible to go to God’s garden again.\n’Moreover, there’s a reward I didn’t even ask for: Invisible Heart reinforcement.’\nSo long as it doesn’t increase the skill level under the pretense of ’reinforcing’ it, he could honestly say that he was excited about this clause. In any case, he now knew where all the undead heroes scattered around the Empire were, meaning that he had fulfilled his objective in meeting God.\n\"...I’m back.\"\n\"Welcome back... Ooh.\"\nLee Shin Woo was suddenly satisfied with his decision and nodded his head; then, Jin returned. Seeing the magic steel armor that completely covered him, Lee Shin Woo was in awe.\nThough it was called magic armor, that wouldn’t do it justice; it wasn’t simply armor. By wearing it, Jin’s body would be reinforced and the term ’Powered Suit’ was more appropriate to describe this authority. So this is what it meant by supplementing his strength and health! With this, even if he’s hit quite hard, he wouldn’t feel the impact!\n\"Is your mana ok?\"\n\"Just maintaining it doesn’t use any mana. It uses up mana whenever I’m hit, or I use a lot of force.\"\n\"I think you should focus on magic, rather than health and strength from now on.\"\n\"Yeah, probably should.\"\nDespite the fact that his ability had developed rapidly, Jin acted way too calmly. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo was about to carelessly ask if he was ok, but blocked his mouth with his hand. He had returned to being a human being for just an instant, and was now a Skeleton Horse again, so there was no way he was ok.\nHowever, was it because of their assimilation? Jin noticed the slight bit of hesitation and movement from Lee Shin Woo. As well as roughly figuring out what he was thinking.\n\"...I admire you, Shin Woo.\"\n\"Stop it.\"\nJin understood that Lee Shin Woo was trying to be considerate of him, and was suddenly surprised that Lee Shin Woo could just stand there so calmly, despite experiencing the same thing he did. It felt like his own seething emotions were beginning to abate.\n\"As I thought, it seems like joining up with you was a good idea.\"\n\"Man, stop it already.\"\nJin chuckled seeing Lee Shin Woo look so uncomfortable.\nKratia decided not to interfere with their conversation, and immersed herself in the study of the core. It was good that she did. The two skeleton heroes began to look past whatever pretense she put up.\n\"That woman. It doesn’t seem like she’s just ill natured.\" Googlᴇ search NoveIꜰire.net\nJin said. Lee Shin Woo also thought that way.\n\"You want to say that she made us into undead on purpose, right?\"\n\"Yeah, but I don’t know why she did it.\"\n\"I wonder. It may unexpectedly be something unimportant. She could’ve thought that she should send undead this time, since nothing was going right by sending humans.\"\nLee Shin Woo thought he’d seen God’s true intentions in her garden. She said that it didn’t matter what happened, so long as the Empire was purified, but... doesn’t that show just how desperate she is? Wouldn’t her true intention be that she wanted to purify the Empire, no matter the cost?\n\"Is that really the only reason...?\"\n\"Even if there were another reason, we can’t know now. So, we have to learn more about this world.\"\nArema Steelworker’s golems, General Seagald’s undead, the Emperor in the capital... as well as the Skeleton Commander’s last words, ’I wanted to leave the Empire’.\nHe was sure that the secret that surrounded the Underground Empire wasn’t simple. He needed to move more proactively, if for no other reason than to figure that secret out.\n\"Do you think our senior heroes will know anything about it?\"\n\"Maybe. I can’t really ask about it in the chatting channel.\"\nLee Shin Woo just shrugged his shoulders. Truthfully, he wasn’t much different from Kratia. He couldn’t easily trust someone before meeting them in person. Jin roughly thought the same as him, as he didn’t even use the chatting channel.\n\"Then what do we do now?\"\n\"Before that... Kratia?\"\n\"I want to keep looking at this a bit more.\"\nKratia’s cheeks were flushed because she was pissed that she hadn’t been able to understand the core in detail.\nThat would mean that she, who studied magic all her life, was lagging behind Lee Shin Woo, so she couldn’t help but be pissed! Of course, it was also due to the special circumstances he’d faced.\n\"It’s probably impossible for me to create a golem’s mana. But now that it’s come to this, I’m going to figure out a way to hack the generated mana no matter what.\"\n\"Remember to tell me how you did it, if you do find out.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nLee Shin Woo was only more talented than Kratia in changing mana and handling it, but he couldn’t even compare to her in terms of magical theory. He thought that perhaps it was actually a good idea to leave the core with her and stood up.\n\"Then we got to go to the sewers now. I’ll definitely eat Pudding[1] no matter what.\"\n\"I wish it were pudding that we could actually eat...\"\nThey had been talking about huge topics like God’s true objective and the Empire’s secret, yet they suddenly returned to reality and talked about the sewer dungeon, which was truly distressing. Regardless, Jin had to follow along, so he just sighed.\n\"You don’t need to go to the secret shop?\"\n\"There’s still a long time before I reach level 6, so I’ll wait a while.\"\nOf course, he had become level 5 in the time since he’d last gone to the secret shop, as well as accumulating more than 3,000,000 Perium from clearing out the golems as well as a city.\nHowever, he had to raise his stats by around 1,500 to reach the next level, so what would buying one or two bones do? He also only had one permit to God’s secret shop left from entering God’s garden, so he planned to gather more Perium until he at least acquired one more permit.\n\"Then that means we have to go into the sewers...\"\n\"I wonder if there’s a secret facility here as well. It’d be great if there were.\"\nBut unfortunately, they had no such luck; there was no secret facility there. Since Anti-Skull didn’t exist in every single city’s sewers. However, the sewers were overflowing with slimes that thrived from eating filth, and Lee Shin Woo didn’t just simply kill them.\n\"For dozens of years, slimes gradually and naturally fuse together and develop their abilities. However, the Great Slime from last time was afraid of my flames and started to eat any slimes that it came across.\"\n\"How can you be so sure?\"\nJin’s goblin fire was tinged with sympathy, as he saw the slimes run around hectically at the handful of flames placed atop their heads.\n\"How can you call yourself a human being?\"\n\"Can’t you see I’m a skeleton?\"\nPerhaps because this was a commercial city that various people frequented, the amount of wastewater in here was no joke; also, the quantity of discharged mana was equally large, so perhaps that was why it was a level 3 dungeon. The slimes that they encountered from the start of the dungeon were at least level 2.\nBut how could he progress by killing them? The only remaining answer was for them to fuse.\n\"Now you guys. Fuse together. I said fuse together.\"\n\"You...\"\nSoon, one of the slimes responded to Lee Shin Woo’s devilish whispers. Ultimately, it realized that if it didn’t want to be burnt, leaving behind only its core, it would have to eat its comrades!\nIts target struggled, but the slime was ultimately absorbed, and it seemed excited about its newfound size as it started to eat the others as well. In just a short while, it had gathered a considerable amount of mana, and managed to level up and become an elite at the same time!\n[Lv3 Great Slime]\n\"See? It worked. It’s really easy to make an elite monster.\"\n\"...\"\nJin looked terrified, and the Great Slime in the middle, who looked at them vacantly, finished eating all of the slimes and rushed further into the passage, as if it knew it was still no match for Lee Shin Woo.\nSince it was a level 3 dungeon, there should be some level 3 slimes in here. It should be able to transform into a King Slime after eating all of its competitors, no, perhaps even something greater than that! Lee Shin Woo didn’t hide his anticipation and followed behind it. Jin just prayed that he would be able to leave these dirty sewers soon.\n[Ggureureureureureuoooooooh!]\n\"Oooooooh!\"\nAfter that, it had finally finished eating all of the slimes in the dungeon and evolved into a level 5 Great King Slime. It wanted to get revenge on Lee Shin Woo, but unfortunately, it couldn’t move properly because it had gotten too big, so it was swept away by Lee Shin Woo’s flames and died after one grand explosion.\n[1] T/N: His ’affectionate’ term for slimes.",

Proficiency of Rule of Bone has increased by 2%.] Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on novel※fire.net\n\"So stingy. I went through all that trouble to make a level 5 elite monster, but I only get 4 stats in return... It’ll take several months to get to level 6 at this rate.\"\n\"Isn’t that still really quick?\"\nEven some of his seniors, who’d arrived in the Underground Empire long before him weren’t level 6 yet, so it was indeed quick. However, Lee Shin Woo, who had the disposition of a thief, thought he’d be able to continue developing at a rapid pace, so he couldn’t be happy about this.\n\"Most of my skills have gotten to the intermediate level, so I probably won’t be able to get much stat growth from leveling up my skills... The only things left remaining are achievements.\"\n\"Don’t tell me you’re going to go around looking for high leveled elite monsters. Just go step by step like you’ve been doing.\"\n\"Tch.\"\nHearing Jin’s astute observation, Lee Shin Woo clicked his (nonexistent) tongue, and examined the treasure chest. Unfortunately, there wasn’t anything noteworthy within.\n\"A Low-Rank Swordsmanship skill book? It seems like there really are people who don’t have this level of skill before they clear this dungeon. There’s a pair of useless level 2 Iron Boots... at least this is a little better.\"\nA level 3 Tempered Steel Shield. As soon as he held it, the material turned to bone, and was absorbed by him; it felt as though he had satisfied some sort of condition and at that moment, his skill leveled up.\n[The Bone Armory skill has become Lv3. Health and Magic have increased by 5. You can fuse the materials and special characteristics of the equipment you have absorbed with another piece of equipment and supplement it, but the level is still too low, so it’s only half-effective. Updating information regarding the equipment stored in Bone Armory.]\n\"Huh!?\"\nLee Shin Woo was flustered at the sudden series of events. In the blink of an eye, the shield, as well as armor and helmet he was wearing disappeared. Lee Shin Woo stood, flustered, and a message slowly appeared before him!\n[Bone Armory Lv3:\nLv4 Acid Bone Armor (Defense 250 - 410) - Acid Type Effectiveness +10%\nLv4 Acid Bone Leg (Defense 210 - 320) - Acid Type Effectiveness +10%\nLv4 Acid Bone Shield (Defense 350 - 400) - Acid Type Effectiveness +10%\nLv4 Acid Skull Helm (Defense 250 - 310) - Acid Type Effectiveness +10%\nLv4 Lightning Tooth (Attack Power 450 - 480) - Lightning Lv4, Effectiveness of Bursting Thunder +20%\nLv4 Melting Bone Double Axe (Attack Power 480 - 760) - Acid Lv3, Acid Type Effectiveness +20%\nLv5 Drake Horn Lance (Attack Power 1,000 - 1,200) - Effectiveness of charge-related skills +40%]\n\"How is this...\"\nOf course, he had a rough idea. He thought of each and every piece of equipment separately before, but now he could combine the characteristics and materials of absorbed equipment into another piece of equipment to create a sturdier and more powerful one!\nLee Shin Woo examined the updated description of the equipment stored within Bone Armory and he became even more sure of it. Through the Bone Armory skill, the Acid Skull Helm’s materials and characteristics were fused with the other defensive equipment and reinforced; because of that, the once level 3 armor all became level 4.\n\"They really were reinforced...\"\nLee Shin Woo summoned his upper and lower body armor, equipped them, and interjected. Not only had the armors inherited the Acid Skull Helm’s materials and characteristics in its entirety and gotten much tougher, but the magic within these armors covered in a slight green energy was definitely improving Lee Shin Woo’s acid element.\nIf he were to equip the Acid Bone Armor, Leg, and Helm, while wielding the Melting Bone Double Axe, the effectiveness of the acid element would increase by 50%! Though it was impossible right now since he could still only summon three pieces of equipment at a time!\n’In other words, I can create a full matching set of equipment with just one piece of the set now. As I thought, it was a good idea to get information on the undead heroes.’\nBut the limitations to the skill were quite clear for now. He couldn’t transfer the characteristics of the Lightning Tooth or the Drake Horn Lance to other pieces of equipment yet. It was without a doubt because these two pieces of equipment were at a higher level than the Bone Armory skill itself.\nHowever, the skill level will gradually go up, and if that happens, someday... Lee Shin Woo imagined himself wearing Drake Horn Armor and shuddered. He could also obtain an even more powerful piece of equipment and transfer those characteristics to another piece of a equipment!\n’I thought it might be possible someday, but... I should start gathering equipment that possess various special characteristics. Do they sell equipment in the secret shop too?’\nThe dungeon reward by itself was trifling, but he didn’t lose out, as it had caused his Bone Armory to level up.\nLee Shin Woo looked much more consolidated and stylish than before (in the process of being affected by the Acid Skull Helm, the upper and lower body armor both changed in appearance, similar to the Acid Skull Helm) and after equipping the armor, he returned to the purified city. Kratia was still struggling with the core.\n\"Is it going well?\"\n\"It’s going really well. I can do it if you give me one more day.\"\nKratia bluffed and Lee Shin Woo could tell. That competitive magician was going to figure out everything regarding the core no matter what. For the time being, he just needed to let her be.\n\"Then we’ll go and clear out the surrounding area, so you just keep studying the core. You guys, follow me.\"\n[It’s an honor.]\n[In the name of Steelworker!]\n\"Ah, perhaps...\"\nWhen they were about to leave, Kratia hastily grabbed him. Did she want to extend the duration of the contract? Lee Shin Woo tilted his head and turned around, and Kratia, while still holding onto the core, requested honestly, even whilst looking extremely embarrassed.\n\"If you find any... things like wild fruit in the dungeon, then...\"\n\"I got it. Since there’re no living organisms nearby that can eat fruit, anyway.\"\n\"Thanks.\"\nKratia said, and looked over at Jin. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo sighed again. Fortunately, Jin didn’t say anything.\n\"I’m just saying this because it seems like you’ve misunderstood me, but I’m not envious of that girl just because she’s alive. And I don’t hate her either.\"\nKratia saw them off, and the rest of them left the city; Lee Shin Woo found a trace of mana and Jin suddenly spoke while running slowly (since the golems were accompanying them). Lee Shin Woo just tilted his head.\n\"Then what is it?\"\n\"It makes me feel really narrow-minded admitting this, but... besides just being human, Kratia is...\"\n\"Kratia is...?\"\n\"...Nah, it’s nothing. Actually, I’d rather not say.\"\n\"You were the one who started, so how can you stop midway... Sorry, it wasn’t me. It’s my secretary’s fault.\"\nJin seemed to be quite concerned about it, so Lee Shin Woo decided to lighten the mood with a joke, but all he got in return was an intense shaking from Jin. Even though he suffered through Jin’s reprisal, he remembered when he was young and played with his friends and was very slightly pleased.\nFor a few days, Lee Shin Woo, Jin, and the three Iron Golems used the purified city as their base camp and swept away the undead in the vicinity.\nThey were able to clear a few patrolling battalions of undead that hadn’t fallen with their city, killed the undead roaming about, and cleared a few dungeons as well. It seemed as though most of the low level dungeons were ignored by their seniors, thus Lee Shin Woo and Jin were able to hog them to themselves. Along with that...\n[Level 4 dungeon - You have acquired a permit for the Kerr Century Winery. All stats within the dungeon increase by 30. The dungeon information is added to your minimap. All of your actions are buffed within the dungeon.]\n[The Intermediate Mana Bone skill has become Lv2. Magic has increased by 10. You can now maintain your magic for a longer period of time.]\nFive days after their clean up of the city’s vicinity had begun, Lee Shin Woo struck gold, finding a dungeon that was completely hidden.\n\"How the hell did you find this dungeon!?\"\n\"With my senses.\"\nLee Shin Woo used Mana Bone as the foundation for his mana detecting ability, and in the process of creating a golem’s mana, he realized the elemental categories; that was the start of his explosive growth, and now he was able to find all of the hidden dungeons with just one look of the area.\nThe other day, Prince Altania had boasted how good he was at finding dungeons in the chatting channel, and sure enough, now that he had a knack for mana, it had become much easier to find dungeons. Probably much more proficiently than the Prince at that.\n\"It should be fine since it’s just a level 4 dungeon, but I suppose we should tread with caution.\"\n[We will protect you.]\n[We will take point.]\nThe golems, which were strengthened from having their limiters removed, gladly took point. Truthfully, whenever he gave them an order, they would respond way too passionately. Lee Shin Woo cursed at the Steelworkers for having bad taste and followed behind the golems.\n\"Huh...?\"\n\"Something smells sweet.\"\nOnly after he entered did he ruminate over the dungeon’s name, Kerr Century Winery. That’s right. A winery. It was a place where they made fermented foods like alcohol or vinegar. And between those two, this smell was distinctly...\n\"Wine?\"\n\"Did you like wine before?\"\n\"I told you, I was a sprinter. I didn’t drink, and I didn’t smoke. But that doesn’t mean I’m totally clueless of wine.\"\nThe two were completely calm. Even if the most expensive and delicious wine popped in front of them, what could they do? It’s not like they could drink it. Jin was already really depressed, but now he was even gloomier than before; Jin spoke less, and Lee Shin Woo patted his head as they continued onwards. Soon, one of the golems reported.\n[There are no monsters. I believe the dungeon was sealed in order to protect goods.]\n\"Yeah, I agree.\"\nWhen they progressed a bit further, they found the cause of that sweet smell: the ripening room. The sight of countless lines of wine barrels was nothing else but magnificent. But there were two things that concerned him.\n\"It’s become vinegar or has evaporated. One of the two...\"\n\"Definitely not based on the smell.\"\nLee Shin Woo came close to one of the wine barrels and examined it. The material was clearly different from the oak from Earth. It was probably a type of wood that only existed in this world.\nThe barrel possessed a mark that came about due to being singed with flame, and it was clearly in the shape of a letter; it was likely a magic letter that allowed the application of magic on all of the barrels.\n\"It truly is a fantasy world. They use magic to ripen wine as well, huh?\"\n\"C-Check it. Hurry.\"\nJin had totally forgotten that he couldn’t even drink the wine and was extremely excited. Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and calmly placed his hand atop the wooden barrel. Whenever he wanted to, he could instinctually use his mana and examine something; he felt like it was natural now. It was all because of his singular focus on the golems, as well as Kratia, who taught him a systematic approach.\nTo be honest, it wasn’t very difficult to ascertain the contents of the barrel compared to the Limited Order Bone Core, and was soon met with an organized message in front of him.\n[Kerr Century Dellocus 395]\n[The year prior to the Empire’s fall, mother earth seemed almost aware of the Empire’s fall, and shined brilliantly with the last of its life. The grapes harvested at that time held the highest value ever, and the businessmen of Kerr Century Winery did their best to prepare and create wine.]\n[The alcohol contained in this barrel was kept in tip-top shape and slowly ripened. However, there wasn’t anyone left to drink it by the time it was finished ripening.]\n[The wine is at its highest value and will never decrease in value under any circumstances. There are 52 liters of Kerr Century Dellocus 395 within this wine barrel.]\n[This wine was created prior to the fall and was stored properly; the karma of this wine is not light under any circumstances.]\n\"Mm...\"\nNormally, the wine within would be full, but as a result of evaporating for dozens of years, there were only 52 liters left. It was kept in tip-top condition through the ripening room and the magic on the barrels and had continued to ripen, so he could tell just how good the wine was without even drinking it.\n\"There should be a total of about 3,000 liters in here.\"\n\"Should we just spill it all at once and take a shower in it?\"\n\"That’s not such a bad idea, but...\"\nLee Shin Woo looked at the last line added to the explanation and thought deeply. Then spoke after making up his mind.\n\"Couldn’t we sell this at the secret shop?\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 17. Disguise - 3>\nIf he had just one more permit to God’s secret shop, he would’ve used it without any hesitation.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo only had one permit right now, and he didn’t know how much he could sell this wine for, so he couldn’t take the risk so easily. Lee Shin Woo clicked his tongue and muttered.\n\"Senior Seira is a prophet. A prophet.\"\n\"You seem to be getting along with our seniors.\"\n\"If you’re jealous, then why don’t you enter the channel too?\"\n\"D-Don’t want to.\"\nWhenever he told Jin, who was jealous of his relationship with other people, to do something about it and go into the chatting channel, he would always say that he didn’t want to; Lee Shin Woo just laughed.\nHe could roughly understand how he felt. Normally, the less self-confidence one has, the more passive they become in terms of maintaining relationships with other people. Needless to say, since Jin was a Skeleton Horse, it was obvious how low his self-esteem was.\n\"For starters, let’s pack all of the wine into our inventories. Since we don’t need to pack food in our inventories.\"\n\"It might’ve been a waste of space if we hadn’t leveled up to 5.\"\nAs the two rose to level 5, their inventories suddenly doubled in size. They, who didn’t really have any necessities in their inventories, possessed inventories that were uselessly large; they managed to fill at least half of their inventories with the wine barrels in the ripening room.\n\"This one’s 25 liters, and this one’s 47 liters... It wasn’t a problem with the ripening magic, but there was a difference in the fermented wine’s condition at the beginning of the ripening process. Because of that, they all taste different, despite being produced in the same year and being the same age. This might be some sort of craftsmanship as well.\"\n\"So how many liters in total?\"\n\"1,965 liters.\"\n\"Wow.\"\nThough they weren’t bottled, it was a truly large amount of wine. If his seniors saw this, they would’ve fainted. Since they would cheer whenever they found a single wine bottle intact in a dungeon or a city.\nThis was all due to Lee Shin Woo, who miraculously found this dungeon, and him nonchalantly releasing the seal, which was a highest rank lock that could only be released by those of the Kerr Century Winery. Of course, Lee Shin Woo trusted that this was something that all of his seniors could do as well.\n[Steelworker, we’ve found other areas as well.]\n\"Oh? Wow...\"\nHe had expected them to be here somewhere, and one of the Iron Golems scattered around, looking out for any potential danger, had found a location that stored bottled wine.\nThough they weren’t stored as perfectly as in the ripening room and there were several that couldn’t be used, Lee Shin Woo and Jin marveled at the fact that they could recover 30 bottles of luxurious wine. He’d only suffered ever since being dropped into the Empire, yet only now did he feel like he was actually performing the task of a hero. Isn’t it a hero’s duty to clear out an empty home?\n\"I wonder if there’s more stuff here.\"\n\"Probably not. We checked all the facilities outside of the winery.\"\n\"Yeah, you’re right. We checked all the fermentation facilities. But...\"\nThe businessmen had set such tight security on the entrance, so how would the grapes have gotten in? Lee Shin Woo briefly thought about it, and his goblin fire swayed unconfidently.\n\"The inventory?\"\n\"The inventory isn’t part of this world; it only belongs to the heroes.\"\n\"Did they use assassins?\"\n\"The businessmen raised assassins to protect the wine?\"\n\"...Then a secret passageway?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nIt was highly likely that they brought the grapes in through a secret passageway, as the security at the entrance was so tight. And hypothetically speaking, if the secret passageway was a direct link to the orchard...\n\"The orchard might be a dungeon too. Though it shouldn’t be as impenetrable as this place.\"\n\"...How do you even grow grapes underground?\"\n\"This entire empire is underground. Why couldn’t they if they had the skills?\"\n\"Ah, that’s right.\"\nLee Shin Woo led Jin and the golems, searched the winery, and ultimately succeeded. He released a few more hidden locks and examined the clearing’s wall; he broke through the wall, and though it wasn’t the size of golem’s railway, it was a quite bright and clean underground railway.\n\"It really did exist!?\" Thıs text ıs hosted at novᴇlfire.net\n\"Definitely.\"\nThough there was only a single wall dividing the underground passage and the winery, the air was quite different. There were several layers of magic applied to the winery to act as a smokescreen so that it couldn’t be found, but the railroad, which was outside of the spells’ range, wasn’t largely protected.\n\"What do we do if there are monsters or people aiming for the wine?\"\n\"Take a look around.\"\n\"Alright... Huh?\"\nJin looked back and was shocked. The winery they had just left had disappeared, and the railway just kept going on and on. Jin trembled and Lee Shin Woo explained firmly.\n\"This railroad probably goes through other facilities. They went so far as to make a smokescreen, so normally, you wouldn’t be able to tell it was a winery. Rather than impenetrable security, they chose to just to hide it naturally.\"\n\"You saw through that? What the hell were you before all this?\"\n\"Just a normal salaryman. Let’s go. You guys, get smaller and follow behind me quickly.\"\n[I understand.]\n[Reducing body size.]\nLee Shin Woo ordered, and the golems compressed their bodies. Though they were a lot smaller than when they had first entered the dungeons, but now they were shorter than two meters tall: a small-size mode!\nThrough this special mode, which sacrificed their bulk and weight to reduce the size of their tough bodies, their destructive power that came from their weight would be reduced, but their speed would overwhelmingly increase, and was better when they needed to move quickly, like right now.\nOf course, this wasn’t originally a command from the Limited Order Bone Core, but Lee Shin Woo possessed a senior administrative authority and was able to unlock the command.\n\"There are a lot of forked roads.\"\n\"This way.\"\nThey went as far as to so seamlessly hide the location of the winery, so it wasn’t surprising that there was an absurd amount of forked roads; however, whenever they came across one of them, Lee Shin Woo would boldly choose a path. Jin couldn’t help but be curious as he followed behind him.\n\"How are you making a decision so quickly?\"\n\"There are periodically some traces of where humans and vehicles went. Actually, to be exact, there are traces of mana being used to erase those tracks.\"\n\"...\"\nThe traces were erased by magic to conceal the tracks, but what did it even mean to grasp the traces of that very mana being used to erase those tracks? It felt as though the businessmen several dozens of years ago were playing in the palm of his hand.\n’Compared to finding the traces of Anti-Skull, this is nothing.’\nTen minutes of running and following Lee Shin Woo’s perfect navigation through the railroad, Lee Shin Woo suddenly stretched his palm towards the sky.\nThe Lighting Tooth appeared, spun round and round, and shot forward. The Lightning Tooth flew through the darkness and for a few seconds remained silent; then, for a moment, sparks scattered through the air.\n[Gguahk!]\n[You have hunted a Lv3 Root Eater.]\nFar-sight was affected by agility, so Jin could see it this time too. There was a large and hideous insect stuck to the ceiling, several kilometers in front of them; the insect emitted an unpleasant sound and approached them, but the Lightning Tooth cut through it and it fell to the ground.\nHowever, that was only the beginning. After it cleaved through the monster, it easily turned directions, and whilst maintaining its full power, found a new target and rushed towards it. The insects that came crawling towards them fell one by one; he began to hunt them resolutely.\n[Kihik!]\n[Shaah!]\nAs the group dashed towards him, they emitted a sound; aside from that, the underground passage had been completely quiet before, without even the sound of a rock rolling on the floor. However, the underground passage was soon filled with screams. Lee Shin Woo remained focused on the battlefront, and Jin wondered whether he should start running or not, and eventually half-heartedly ran. At that moment...\n\"Jin, stop!\"\n\"Ok!\"\nLee Shin Woo ordered, and at that very moment, the final forked road appeared. It divided into three paths and while nothing came out of his objective, the middle path, monsters poured out of the left and right paths as if they were waiting for him.\nHe felt repulsed from the sight of these insects, which he’d never seen on Earth and were bigger than humans. They were all level 3 or 4. He also saw some elites.\n[Kiheeeeeehk!]\n[Kik, Kihiiik!]\nHe’d never absorbed their bones before, so he wasn’t sure, but it seems like they were uneasy. They weren’t even humans they could eat, but bones, so they must’ve been uneasy that nothing good came.\nThe moment when those picky eaters gathered in the middle passageway, he burrowed the Lightning Tooth in the middle of their group. It pierced through a few gigantic insects and burrowed deep into the ground; intense sparks were discharged from it, paralyzing all of the bugs in the area.\n’Lightning and acid; they both have their advantages.’\nLee Shin Woo thought and willed the Lightning Tooth; at that moment, without giving the bugs a chance to recover and move... the Lightning Tooth exploded fiercely!\n[Critical Hit!]\n[The Rule of Bone skill has become Lv5. All stats have increased by 3.]\nThe lightning cloud engulfed the passage. Various parts of the passageway collapsed and emitted an awful sound; fortunately, the ceiling didn’t collapse. Since so many bugs screamed at once, it sounded like dozens of blackboards being scratched at once.\n\"Charge! Just keep the right side open!\"\n[Following your command!]\n[Assault mode!]\nLee Shin Woo commanded the golems to charge, summoned the Drake Horn Lance, and gripped it. He targeted the insects that were still intact and running out of the explosion, and charged with a force that would rip them to shreds!\n\"What about your mana!?\"\n\"I’m fine!\"\nThe weighty, cone-shaped lance discharged dark blue sparks. The entire weapon was clad in a fierce lightning. He couldn’t do anything about the weapon’s element, but Lee Shin Woo was already able to comfortably wield the lightning element, so doing this much was extremely easy for him!\nThe weapon tinged with lightning established an even greater harmony with Bursting Thunder, and was naturally able to release more destructive power. This was what it meant to wield the power of an element with one’s own effort.\n[Preparing for collision. Switching to thorn gloves.]\n[Destroying all enemies...]\n[In front!]\nAround the time Lee Shin Woo had finished his preparations to attack, the three golems simultaneously dashed into the front. Regardless of what lay before them, they pushed through it and lived up to their name; as level 5 golems which were more powerful and tougher than other level 5s none of the bugs could pierce through them.\n[Kihiiiiiik!]\n[Shaaahhk!]\nThe insects, which were running around flusteredly due to the explosion, weren’t able to avoid the golems properly.\nBecause of that, the bugs escaped to the right corner, the only location which the golems couldn’t cover. But naturally, Lee Shin Woo rushed over there. He used the Iron Golems, which were akin to an impregnable fortress, in order to lead the bugs into one place.\n[Kushaaaaaaaaaahk!]\n[Ggureureu, Ggureureureu!]\n\"Heuuuup!\"\nCompared to when he had pierced through an Iron Golem in a single blow, this group of bugs was nothing. Lee Shin Woo grabbed the Drake Horn Lance, which was roughly discharging electricity, with both hands and thrust forward, speeding forward with Jin. It was lightning that ran atop the earth: Ground Lightning!\n[Critical Hit!]\nThe primarily discharged sparks made it so that the bugs couldn’t move very well, and the following lance thrust brutally tore through their bodies. The blue sparks that came from the cone-shaped lance’s cutting edge made them look like a falling star!\nThen, they followed behind the golems and pushed through the passageway. The passageway was filled with the sound of screams, sparks, and reeked of a nutty smell. He’d never been so relieved that he could stomach this. [1]\n[We have destroyed all of the enemies in the area.]\n[Releasing thorn gloves.]\nThe golems said mechanically, and right after they stopped, Lee Shin Woo and Jin stopped as well. He thought there might be more, so he turned around, but all he saw were the bugs’ corpses.\n\"Why did you throw your weapon at the beginning if you were just going to go through them?\"\n\"I wanted to provoke all the guys on the ceiling. There’s no reason to do the same thing twice, right?\"\nBut after saying that, Lee Shin Woo clicked his tongue.\n\"I guess we do have to do the same thing twice. Golems, collect all of the bones and Perium.\"\n[I understand.]\n[Following command.]\n\"You...\"\nSeeing Lee Shin Woo treat the golems like slaves, Jin’s goblin fire narrowed. However, Lee Shin Woo actually muttered something even more brazen.\n\"Should I bring along a few golems, even though they’re a bit slow...?\"\nThere were insects hidden within the remaining passageway as well, but Lee Shin Woo and the golems thoroughly trampled them. Even if pest exterminators went at it, Lee Shin Woo was sure that they wouldn’t do a more perfect job than them, and Lee Shin Woo ultimately ended up arriving at his destination.\nIt was a vineyard.\n[1] E/N: Even though he doesn’t have a stomach.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 17 part4",
    "content": "<Chapter 17. Disguise - 4 [End of Volume 3]>\nFrom the start, he hadn’t expected the vineyard to be intact. Regardless of how prosperous the Underground Empire had been, living vegetation couldn’t be expected to last when neglected for so many years. It was different from ripening and storing alcohol.\n\"There’s no way the vineyard could’ve been maintained. There was a time I thought so as well...\"\n\"It’s still growing though, isn’t it...?\"\nThat’s right. The field, so vast that it felt unmeasurable, was filled with grapevines that emitted a fresh vigor, and large grapes hung upon each vine. Lee Shin Woo, who didn’t know much about the development of plant life, just knew that this wasn’t normal.\n\"Shin Woo, look. The field’s goes on and on, yet there isn’t a single dead vine.\"\n\"Does this mean the Underground Empire possesses the greatest magic on the planet? ...Huh?\"\nBut while marveling at the vineyard, Lee Shin Woo discovered an unusual trace. Contrary to the vineyard, there was no sign of magic involved, but there were traces of the ground being unearthed just a short while ago.\nThat wasn’t all. There were traces of the nearby grapevines’ unnecessary branches being cut off, as well as signs that grapes were harvested from the other grapevines.\n\"...\"\n\"Shin Woo?\"\n\"It couldn’t be an undead.\"\nOf course, that didn’t mean an undead couldn’t come into a dungeon. Since there was an instance of him killing a hero that had turned undead and gone into the dungeon.\nBut if that’s the case, there should be traces of the death energy that they emitted, but he didn’t see it at all. That meant there was only one possible answer: there was a living being managing this field.\n’Yeah, now that I think about it, there was a bulkhead protecting this field from the undead insects.’\nEven though the insects had become undead, they had a tendency to instinctively seek out fruit and move according to that instinct. They were only gathered in the underground passage, and the fact that they couldn’t enter the orchard meant that someone was protecting the vineyard.\n\"Golems, stealth mode.\"\n[Concealing magic and standing by below ground level.]\nLee Shin Woo said one line, and the three golems instantaneously burrowed into the ground and crawled in. In the blink of an eye, the golems concealed themselves; seeing that, Jin just blinked his eyes and Lee Shin Woo called for him.\n\"Jin.\"\n\"Why are you calling me so seriously again?\"\n\"You can cover yourself up with that magic armor, right?\"\n\"Magic armor... Ah, Steel Heart? Yeah, probably.\"\n\"Then use it right now. Use it so that you don’t look like an undead.\"\n\"Why do you want me to... never mind, I got it.\"\nJin knew that there was no way Lee Shin Woo’s intuition was wrong, and wordlessly covered his body with steel, making it so that no one would be able to tell he was a skeleton from the outside. Confirming that, Lee Shin Woo activated the Joker’s innate skill, Disguise.\n[Using the Disguise skill, you are disguised as someone you are completely familiar with.]\nHe had originally planned to primarily train this skill after parting ways with Kratia, but now that it’s come to this, there was no helping it.\nImmediately after acquiring the Disguise skill, he had thought about this. He’d already dispelled the misunderstanding between him, Kratia, and Ye Jin Jin and become friendly with them, but it wouldn’t be this easy from now on, so he decided to act like he was human through the Disguise skill.\n\"H-How did you...!?\"\n\"It only changes my exterior appearance. Calm down.\"\nJin looked at him in shock, but Lee Shin Woo just calmly replied and examined his body. His arm, which had been composed of black bones, was covered in skin.\nThat’s right. He was currently disguised as a human being. It was his first time using the skill, so even he himself was a bit surprised. It was truly a perfect disguise from the outside.\n\"Hey, how are you so calm right now...\"\n\"Here.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Shin Woo placed his human-looking hand atop Jin’s head, who was agitated and about to scream. At that moment, Jin really calmed down. Though it had the exact same feel of a human hand... it was extremely cold.\n\"Are you the exact same on the inside...?\"\n\"Yeah. Of course, if I were to use fire, I could mimic human temperature, but in the end, it’s still a disguise.\"\n\"I see...\"\nLee Shin Woo replied bitterly, and Jin replied in an almost dreary voice and drooped. Lee Shin Woo could understand him. Since Jin saw a chance of turning back into a human from his undead state in Lee Shin Woo’s Disguise skill.\nAs he thought, he should’ve told Jin about the skill before using it; Lee Shin Woo slightly regretted it.\n’Especially because the skill is so imperfect right now. I’d originally wanted to disguise myself as an extremely ordinary human being...’\nOriginally, the Disguise skill possessed some really troublesome conditions. Since he could only mimic the appearance of someone who he was completely familiar with and remembered.\nRight now, he could only disguise himself as a few types of skeletons, a golem, and his own appearance when he was alive on Earth; amongst them, the only one that looked like a hero was his human appearance.\n\"But when you were still on Earth, was your face... Shin Woo, they’re coming.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nLee Shin Woo never knew when the person managing this field would arrive, so he had disguised himself beforehand just in case. However, Jin, whose five senses and agility had grown, confirmed that there was a living being coming. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo stopped thinking about anything else and started to act as if he were just a normal human hero.\n\"...You there, stay where you are.\"\nAround the time he heard Jin and braced himself, he heard a voice carried by the wind from afar. Lee Shin Woo realized that this was a high level wind technique. They would actually be far away, but the technique allowed them to speak as if they were close by.\n’Calm down. They haven’t figured out who we are yet.’\n’I’m glad we’re not too late... Sorry, but you have to start acting like a horse from now on.’\nLee Shin Woo used his Assimilation skill to inaudibly converse with Jin, and told him to calm down physically and mentally; then, the voice continued speaking. It was a refreshing and clean girl’s voice.\n\"Who are you? ...Mm, are you human? A hero?\"\n\"It’s nice to meet you, Senior. My name is Lee Shin Woo.\"\n\"Ah, Lee Shin Woo!\"\nAs soon as Lee Shin Woo disclosed his name, the woman’s voice became noticeably relieved. Lee Shin Woo suddenly realized that it was a voice he’d often heard in the chatting channel, Erian Ruparte’s voice. He thought someone other than a hero was managing the field, but this made things easy.\nThat was one less unnecessary variable. It was a relief that he was able to learn and use his Disguise skill before it was too late. He’d like to avoid saying ’Stop, friendly fire!’ like he had against Kratia from now on.\n\"It’s nice to meet you, Senior... Ruparte?\"\nIn many ways, Lee Shin Woo felt relaxed, and turned around to greet her as calmly as possible. At least, he wanted to, but... when he saw her, he ended up stuttering.\n\"You’re as handsome as Jin Jin said! ...Ah, is it your first time seeing an elf?\"\n\"Uh, yes. There weren’t any elves in my world...\"\nLee Shin Woo replied powerlessly and she lowered her bow that had been aimed at him, smiling sweetly. She was garbed in simple colored clothing, but that simplicity seemed to accentuate her beauty.\nShe was dozens of kilometers away from them, but Lee Shin Woo could see her with just one glance; seeing her longish rising ears, Lee Shin Woo couldn’t hide his astonishment. She was really an elf that he’d only seen in comics before!\n\"I’ll go to you.\"\n\"...I understand.\"\nThough Lee Shin Woo looked like a human, he felt fundamentally different; from the start, she felt like a heavenly beauty that couldn’t be reached by a human.\nIf Lee Shin Woo were a normal man, he would’ve been surprised by her beauty and either faint or go crazy over her. However, his heart was calm like a beach without even a single gust of wind. On the contrary, Jin was surprised.\n’She’s really pretty...’\n’Jin, you really are a man... Hey, wait. I didn’t make fun of you this time. Hey!’\nJin shook his back up and down for no reason, and Lee Shin Woo protested Jin’s bullying. Erian Ruparte suddenly leapt towards them here and there, and approached them. He perceived elves as being extremely nimble, but it seemed like that was actually true.\nConsidering her short-term speed, it seemed as though she could even compete with Jin. It seemed like her staying power wasn’t bad either, as she quickly arrived in front of them.\n\"Hueut. You’ve come so far Mr. Lee Shin Woo, so you must come from a world that’s developed magic, but it must be quite a peculiar world to not have elves in it. It’s nice to meet you. My name is Erian Ruparte.\"\n\"As I’ve said, my name is Lee Shin Woo. This guy’s a horse I was lucky enough to get here.\"\n\"He...hehe.\"\nJin was trying his best! Fortunately, Erian Ruparte didn’t notice that Jin was strange.\n\"It’s a miracle that you found a living horse in a dungeon, but you also trained it? Aha, you must’ve been a knight, Lee Shin Woo! Right?\" Newest update provıded by novelꜰire.net\n\"It’s quite embarrassing, but yes, in my original world I was a knight.\"\nLee Shin Woo naturally lied and started to wonder whether he needed to learn more about how to act like a knight. No, that wasn’t important right now.\n\"As I thought, you were managing this field, Senior?\"\n\"Of course. It’d be difficult to create a field so teeming with life, but not for an elf.\"\nA peculiar facet of elves was that they were extremely prideful; Lee Shin Woo decided to keep this in mind. Erian Ruparte spoke with a friendly smile to the nodding Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Take as much as you want. I’m planning on leaving this area soon.\"\n\"Ah... Thank you.\"\n\"I knew you were in a danger level 2 zone, but I didn’t think we’d meet like this. Jin Jin is always talking about you, so it feels like I already know you. Lee Shin Woo, I had a lot I wanted to tell you if we met.\"\n\"Of course. ...I’d like to hear what Ye Jin Jin said about me as well, Senior.\"\n\"You can call me Erian.\"\nLee Shin Woo harvested the grapes with Erian’s help, and they started to speak about various matters. She planned to leave here and join up with Lloyd H.K., and Lee Shin Woo told her about how he got here (it was obviously a lie), and about other corresponding matters.\nLee Shin Woo subtracted roughly 80% of his achievements until now and relayed the remaining 20% to her, but even that 20% put Erian in a state of unceasing admiration. Just by telling her about how he defeated a few elites a higher level than him caused her eyes to shine.\n\"What amazing courage! I already heard about it from Jin Jin, but I didn’t think you’d be that good! Aren’t you afraid of death!?\"\n\"I wonder. That fear makes me want to challenge myself even more. If I’m not a bit courageous now, I feel like I’ll face off against an unstoppable foe later on...\"\n\"...Splendid. I’ll remember that.\"\nFrom the very beginning, Erian’s perception of Lee Shin Woo was pretty much the highest it could be. He could understand why, but whenever he said something, her response would contain ’Jin Jin’ in it.\n\"Have you contacted Jin Jin?\"\n\"Jin Jin would be happy if she knew that.\"\n\"Jin Jin is always...\"\nBefore long, Lee Shin Woo realized that Erian had completely mistaken his relationship with Ye Jin Jin. And that misunderstanding was probably for good reason. After all, there’s no smoke without a fire.\nHe clutched his aching head and replied as calmly as possible.\n\"I did private chat with her before, but...\"\n\"I see. Thank you very much. She’s kind, but the one who caused that once weak girl to diligently work hard is you, Lee Shin Woo.\"\n\"Ha, haha...\"\nLee Shin Woo’s inventory was soon completely full, and he then acted as though he was putting the rest of them into his own inventory while he was actually putting them in Jin’s inventory. It was possible because he was using his Assimilation skill to its maximum potential!\nHe couldn’t reveal that he was a skeleton and he was packing them because he had no other choice, but it did feel truly pointless. Kratia was the only one doing something important.\n\"Hoo. It felt regrettable just leaving this field, but it’s a relief that you’re here.\"\n\"Thank you again.\"\n\"I’m the one who should be thanking you. Since I grew the fruit to be eaten.\"\nAround the time the vineyard was completely cleared out, Lee Shin Woo figured out that while Erian was aware of the vineyard, she was completely unaware of the winery. As expected, she only took the route to the vineyard.\nFurthermore, he figured out that Erian seemed to like Lloyd, but hated the Prince. However, that wasn’t really important information.\n\"To be honest, the moment I saw you, I wanted to entrust this orchard to you, but...\"\n\"Ah, Senior. That’s...\"\nThat would be a pain in the ass. Kratia might want it, but Lee Shin Woo didn’t need grapes! However, when Lee Shin Woo thought about how to refuse, Erian said something that caused him to prick his (nonexistent) ears.\n\"However, that’s impossible. Honestly, I wanted to tell you this from the very beginning... a large force of undead is coming this way. We have to leave this area before we encounter them.\"",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 18 part1",
    "content": "<Chapter 18. Corps Destroyer - 1>\nThe large force of undead probably consisted of wandering skeletons from outside the commercial city. Lee Shin Woo acted calm, and spoke whilst nodding his head.\n\"Is the reason that you’re leaving now because...?\"\n\"To be honest, even after becoming level 6, I couldn’t completely give up on this field. However, once I learned of the impending undead force, I completely gave up on it. I asked Lloyd for his opinion, but he thought that this force may be troops under the 12 generals’ command. You see, a force that large and disciplined is not that common.\"\nNot only is a corps under the 12 generals’ command dangerous, but there’s also the possibility that they could get involved with the 12 generals themselves if something went wrong. Therefore, it would be a good idea to avoid them for now... When Lee Shin Woo heard her say all that, he honestly couldn’t believe it.\n’They’re pretty much giving us an opportunity to find out more about the 12 generals, but you’re just going to throw that all away?’\nIf he fought against the corps under the 12 generals’ command, he’d not only gain a ton of information, but he might cause some sort of change amongst the 12 generals by facing off against their force, which would be a huge advantage in and of itself!\nThere was nothing he could do if there were other heroes nearby, but he could at least consult the chatting channel once beforehand. Lee Shin Woo thought about mentioning it, but ultimately didn’t express his doubts aloud. Erian’s vibe wouldn’t permit it.\n\"Fortunately, we still have some time before they arrive. I’m not bragging, but we elves have sharp eyes, so I could tell early on that they were on the move. Since it’s a huge corps, they should take at least four days before they pass by here.\"\n\"What direction are they coming from?\"\n\"So... Ah, share your minimap with me. They should be around here.\"\nLee Shin Woo just laughed when he saw the coordinates she’d marked on his minimap.\nIt did feel like this was what was happening, but... those coordinates were extremely close to the commercial city, Kehebe, that he had left from.\n\"I see. We should leave before we encounter them.\"\n\"Ah, that’s a relief. I was concerned that you might say you’d fight them...\"\n\"I’m well aware of my limitations. I know the difference between courage and foolhardiness.\"\n\"Hoo... I’m glad. It seems like I’ll be seeing you for a very long time.\"\nDespite sounding somewhat pissed, Lee Shin Woo nevertheless replied as though he’d made up his mind. Hearing that, Erian was genuinely relieved and smiled simply. She also proposed a place worth going to.\n\"There’s a highlands in the west that’s filled with level 4 Bronze Golems. To be honest, I wanted to hunt them, but they aren’t a good match for me... Moreover, I want to join up with Lloyd as fast as possible, so I’ll give up the spot to my junior. You’re probably already well aware of this, but one golem is connected to all the others in the group, so lure them well and destroy them.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nThis was likely extremely generous for a hero who wandered around looking for strong foes.\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo knew more about these highlands than anyone, but he just acted like he was thankful for now. Erian nodded her head in satisfaction and extended her hand to him.\n\"I pray that we meet again someday. It’d be nice if Jin Jin was with us then.\"\n\"Yes, I hope we all stay safe until that day comes.\"\nLee Shin Woo unhesitatingly stretched his hand forward and shook her hand. Read complete versıon only at novel⟡fire.net\nErian felt the warmth of a human from his hand, as well as the sense of comfort and peace she would feel whenever she came across another hero. She smiled once again in relief feeling that she wasn’t the only one clinging on to life and struggling in this world filled with death.\nSeeing that, Lee Shin Woo responded with his own smile, confirming that he had indeed fooled her, and the two parted ways amicably.\n\"Lee Shin Woo, what are you going to do now? Do you think that girl’s already left?\"\nErian lead them outside and parted ways. Lee Shin Woo and Jin ran towards the west highlands, and when they were sure that they were outside the range of Erian’s hearing, Jin spoke. Naturally, he was talking about both her and Kratia.\n\"I feel like Kratia will just butt heads with anyone who comes her way.\"\n\"Yeah, it’s a relief since it would’ve been difficult to hunt with just the two of us.\"\nJin spoke nonchalantly and Lee Shin Woo chuckled. From the very beginning, he never intended on simply running away like Erian had suggested. Jin was already well aware that there was no way Lee Shin Woo would back off without even knowing their enemies’ number and levels.\n\"Then don’t we need to hurry back to the city? That girl wouldn’t know if we changed directions now. We don’t know how long Kratia will be able to hold them off...\"\n\"You don’t need to worry about Kratia. Since I already sent reinforcements.\"\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo realized that an undead corps would invade Kehebe, he ordered the three Iron Golems to use the underground passageway to return to the city. If the golems were there, it wouldn’t be too difficult for her to protect herself and fight off the undead.\n\"But we don’t know how large the corps is, so I’m thinking of sending over some ’shields’ as well.\"\n\"Shields? What are you... Ah, aah.\"\nAs expected, Jin was quick on the uptake. When he thought about it, they were headed towards the highlands, where the Bronze Golems lay dormant! From the start, the reason Lee Shin Woo had followed Erian’s words to the letter was because of that!\n\"We’ll arrive soon, so get ready.\"\n\"It doesn’t even feel like it’s been a few minutes. You’re frighteningly fast.\"\nNo matter how often he experienced Jin’s speed, it was always a thrilling and new experience. They arrived in the highlands instantly; the nearest Bronze Golem noticed them and stood up... At that moment, the Steelworker seal floated atop his palm, as if he were an inspector taking out his badge.\n[Welcome, Steelworker.]\n[Welcome.]\n[Welc...]\nAt the same time, he heard the golems’ voices resound in various parts of the highlands! As expected, they seemed to be exactly the same in this one aspect when compared to the Iron Golems. Lee Shin Woo saw all of the numerous Bronze Golems speak in the same voice and stand up. He then immediately commanded them.\n\"Sprint mode! Release mana limiter!\n[Releasing mana limiter. Miniaturizing body as much as possible in order to use sprint mode.]\nUnfortunately, the Bronze Golems didn’t have the ability to significantly downsize their bodies like the Iron Golems. Instead, there was a command that caused them to remove their armaments, and run faster than before; he placed those armaments into Jin’s inventory since he still had space.\nThat speed was truly quick; it was as if they were running a simulation! Jin was speechless and just kept his inventory open. After placing all of their armaments into Jin’s inventory, Lee Shin Woo turned around and yelled vigorously!\n\"Nice. Then let’s go to the city now!\"\n[Following Steelworker!]\n\"You’re always going beyond my expectations.\"\nHundreds of Bronze Golems were forcefully following behind a running horse whilst Lee Shin Woo maintained a human disguise! That’s because there was the possibility that Erian Ruparte could be following behind them.\nHowever, around the halfway point, they were absolutely sure that Erian Ruparte had completely left the area, so Lee Shin Woo released his disguise. Seeing that, Jin asked.\n\"...Shin Woo, are you going to keep acting like a human from now on?\"\n\"At least when we encounter heroes, yeah. Wouldn’t it be easier for us if I acted like a human in front of them?\"\nSo long as he possessed a means to disguise himself as a human being, there was no need to approach as an undead and make them feel repulsed; instead, it would be better to pretend like he was a human. It was fine to interpret that as their inferiority complex.\nHe was doing well as a Skeleton Hero, and was satisfied with himself now; if someone else sympathized with him in this regard, he wouldn’t be able to take it. He didn’t want nor need pointless hostility or consideration.\nYeah, he didn’t want to feel inferior to the other heroes.\n’Though there’s nothing I can do about people like Kratia or Ye Jin Jin who already know, but... I suppose I’ve been lucky.’\nWhether it be good or bad, the two of them both were unaffected by the Underground Empire. Well, they were newbie heroes, so it made sense that he could meet them.\nWhile he was on the topic, Lee Shin Woo requested a private chat with Ye Jin Jin, and told her that he not only met Erian Ruparte, but also successfully fooled her and hid his identity. Hearing that, she got worked up and bothered him by asking how he managed to fool her, but he didn’t have the time to respond.\n[I feel... I feel a living being’s energy! There’s an impudent living being occupying a castle of the Empire!]\n[Attack... For our ever glorious Empire, that living being, ugh, we must kill any who rebels against the Empire!]\nJin had already arrived at the castle walls, where an intense battle was taking place. The three Iron Golems were spread out in a line and in the center of the castle gates, and were taking a beating; countless undead were charging at them and attacking them in order to get into the city.\n\"Whoa...\"\nJin, who’d confirmed the size of the enemy force, spoke discouragingly. It was a huge force of more than 10,000 troops! Though they had defeated about 10,000 soldiers inside the city, the quality of these soldiers was worlds apart!\n’It makes sense that Erian ran away. That’s...?’\nLee Shin Woo could understand why she assumed it was a force directly under the command of the 12 generals. He couldn’t believe his eyes; unbelievably, they were all at least level 3!\nThere was one level 4 Skeleton Knight in command of every one hundred level 3s. Also, ten of those knights were commanded by one level 5. He could understand what ’discipline’ meant now. Even if a few heroes worked together, they couldn’t defeat a force of this size very easily.\n[Undead loyal to the Empire. A powerful living being is inside the city. We should give them the gift of eternal life as well!]\n[Eternal life, the light of the Empire!]\nBut there was something more important above all of them. There was a level 6 elite in the rear giving orders to the entire army and was guarded by level 5s! Lee Shin Woo took a glimpse at the elite; it was seemingly a magician.\n\"...Shin Woo, what are you going to do?\"\n\"For starters, let’s take down the leader.\"\n\"Yeah, I thought you’d say something like that.\"\nSince he’d gotten to level 5, Lee Shin Woo’s confidence soared. It wasn’t even very long since he’d said that he didn’t want to fight head-to-head against a level 6 opponent, yet here he was suggesting that they take down a level 6 elite!\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo had something in mind. If he was up against a physically powerful knight, he would’ve used his Avenger skill and fought after making various preparations. However, what if his enemy was a magician? A magician, whose magic was much higher than their health, honestly lacked in attack power, and he felt as though he could kill it.\n’Though that impenetrable wall of knights guarding him is a problem...’\nMeanwhile, the undead corps were blindly charging the castle walls! Lee Shin Woo instructed Jin to throw all of the Bronze Golems’ armaments onto the floor and ordered the golems to equip them once more.\nBefore the undead corps noticed them, Lee Shin Woo and the golems went their separate ways. The golems dashed forward towards the city walls, while Lee Shin Woo and Jin aimed for their leader.\n\"Let’s distract them with the golems and kill their leader.\"\n\"Will it be ok? It’s a really simple plan.\"\n\"I originally thought about using the golems to take care of those knights, but... we should be fine. I don’t know about the undead army, but Kratia should’ve noticed us by now.\"\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo said so, an enormous clump of ice rose into the air. It was Kratia’s Catalyst Magic!\n\"But doesn’t it look a bit different from last time...?\"\n\"It’d be nice if Kratia knew what I was aiming for, but for now... Jin, run! Shadow Sprint!\"\n\"Hoo... Alright. I’d only die once anyway! Let’s go!\"\nThis was how frightening it was to get used to taking risks! When Lee Shin Woo and Jin were far enough from the golems, Lee Shin Woo simultaneously activated Shadow Sprint and Assimilation. They were instantaneously concealed within the darkness and began to run towards the leader.\nIf they were the only ones here, the undead with good senses might’ve discovered them, but because of the huge clump of ice in the sky, none of the undead were watching their surroundings.\nAnd to add to that...\n[Following Steelworker’s command.]\n[We will lay down our lives to defeat Steelworker’s enemies!]\nHe activated the final command inputted in the Bronze Golems, ’Core Release’ causing the Bronze Golems to dash towards the undead corps. By melting the core, which both produced and managed their mana, they would temporarily be able to exhibit more than their maximum power, and only those with the Steelworker seal could order them to do so!\n[Golems!?]\n[Stop them! The golems are going crazy!]\n’No, this isn’t enough.’\nLee Shin Woo had already taken out his Drake Horn Lance, gripped it, and grit his teeth. Despite the sudden change in the battlefield, the knights didn’t show any signs of moving from the magician’s side.\nEven if the Bronze Golems exploded all at once and attacked the knights, what would happen if they couldn’t break through? When an ambush is no longer an ambush, it becomes a greeting at best. If they got surrounded by the knights, then it would get tough for even Lee Shin Woo. A level 6 magician’s spells would be even more troublesome.\n[Grand Ice Spear!]\n\"Huh...!?\"\nHowever, when Lee Shin Woo was thinking about how he would get past the knights and attack the magician, the floating clump of ice slowly began to change its form. Hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of ice crystals stuck to the clump of ice and formed into a single enormous spear!\nIt wasn’t a large-scale spell meant to attack the entire undead corps. That overwhelmingly cold clump of ice was aiming for only one enemy. It was aiming for none other than this army’s leader, the Ghoul Wizard!\n\"Is that her way of saying that she won’t lose it to us?\"\n\"Uhh... Maybe. Probably not.\"\nThe knights, who protected the magician, tensed, and drew their swords; they changed their battle formation and now there were Skeleton Magicians in between the knights. Lee Shin Woo exerted strength into his grip and now all he needed was the right opportunity.\n\"In any case, there’s one thing I’m sure of.\"\nLee Shin Woo aimed his lance at the magician’s head, stiffened his chin, and smiled.\n\"We’ll start this battle off by taking out the leader.\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 18. Corps Destroyer - 2>\nAround the time Kratia was able to somewhat use the Limited Order Bone Core, the core vibrated and the three Iron Golems came back. She obviously thought that Lee Shin Woo and Jin would return with them, but that wasn’t the case.\n[Steelworker ordered us to return first and protect Kratia Melloi.]\n[Henceforth, we will obey the core’s orders. Our top priority is to protect Kratia Melloi.]\n\"Shin Woo’s not back and it’s just you guys...?\"\nShe wanted a more detailed explanation, but so long as the golems had their orders, they wouldn’t say anything more. Still, if there was one thing she realized, it was that Lee Shin Woo was worried about her safety and had sent the golems to protect her. In other words, something dangerous was coming towards this city.\n’As long as I know that, it’s fine.’\nThen, she drew out her magic and focused on the Orb of Eternal Ice, the growing ice artifact she’d gotten from God. One second of her preparation would mean the death of 100 enemy soldiers.\nWhen she was almost finished with her task, she sensed the huge force of undead on the move. Not only was it indeed a huge army, but she could easily tell that each and every one of the undead were elites.\n\"How did Shin Woo know about this...? No, I shouldn’t be surprised at this point.\"\nKratia thought of that villainous skeleton and shook her head.\nShe thought that what he’d shown her thus far was certainly impressive, but she was well aware that there was a lot he still hadn’t shown her. However, what was most impressive was his imagination and his mental condition, which allowed him to limitlessly expand the ways in which he could use magic.\n’If he was a magician, he would’ve been a legend.’\nIt was so unfortunate. Kratia clicked her tongue and meticulously examined the undead force. The force was mostly comprised of level 3 undead, which she didn’t need to worry about, but she had to be a bit on guard against the level 4 Skeleton Knights and Skeleton Magicians. Obviously more so when it came to the level 5 Elder Knights.\n\"Protect the front gates. Keeping that safe is the same as keeping me safe.\"\n[Judged as a rational command. Following order.]\n[Following the core’s command.]\nKratia realized that it would become tough for her if the undead got through the front gates and into the city, so she hurriedly commanded the Iron Golems.\nLee Shin Woo had already released all their limitations, so even if the Elder Knights attacked them all at once, they would last for several minutes.\n\"Mm.\" The most update n0vels are published on noᴠelfire.net\nShe dispatched the golems and stood atop the walls, but when she noticed the level 6 elite, her face stiffened. Its skin was extremely pale, like an emissary of death, but its body was filled with mana!\nIt was neither a zombie nor a skeleton; if it wasn’t for the artificial sunlight, she might’ve thought it wasn’t dead. It barely retained what could be considered a human form, and the power she sensed from the undead was considerable.\n’A ghoul... That’s a ghoul. Plus, it’s eaten several corpses and regained its reasoning. When I consider that magic pattern... could it be a Ghoul Wizard!?’\nThe Ghoul Wizard was located furthest in the back and was guarded by level 5 Elder Knights, so that couldn’t just be a coincidence. At that moment, Kratia realized how dangerous this corps was. They not only had a solid system of command, but also a clear goal; it wasn’t an army that had turned undead, but rather, an army composed of undead!\nOf course, the undead that inhabited this city, Kehebe, had relied on their memories to maintain an army, but the difference between this city’s undead and them was like the difference between a sleepwalking patient and a normal person.\n’If that’s the case, I have to take out the leader first. If he gets closer to the walls, it’ll become tough. But because those knights are guarding him like an impenetrable wall...’\nThere was no way to retreat; it would all be decided with a single spell between magicians. If she couldn’t kill him with her spell, she would lose.\nCurrently, she’d discovered the enemy first, and had already gathered her magic, so Kratia looked like she was in the lead, but it was already prepared for an ambush, as the knights guarded it. No matter how she attacked, she would have to deal with the knights first.\nIf that’s the case, did she even have a means of dealing with both the knights and the wizard in a single blow? It would be possible if she developed her Catalyst Magic some more, but she had just created the spell, so that was impossible right now.\n’If Shin Woo were level 6, he would’ve been able to do it.’\nKratia thought she wouldn’t lose to anyone in terms of talent, but she naturally thought this. She was just amused with herself.\nHowever, she also thought that if she didn’t accept reality, she wouldn’t be able to progress in the future. Because of that, rather than feeling inferior, she felt a greater desire to improve herself. When a magician accepts that something is not impossible, they are then able to make the impossible possible.\n’He sent the golems already, so Shin Woo should be coming. If that’s the case, I just need to last until he comes. I can keep them from getting close to the walls by using my Catalyst Magic.’\nShe didn’t even think about running away. Kratia was fundamentally a hero, and diligently performed her duty as one; plus, she wasn’t the type to get scared when she didn’t even know how the battle would turn out.\n[Crush the golems!]\n[The golems protecting the living are our enemies!]\n[Executing the trespasser!]\nThen, the undead vanguard clashed with the golems. Of course, level 3 undead couldn’t beat the golems and were helplessly crushed, but the problem was that there were thousands of them attacking!\n\"Sseup, it can’t be helped.\"\nKratia grit her teeth and came forward. Her Eternal Ice floated in the air, and the mana in the entire area was influenced by her own. She would stop them, even if it meant freezing the entire wall! However, as she bravely resolved herself, she saw something.\n\"Golems...?\"\nHundreds of level 4 golems were charging with considerable speed. Were they aiming for the wall? No way. Their destination was clear. They locked on to the level 4 and level 5 knights and were attacking them! There were way too many of them to just make a dent in their formation!\n’Then that means...’\nKratia hurriedly turned her gaze. She had studied his magic for the past ten days, so she could sense a faint presence from beyond. He was... not fighting together with the golems! Lee Shin Woo was charging straight for the leader!\n’He really is bold. [1]’\nAh, there’s bold, and then there’s Lee Shin Woo bold. She thought that if she were to tell Lee Shin Woo that, she would get hit, and instantaneously modified her spell.\nShe knew now that both of their goals were the same, so she had no reason to hesitate. If they both struck the boss, one of them should succeed!\n[Grand Ice Spear!]\nHer miraculous artifact absorbed the world’s mana, and gradually chilled the area; through her deep study of magic, she could agglomerate mana and change it with frighteningly high efficiency. Finally, using those two as a catalyst, she changed the world’s mana and clumped it together, creating a giant ice spear that went beyond a level 6’s ability.\n\"Hoo... Heup!\"\nAfter taking a short deep breath, she poured all of her mana into the ice spear and shot it in a straight line towards the wizard. The midair ice spear homed in on the Ghoul Wizard’s magic, and sped up like crazy!\n[The living being’s attack is coming. Move it!]\n[As you command!]\n[We’re protecting the Third Corps Commander! Get to your positions!]\n[Don’t look down on our defense zone!]\nThe Elder Knights in Kehebe had looked as though they had run off far away; on the other hand, when these Elder Knights heard the ghoul’s command, they really did look like knights of the Empire, as they stepped forward to protect the Corps Commander.\nThey would eliminate anything that came in close proximity to their defense zone; if one knight couldn’t cover an area by himself, another knight would help, creating a tight perimeter around the Corps Commander. That was the reason the Empire’s knights were powerful.\n’A defense zone... I knew about this since I’ve roughly absorbed their memories, but I suppose that’s how you make it, huh.’\nEven Lee Shin Woo, who was running straight for the magician, was impressed seeing them. At the same time, he thought that he’d be able to add an element to that to make an even more perfect defense. At the very least, there was some value in trying it out once!\n’But not now.’\nFinally, the Grand Ice Spear struck their defensive zone. The knights at the forefront died without a trace, without even being given a chance to retaliate. However, the knights on standby behind them shaved a bit of it with their spears and the third row of Elder Knights were able to cut even more of it, managing to slow down the speed of the Grand Ice Spear.\n[Knights who pledged their loyalty to the Empire. We will attain victory through your sacrifice! Show that impudent living being how frightening and powerful black magic is!]\nThe Ghoul Wizard watched as the knights were sacrificed and began casting a spell. He traced the ice spear back to its source, Kratia, and was casting a spell to intercept her.\nHowever, right before he completed the spell, while the knights were busy with the ice spear, Lee Shin Woo forcefully shot his lance at the completely wide open Ghoul Wizard’s back!\n\"I see your backkkkkkkkkkk!\"\nAll the conditions for his ambush had been met. From the start, the Ghoul Wizard’s target wasn’t Lee Shin Woo, but the living being, Kratia. His subordinates were busy with the Iron Golems, Bronze Golems, or the Grand Ice Spear, so they couldn’t check their surroundings, and the Ghoul Wizard was likewise busy casting a spell to intercept Kratia.\nFurthermore, his Shadow Sprint, using Assimilation as a base, was much too perfect such that even Lee Shin Woo lost sight of where he was. However.\n[So there was an undead who wasn’t loyal to the Empire!]\nDespite that, the split second that Lee Shin Woo threw his lance, the Ghoul Wizard diverted all of his magic to defense and blocked Lee Shin Woo’s attack.\nTo be more exact, the Ghoul Wizard possessed an ability that automatically diverted his mana to defense when it was hit. The spell seemed to consume at least 30% of his mana, but he still had an awful lot of mana!\n[Critical Hit!]\nDozens of layers of mana shields formed in the extremely small gap between the Ghoul Wizard’s head and the lance; the force behind the lance, as well as Bursting Thunder’s lightning was canceled out by the shields.\nThe moment they crashed into another, at least half of the shields instantly broke and the remaining shields broke one by one. But at this time, Lee Shin Woo realized that his ambush had failed. That’s because there wasn’t enough force remaining in the lance to pierce through the wizard’s head and kill him.\n’Damn it...!’\nAs expected of a level 6 enemy! Lee Shin Woo gritted his teeth and prepared to follow through; in the middle of preparing his next attack, the Ghoul Wizard pushed aside the lance before his head and yelled as loud as he could.\n[Protect me from that coward who ambushed me from the rear...!]\n\"How about this!?\"\n[Kuheok!?]\nHowever, the knights didn’t come back in time. The lance broke through all of the shields and had seemingly lost all of its power, yet somehow forcefully shot forward like a cannonball; the Ghoul Wizard was pushed into the air!\nObviously, this was done through Lee Shin Woo’s Rule of Bone; this was the result of him controlling the bone.\n[You bastardddddddddddd!]\nThe Ghoul Wizard had invested all its mana into the shields, so he couldn’t resist properly, and was thrown into the air. In an instant, the lance pushed the ghoul hundreds of meters into the air! That sight was akin to seeing fireworks being shot into the sky.\n\"Man, that ghoul sure is flying.\"\n[Rescue the Corps Commander!]\nThe knights who had survived the Grand Ice Spear didn’t think about attacking the ambusher, Lee Shin Woo; rather, they each jumped into the air to save the Corps Commander. When they became about level 5, they may not be able to use magic, but they could at least jump hundreds of meters high no problem!\nA few of the knights were able to jump high enough to barely touch the Corps Commander with their hands. Obviously, at that time, Lee Shin Woo exploded the lance! With all of the mana he had left remaining!\n[Critical Hit!]\nThe explosion was truly magnificent. The lance, tinged in his dark red mana, split into hundreds of thousands of pieces and scattered!\nSince the lance had already pierced halfway through him, the ghoul couldn’t block at all, and broke into bits and pieces. The nearby Elder Knights were also heavily injured and helplessly fell to the ground. Lee Shin Woo looked up at the fancy explosion, seemingly blinded from it, and spoke enthusiastically.\n\"Man, you really got to look at fireworks from below.\"\n\"It doesn’t matter whether you look at it from below or from the side. Remember, that thing ain’t a firework.\"\nJin, who had focused all his efforts into charging with Lee Shin Woo, replied in a discouraged voice.\nThey’d somehow managed to kill the Corps Commander. All he had to do now was to somehow get through this outrageous number of undead with no mana and get away.\n[1] T/N: She actually uses the common Korean idiom of one’s liver being outside their belly, which means they’re bold/reckless. The next sentence literally talks about how all of one’s inner organs would have to out of their body to be like Lee Shin Woo, but I already translated the idiom to English.",

    "content": "<Chapter 18. Corps Destroyer - 3>\n[With superb teamwork, you and your comrade managed to ambush and kill a Corps Commander of 10,000! All stats have increased by 2. The Low Rank Command skill has become Lv9.]\nThe moment they were sure of the Corps Commander’s demise, Lee Shin Woo moved quickly, as he didn’t have a moment to spare to read the message. They had one thing left to do before the knights and soldiers surrounded them: collect the loot!\n\"I don’t have any mana, so I’m counting on you Jin! We have to collect it all before we leave!\"\n\"You’re such a slave driver!\"\n[Grab him and bring him to his knees before he escapes! We cannot bring shame to Sir Metafel’s name!]\nHe’d killed the Corps Commander, who had been in the middle of them, right before their very (nonexistent) eyes, so the knights who were responsible for guarding him were enraged.\nAt the very least, it was a relief that most of the level 5 knights were dead, but the entire force was concentrated on Lee Shin Woo and Jin, so how could Lee Shin Woo even suggest that they collect all of the loot and get through them!?\n\"Even so, we have to get the loot!\"\n\"SSeup... I guess it can’t be helped!\"\nJin resolved himself and sprinted at full speed towards the glittering Perium and bones that fell from the sky. He utilized Steel Heart to create sharp horns atop his head, and plowed through the skeletons that swarmed them from all sides!\nJin’s considerable speed, as well as the cutting force behind Steel Heart worked as one, destroying level 4 Skeleton Knights with ease. It was such a cheat skill that he wouldn’t have to be jealous of most other heroes’ blessing.\n\"Now... Jump!\"\n\"Heup!\"\nIt truly goes to show how far the Drake Horn Lance had pushed the Corps Commander and the Elder Knights into the air as the loot they left behind was still falling from the sky.\nJin, who somehow managed to move freely through the undead group unscathed, jumped at his signal; with his shocking leg strength, he instantaneously reached the loot. Lee Shin Woo, who had been waiting for that moment, quickly reached out his hand and collected the loot.\n[You have acquired the Lv6 Ghoul Wizard - Vitas’ skull.]\n[You have acquired 950,000 Perium.]\n[You have acquired a Lv4 Corrupted Guide’s Staff. Through Bone Reinforcement, the weapon transforms, and has become a Lv4 Bifurcated Snake Spine.]\n[You have acquired the Lv5 Skeleton Elder Knight - Veron’s jawbone.]\n[You have acquired the Lv5 Skeleton Elder Knight - Turain’s...]\nLee Shin Woo firmly planted himself on Jin’s back, and then wildly stretched out his hands, holding the loot in his arms whilst inspecting the ground.\nThere were some knights that had followed suit and jumped behind them, as well as soldiers shooting arrows and magicians casting magic at them; with just a quick glance, he could tell all of the undead force was aiming at them.\n[Kill them!]\n[The living is our enemy. And that undead... in any case, just kill him!]\n[You’re already dead!] [1]\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo stayed firm, despite receiving the murderous looks of more than 10,000 undead. His body, which had been completely empty of mana due to exploding the Drake Horn Lance, was slowly generating new mana. Intermediate Mana Bone was indiscriminately gathering the surrounding mana.\nSoon, he gathered enough mana to use a skill. And Lee Shin Woo had already chosen what skill he’d use.\n\"You’ll soon find out who the hell you’re messing with!\"\n\"Hoo.\"\nJin predicted what Lee Shin Woo was going to do, and just decided to not worry about it and be calm. Yeah, it might be better to think about where he needed to land for them to survive after Lee Shin Woo uses his skill.\nJin’s goblin fire rolled around and while he looked for the best place to land, Lee Shin Woo finally opened his mouth.\n\"You bald headed bastards! Listen to me; I’m the one who killed your Corps Commander!\"\n\"You’re bald too!\"\nEven Jin, who had been composed, couldn’t help but retort! Lee Shin Woo was forgetting himself; his high pitched yell resounded far throughout the battlefield, causing more than 3,000 undead to flinch!\n[You used Shriek of the Dead, causing your enemies to fall into a confused and fearful state.]\n[You used the skill to great success! With such a perfect provocation, the skill’s effectiveness and range have increased! You have succeeded in making a portion of the enemies lose their minds, and their fear temporarily puts them into an obedient state! The Low Rank Shriek of the Dead skill has become Lv9. Magic has increased by 3.]\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo invoked two unexpected effects. Shriek of the Dead’s range was much wider than usual and broke down the minds of the undead in that vast area! Not only that, they were affected by a new status ailment!\n[Bald!?]\n[C-Corps Commander!]\n[The Corps Commander is alive!]\nEven Lee Shin Woo, the one who used the skill, couldn’t believe what was happening causing his goblin fire to flicker. The center of the battlefield gradually was filled with shock, terror, and groans.\n[Kuaaaak! Who the hell called me bald!?]\n[It was you! You still have some hair left!]\n[I-It’s a helmet! I’m telling you it’s a helmet! Damn it, you crazy bastard!]\nThere were two reasons his skill was such a resounding success. The first was extremely simple. While people weren’t really receptive of his compliments, it seemed as though they were more receptive to his insults; they responded more sensitively to his insults and each and every one of those undead was affected by his skill!\n[Who insulted the Corps Commander!?]\n[The Corps Commander isn’t dead. He’s right over there!]\n[The Corps Commander has said the word. That we must kill you bastards who are rebelling against the Empire!]\nThe second reason was the current situation. The Corps Commander was dead and Lee Shin Woo tormented them with the term ’Corps Commander’; as a result, a portion of the confused and fearful undead actually considered Lee Shin Woo the Corps Commander and began mobilizing!\n\"This is... quite the new discovery. I need to do more research on it.\"\n\"Research? What the hell do you mean research!?\"\nLee Shin Woo, who’d originally thought that all he needed to do was scream for Shriek of the Dead, thought that this was a chance to change his mind.\nOf course, Jin simply thought Lee Shin Woo picked that offensive term to piss off the undead, but was speechless seeing what Lee Shin Woo had wrought!\n\"In any case, it’s become easier for us to land now!\"\n\"That’s true, but... hold on tight!\"\n[A horse is plummeting from the sky!]\n[What the hell are you talking about... Kuheok!]\nJin, who’d already figured out where he’d land, straightened his front two legs and descended. The steel thorns that protruded from the ends of his legs cleaved through the skeletons en route to his landing spot, and they safely landed on the ground. It was truly a clean landing! However, Jin didn’t have the time to admire his perfect landing as he started running again.\n\"We’ll be safe if we get to the spot where the golems are clumped together!\"\n\"Heup...!\"\n[Stop right there, you louts! We’ll definitely get revenge for the Corps Commander, kuak!]\n[Don’t you dare speak the Corps Commander’s name with that dirty mouth of yours!]\nIt was a skill that targeted thousands of undead. Although it was a resounding success, he couldn’t put all of the level 4 Skeleton Knights in the various areas into a confused state.\nHowever, even if there were skeletons unaffected by the Shriek of the Dead, they still didn’t possess the ability to restore the sanity of the crazy undead. Even if there were skeletons that were still lucid and attacked Lee Shin Woo and Jin, they would be blocked by the other skeletons.\n[Dark Arrow! Pure darkness, punish those who have become corrupted and forgotten the curse!]\n\"Magic!? Jin, dodge...\"\n[Corps Commander, we’ll take care of this!]\n[Kuaaak!]\n\"...\"\nEven if they were magically attacked by Skeleton Wizards, there were similarly some who were afflicted by the obedience status ailment, and would block the magic attack, counterattack, and kill the wizards...\n\"Wait a sec.\"\n\"You...\"\nLee Shin Woo gave the signal and Jin instinctually stopped running. They were still quite far off from the golem troops, but he felt like he understood why Lee Shin Woo asked him to stop.\n\"Please tell me you’re not doing what I think you are.\"\n\"I think I can do it, don’t you?\"\n\"But the skill’s effect is only temporary!\"\nEven so, Jin didn’t move an inch. The hostile skeletons that approached in all directions lost their lives to the skeletons who considered them their Corps Commander. Honestly speaking... they didn’t really need to run away.\n\"Listen, Jin. I’m at an important juncture right now. My skill’s potential is limitless, and it’s my job to choose which direction the skill develops. I can definitely do it now, like when we’d created the Assimilation skill together.\"\n\"I was really proud of the Assimilation skill, but hearing you say that makes me hate myself.\"\nA skill was like a living organism; depending on the way it’s used, its characteristics, mana, and goal would change.\nThe Horseback Riding skill, which just made his riding companion run faster, evolving into the ridiculous Assimilation skill, and Stealth evolving into Shadow Sprint was all because of that.\nAnd as those skill went from the low rank level to the intermediate level, they went through a dramatic change. Lee Shin Woo thought that Shriek of the Dead could likewise do the same.\n\"Maybe this skill will evolve to best match my karma, the Joker.\"\n\"You...\"\n[Corps Commander! I’ll assist you!]\nAt that moment, an obedient Skeleton Knight approached him. Lee Shin Woo looked at him and replied extremely naturally.\n\"Rebels have infiltrated into our corps. Lead those who will follow your orders and quickly kill them. Once you’re done cleaning up, I’ll give you your next order.\"\n[I understand, Corps Commander! Follow me, proud soldiers of the Empire! Let’s go kill those maggots slandering the Corps Commander!]\n\"...\"\nAnyone who saw this would think that Lee Shin Woo had been in charge of this corps for about 5 years, as he commanded in such a haughty and firm tone! Lee Shin Woo replied naturally, and the Skeleton Knight had certainly recognized Lee Shin Woo as his superior, taking a more active role in this battle than before!\n[Corps Commander!]\n[How dare you mention the Corps Commander... Kuheok!]\n[Corps Commander. Please command me as well!]\nThen, the number of undead willing to follow his orders had increased significantly. Those who had been in a confused and fearful state saw their allies follow his orders and became his troops as well!\n\"Yeah... You heard me too, right? Take care of the sane soldiers! Show those traitors the might of the Empire!\"\n[As you command!]\n[I will follow your order!]\nSeeing that, Lee Shin Woo suddenly felt like he saw the ’confused’ state in a different light. Until now, he’d used Shriek of the Dead to make the monsters fight amongst themselves, and thought that that was the only way he could use it, but felt like that was completely wrong.\n’I was too complacent. While it was originally a monster’s skill, when it became mine it changed.’\nHe thought he’d developed in several ways after coming to this world, but he was still far off. If it was him, who possessed both the Acting and Disguise skills, he should be able to do more than just ’confuse’ them, and was speechless at the fact that he’d wasted all the opportunities to do so.\n\"But it doesn’t matter. Since I can just figure it out now.\"\n\"You really are going to start...\"\nIt still wasn’t too late. Especially since Shriek of the Dead was at low rank level 9 and was about to level up; he thought he was lucky. Lee Shin Woo sported a smile and took a stance. The Corps Commander’s bone in his hand naturally melted away and was absorbed.\n[Initiating Bone Reinforcement by consuming the Lv6 Ghoul Wizard - Vitas’ skull. Magic has increased by 8. The Intermediate Mana Bone skill has become Lv3. Magic has increased by 10. Low Rank Fire element has become Lv6. Magic has increased by 6. Absorbing a portion of the target’s experiences and memories.]\n[General, I’m just a magician, and I’m not good enough to lead one of your corps. ...If you still wish for me to shoulder such a heavy responsibility, then I can only promise you one thing. Our corps will never lose until the day I die. - Mercenary Magician Vitas]\n’It’s impossible to perfectly disguise myself as the Ghoul Wizard by just absorbing this bone, but my acting will be much more convincing now.’\nHe wondered at what level his Disguise skill would have to be for him to perfectly disguise himself by just absorbing a single bone. Lee Shin Woo thought inquisitively and grinned. And then he yelled.\n\"Before we are soldiers of the Empire, we are mercenaries who follow the Mercenary King, Sir Metafel! Show those ruffians who dirty that name the strength and ferocity of true mercenaries!\"\n[You used Shriek of the Dead, causing a portion of the enemies to fall into a confused and fearful state!]\n[A resounding success! Most of the enemies who have fallen into a confused and fearful state have become obedient! The skill’s range has expanded uncontrollably!]\nHe used the information from the absorbed bone and provoked the undead with a single comment, upending the entire battlefield!\n[Ooooooooooooooh!]\n[As you command, Corps Commander!]\n[Ugh, the Corps Commander truly is...!]\n[Metafel! Metafel!]\nLee Shin Woo’s comment had confused even the once sane undead! Another factor was that not a lot of undead could see him because there were so many of them.\nThus, the chaos spread uncontrollably... eventually, around 3,000 undead were temporarily placed into an obedient state.\nThis was the moment when the largest civil war since the heroes entered the Empire occurred.\n[1] E/N: ref: Omae wa mou shindeiru\nThe latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the novel·fire·net",

    "content": "<Chapter 18. Corps Destroyer - 4>\n\"What is this...?\"\nKratia’s grand magic had fulfilled her objective of killing the knights protecting the Corps Commander, and she safely retrieved the Eternal Ice, which served as the core for the ice spear. By the time she had enough time to sigh, the battle had already become a complete mess.\n\"Listen up everyone! Don’t even dream of national security if you can’t even restore discipline within the army! Show no mercy. Kill those who defy my command!\"\nLee Shin Woo and Kratia had worked together to kill the Corps Commander and that had gone well, but contrary to her expectations, he didn’t run away. Rather, Lee Shin Woo had entered into the undead force and was vigorously spewing out lies.\nKratia gazed at Lee Shin Woo, who looked even more noticeable atop an imposing steel horse (from the outside, Jin looked completely like a steel war horse), and was speechless. However, what was even more stunning was the fact that each and every word he said riled up the huge undead force.\n[The Corps Commander has given the command! Those who insult the Corps Commander are guilty and sentenced to death!]\n[Don’t listen to that strange skeleton! He’s tricking you all right now!]\n[To think you’re still spouting that nonsense! Kill them!]\nWhy were undead he didn’t even know following his orders, and why were there so many of them following him!?\nWhat’s worse, whenever Lee Shin Woo shouted, more undead followed his command. Kratia sensed traces of magic that affected their minds.\n[Y-You fools...! Just look at him! He’s neither a ghoul nor a magician!]\n[How dare you suspect the Corps Commander; I feel like a fool for following you until now!]\n[He’s the Corp Commander’s enemy too! Execute him in Sir Metafel’s name!]\nThe high ranked level 5 undead weren’t affected by Lee Shin Woo’s shallow machinations, but the problem was their subordinates, who originally followed their orders. Lee Shin Woo boosted their morale through the Command skill, and they were unfortunately bewitched by Lee Shin Woo’s words, and attacked their previous superiors!\n\"What is that guy doing...\"\nShe wasn’t saying that because she didn’t know what he was doing; she was saying that because she couldn’t believe what he’d done. Lee Shin Woo was swaying and breaking up the army through a perverse method!\nTo think he’d be pretending to be the Corps Commander after killing him right in front of them; and to think that it was working! Because Lee Shin Woo read the mood and the flow of the battle, he was able to control that flow.\nWhat should she even call him? If she were to give him a title, she would call him a ’Joker’.\n[Attacks against the walls have decreased.]\n[Located Steelworker. Checking with core owner first. May we go back to guarding Steelworker?]\nKratia wasn’t the only one who noticed the unexpected change in the battlefield. The Iron Golems, who had been protecting the walls and ready to give their lives in its defense, noticed that the attacks against the walls had lessened.\nPlus, they noticed Lee Shin Woo on the battlefield, so they requested Kratia’s permission to return to his side. The invaders wouldn’t have the energy to attack the walls any longer, so Kratia unhesitatingly sent the Iron Golems on their way.\n\"Ah, you can go now.\"\n[Returning to protect Steelworker. Destroying structures that get in the way.]\n[How dare you, kuheok!]\n[Charging! Killing anything in the way!]\n[In the name of Steelworker!]\nIt was as if they were waiting for that very moment as they immediately turned around; they indiscriminately killed the undead and charged directly towards Lee Shin Woo.\nThe Iron Golems, which were superb when compared to other level 5 elites, charged side by side. The infighting undead couldn’t stop them and were pushed back! It was as if they were erasing the undead with an eraser!\n[Reaching core limit. Self-destructing core!]\n[Self-destructing core!]\nWhereas the level 4 Bronze Golems, which had recklessly charged into the undead force to repel them, reached their limit by the ones and twos and executed their final coded command: self-destruct. The surrounding undead were swept away by the explosions and were crushed, falling to the ground in flames.\n[Self-destructing!]\n[Keoheok! They’re exploding!]\n[Magicians, stop the flames!]\nThe Bronze Golems exploded in various parts of the battlefield, spreading both fire and chaos. It was difficult for the entire corps working together to deal with the explosions, but since this all occurred while they were fighting amongst themselves, the damage was maximized.\n[Ah, is that Captain over there!?]\n[The Captain’s in danger!]\n[Let’s save our Captain! Let’s give peace to the imperial army who’ve lost their reasoning!]\n[Huh...? Paul Zero!]\n[Paul Zero’s a good person. I’ll help in saving him as well!]\nHowever, there were guys trying to get in the middle of all the chaos; they were none other than the Pauls, who temporary left Lee Shin Woo to grow! What’s worse, their numbers had doubled. The other Pauls must’ve been drawn to them and joined up!\n[Let them rest in peace!]\n[Paul Zero!]\n[Captain’s over there!]\nAlthough they were up against an undead force nearing 10,000 strong, they didn’t submit and entered the battle; they emitted their poison, curse, and dark magic, and swung their weapons. The twelve level 4 elites led a force of 40 elite undead, causing a commotion!\n[Rescue the Captain!]\n[The Corps Commander is alive!]\n[Paul Zero!]\n[Self-destructing core!]\n[That guy’s not the Corps Commander. He’s not... ugh!]\n[Protecting Steelworker!]\nThus, they just babbled on and gathered in one place, creating a absurd ruckus. Of course, all that commotion was focused around Lee Shin Woo. It really was a mess.\n\"Phew... it’s chaos.\"\nKratia watched the chaos unfold and thought about whether she would have a chance to intervene, but no matter how she thought about it, things would be settled without her having to get involved.\n\"...Let’s just meditate.\"\nIn the end, she began to meditate in a safe spot. She decided to gather some mana for now, but she wasn’t sure that there would come a time where she needed to use it.\n[The Low Rank Command skill has become Lv10, and evolves into the intermediate level. You can now command several subordinates at once. You can protect your subordinates from mental ailments. All stats have increased by 3.]\nOn the other hand, Lee Shin Woo, who was in the very center of that chaos, ordered the undead whilst killing those that approached, while moving hectically.\nAround that time, his once depleted mana was replenished and he could wield the Lightning Tooth again, but he didn’t do so. Instead, he wielded the transformed staff, the ’Bifurcated Snake Spine’ that he’d gotten off the Corps Commander.\n[Bifurcated Snake Spine]\n[Lv4]\n[Durability: 950/950]\n[Attack Power: 280 - 420]\n[Magic Attack Power: 400 - 500]\n[Options: Magic +40, Calculation assistance]\n[Passive skills: Elemental reversal - Absorbs an element and releases the opposite element.]\nThe staff likely had a different ability ordinarily, but he couldn’t know anymore. Regardless, Lee Shin Woo was quite satisfied with the transformed staff. It was something that could normally only be wielded by magicians, but he could also use it, as one who could wield the elements themselves!\n’The owner of this staff, the Corps Commander Vitas, was originally a mercenary, yet was a genius to be able to use such clean and pure elemental magic. And his staff likely helps in casting elemental magic as well...’ Fınd the newest release on novel※fire.net\nKnowing that much was enough. It looked different from Vitas’, but if the magic he used looked similar, then it would be beneficial in confusing the skeletons! And the elemental magic that Vitas used most when he was still alive was...\n\"I’ll freeze you all! Frozen Cloud!\"\n[It’s here. The Corps Commander’s technique! To think I’d be able to see it once more!]\n[Once used, that technique would freeze everything aside from allies!]\nThe skeletons who heard Lee Shin Woo’s high pitched scream were elated and yelled. Of course, Lee Shin Woo couldn’t use magic like Frozen Cloud. He would just stuff the fire element into the staff and the other fork would spit out ice!\nFortunately, he had a superb control over mana, and had caught a few glances of frozen clouds in Vitas’ memories, so he was able to spread the cold mana into a similar shape. He’d infused quite a bit of mana inside, and the result was truly astounding; hundreds of undead troops were completely frozen solid!\n[H-how can this be? Was he truly the Corps Commander all along...!?]\n[That power; that range! How could that be anything but the Corps Commander’s strength!?]\nIt was the result he’d been expecting. The undead in fearful and confused states saw Lee Shin Woo’s poor imitation (though Lee Shin Woo thought it was a poor imitation, his extraordinary aptitude in mana caused his spread of the ice element look like a perfect Frozen Cloud) and were completely fooled!\n[I will follow your commands, Corps Commander!]\n[C-Corps Commander...!]\n[How can this be. How can this be... Kuaak!]\nThose who’d followed him in an obedient state were more sure than ever that he was the Corps Commander, and those who were confused, but not obedient turned obedient after seeing that magic once. Those who were neither confused nor obedient were both shocked and flustered, so they were just attacked and fell.\nRather than the magic’s power, the magic’s symbolism was a more effective large-scale attack. His skill reflected that success as well.\n[The Acting skill has become Lv12. Your acting ability has become even greater. You feel something supernatural moderately improving your acting ability.]\nSomething supernatural, huh. That may actually be the case. Lee Shin Woo grinned and yelled to finish things up.\n\"Punish all those who attempted to dirty Sir Metafel’s will with their vile machinations! We are the forces under the direct command of the Mercenary King!\"\n[Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\n[The Corps Commander has spoken! Punish them all!]\nHis scream resounded out, covering all of the enemy forces this time! Just because they were in range of his skill didn’t mean that they would inevitably be affected by it, but Lee Shin Woo’s shout just now was able to bring around half of the undead troops to his side.\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo successfully dirtied Sir Metafel’s name through his vile machinations to attain victory...!\n[The Low Rank Shriek of the Dead skill has become Lv10 and has evolved into the intermediate level. You have continued to train this skill, which is nothing more than a mere scream; by doing so, you can utilize your karma to its maximum potential. You have created a skill whereby any who hear your cry will become dizzy and confused, and you may order them around as you please. The Joker’s innate skill, Instigate has been born! All stats have increased by 10!]\n\"A innate skill, huh. Heh, everything is going according to plan.\"\n\"Stop lying...\"\nHe thought it’d be interconnected with the Joker karma, but he didn’t think he’d create an innate skill all on his own. Lee Shin Woo muttered, being unable to contain his pride. On the other hand, Jin retorted with an incredibly composed voice.\nIt didn’t even take 2 hours before the battle had come to its end, and the skeletons went back to where they belonged.",

    "content": "<Chapter 18. Corps Destroyer - 5>\nAround the time Lee Shin Woo decided that there weren’t any more enemies left remaining and lowered his Bifurcated Snake Spine, a message appeared before him stating that the battle was over.\n[You have defeated a corps under the direct command of the 12 generals! You have acquired 3 permits to God’s secret shop. All stats have increased by 10. Proficiency in all combat related skills has increased. The Intermediate Combat Sense skill has become Lv5, and Agility has increased by 10.]\n[You single-handedly manipulated the corps and ultimately destroyed it. Your achievement is unbelievable. You have acquired the title, ’Corps Destroyer’. All stats have increased by 20. Whenever you fight against a force of at least 1,000, the effectiveness of all skills increases by 30%.]\nLee Shin Woo could only laugh upon seeing that his achievement had increased his stats by a total of 80. If he added in God’s reward, then his stats had increased by 120! [1]\nIf he told his seniors about this... No, even if he were to tell Kratia, who was up on that wall, she wouldn’t believe him.\n\"Corps Destroyer, huh. That’s my kind of title.\"\n\"You weren’t really the one doing the destroying, though...\"\nJin recollected the chaos and destruction Lee Shin Woo had caused and shook his head. Lee Shin Woo clicked his (nonexistent) tongue and Jin ridiculed him.\n\"Well, what matters is that we cleaned everything up nicely.\"\n\"That kind of result-oriented thinking is what makes kids with so many dreams feel so wronged. ...Though it was clean.\"\nBecause Lee Shin Woo had split the undead force into two and made them fight against each other, all of them had died.\nTo be honest, that wasn’t completely accurate, but during the chaos, Lee Shin Woo had either taken care of them himself, or had the golems take care of it; ultimately, he was satisfyingly able to ensure mutual destruction!\n[Completed task. Standing by.]\n[Absorbing mana to restore damaged parts.]\nThe level 4 Bronze Golems had sacrificed their cores, so they had been completely annihilated, but the level 5 Iron Golems were different; they either killed the level 5 undead or began to fight seriously once the undead were afflicted with status ailments, so they were safe.\nThough their armaments were heavily damaged, they would automatically be restored when they replenished their mana. Of course, it would probably take quite a bit of time, but it was much better than them being completely destroyed.\n\"Good work. Rest and replenish your mana.\"\n[It’s an honor.]\n[Captain!]\nLee Shin Woo knocked on the Iron Golems and complimented them. At that moment, the final participants of the battle approached him. They were the Pauls.\n[Captain, are you alright!?]\n[Paul Zero!]\n\"Ah, they were here too.\"\nThe Pauls were the only factor that he hadn’t taken into account. How would he have known that they’d come back at such a good time!?\nBecause they had intervened after chaos had reigned over the battlefield for some time, they were able to participate without any casualties. Honestly, one could call that a miracle.\n\"Good work all of you. I see new faces joining us.\"\nLee Shin Woo smiled broadly and faced them. He’d been thinking about how he’d dispose of the relatively useless level 3 bones strewn across the battlefield anyway.\n[It’s been a long time, Paul Zero. I’m surprised you took these guys as your subordinates, but seeing you do all this, it makes sense somewhat.]\n[Captain, you’re really amazing!]\n\"Enough with the flattery. You all, scatter and collect all the loot and bones. I have something I can do for you as well.\"\n[Perhaps...? It’s an honor, Captain!]\n[We have bones we gathered from our own hunting, so please look after us!]\n\"Alright. I’ll let you inherit the wills within those bones. Now get a move on.\"\nJin’s goblin fire swayed, seeing Lee Shin Woo use the Pauls whenever he wished, but Lee Shin Woo completely ignored him. The Pauls moved enthusiastically, and it wasn’t long before they cleaned up the battlefield of all the loot.\n[Captain, we’re back!]\n[Here’s the Perium. This is all your karma, so please don’t hesitate and take it!]\n\"Alright. Then I’ll take it. Good work all of you...\"\n[You have acquired 17,291,080 Perium.]\n\"...\"\nLee Shin Woo accepted the Perium the Pauls had brought him all at once and couldn’t believe his eyes. It wasn’t 170,000 or 1.7 million, but 17 million? He’d only received 2 million Perium from cleaning out the entire city!\nWhat’s worse, Lee Shin Woo had separated the loot from the level 5 Elder Knights that Kratia had killed with her Grand Ice Spear, yet this was how high the total was!\n\"It wasn’t calculated wrong, was it...?\"\n\"It doesn’t seem like it?\"\nHowever, when he thought about it calmly, this seemed only natural. The undead in the city had been level 2, and the undead in the corps were level 3.\nNo matter how little a level 3 undead drops, they would drop at least 1,000 Perium; 10,000 of those would drop 10 million Perium. And if he added the level 4 and level 5 undead to that, it seemed only natural that he’d accumulate this much.\n\"Ha, haha... I think I could buy a level 7 elite bone with this much...\"\n\"I knew you’d say something like that.\"\nLee Shin Woo suddenly realized how impressive it was that he’d crushed the undead corps. However, the truly impressive part was starting now.\n[Captain, we’ll leave the weapons over here!]\n[We’ll divide the bones based on level and place them over here, Captain!]\nMost of the undead corps carried weapons. There were several exceptional weapons that were at least level 2. There were a few level 3 weapons that were good enough that Lee Shin Woo wanted them.\nHowever, the bones were more exceptional than the weapons! There were too many level 3 bones, so he couldn’t count them all, while there were around 400 level 4 bones, and 78 level 5 bones.\n’Was there only one level 6 bone; the one from the Corps Commander that I’ve already absorbed...? At the beginning, I thought there would be dozens of level 6 Corps Commanders, and even some level 7 undead as well, since it’s under the direct command of the 12 generals.’\nLee Shin Woo looked upon the separately divided heaps of bones and suddenly had that doubt.\nArema Steelworker, who was one of the 12 generals, was level 8, and his subordinate, Guillotine, was level 7. But Metafel’s Corps Commander was only level 6, even though Metafel was one of the 12 generals? They were both generals but there’s a huge difference in the strength of their forces.\n\"Even so, is it because they’re mercenaries? Or did this corps only consist of the leftover troops... If not that either, then maybe the golems are a special case and are especially powerful.\"\n\"You’re seriously saying something completely different from what you were talking about a second ago.\"\n\"If not, then perhaps the Corps Commander might’ve been powerful for a level 6...\"\nThat was probably it. Lee Shin Woo had reinforced the Drake Horn Lance significantly through Rule of Bone, assimilated with Jin, and used Shadow Sprint; through all of that, he drew out his maximum power, charged, and lunged at the Ghoul Wizard. Even though the ambush was perfect in so many ways, the Ghoul Wizard was able to cancel out his attack.\nThat was proof of the considerable stat differential between them. If Lee Shin Woo hadn’t launched the Drake Horn Lance immediately through Rule of Bone, he probably would’ve died right there. When he thought back, it was dizzying moment.\n\"If I had been able to use Avenger, the fight would’ve been a lot easier.\"\n\"But we got him, didn’t we?\"\n\"It wasn’t perfect, though. I thought this before, but the stat differential was too severe.\"\nBecause he’d advanced in various ways from this battle, he came close to a total of 2,000 stats, but 2,000 stats was still very low for a level 5. He felt as though increasing his stats by just 10 counted as growth, but if he were up against an opponent with stats higher than his by 2,000, 3,000 or even more...\nWhen he thought about the fact that he needed 3,200 stats at least to reach level 6, it wouldn’t be surprising for his enemy to possess stats doubling or even tripling his own. Moreover, there’s a disparity between the effectiveness of their status as well!\n\"Besides, we even ambushed him, a magician who possesses a frail body, without giving him the opportunity to cast any magic, yet it wasn’t perfect. I had too much faith in Rule of Bone and Bursting Thunder. I should really try harder from now on...\"\n\"Yeah, let’s play it safe from now on. Please.\"\n\"But all we need to do is not fight them face-to-face, so don’t worry so much.\"\n\"That just makes me worry more.\"\nLee Shin Woo listened to Jin, grinned, and raised his head. The Pauls, who stood side by side in a line, gazed at him with bright eyes. He was already well aware of what they wanted.\n\"Then, shall we begin? Step forward, those who wish to inherit the wills of the Empire’s soldiers and knights!\"\n[We heard from Paul 47... I would like to inherit their wills and dreams as well!]\n\"Good. You seem determined. Then we’ll start with you, Paul 39.\"\n[Yes!]\nHonestly, the level 3 bones didn’t really have any value to Lee Shin Woo or Jin. However, it was different for the Pauls. The level 3 bones would reinforce the Pauls, and even the level 4 Pauls could increase their stats by absorbing several level 3 bones.\nLee Shin Woo intended to turn all forty three of the Pauls here into level 4s, so he decided to focus Bone Reinforcement on the Pauls who hadn’t reached level 4 yet.\n[Ahhhhhh! So that’s how it was! I’m being filled with their wills, their strength, and their memories! It’s overflowing!]\n[Thank you, Paul Zero... No, Captain!]\nHis Bone Reinforcement was at a level where he could continuously reinforce the other Pauls with dozens of bones in only 1 second. Light radiated in various places, and Lee Shin Woo managed to awaken the Pauls!\n[I’ll follow you, Captain!]\n[I’m the last one, Captain!]\n\"Ah, so you were doing that again.\"\nAround that time, Kratia had finished her meditation and came down from the wall. All she’d done in the battle was manifest and throw a Grand Ice Spear, but it had a huge effect on the battlefield, so she received a lot of rewards from her achievement following the battle.\nShe was busy with her magic, so it had taken quite a bit of time for her to get down and accept all of her rewards.\n\"Kratia, just stay put and watch. Ah, and that’s your share of the loot. I’ll buy the level 5 knight bones. You’ll sell them cheap, right?\"\n\"Then that’ll clear my debt of gratitude to you, as you let me stay with you longer.\"\n\"Ok.\" ᴛhis chapter is ᴜpdated by Novᴇl_Fire(.)net\nLee Shin Soo smoothly finished the deal with Kratia and went back to reinforcing.\nThe level 3 Pauls, who originally had high specs and were close to level 4, were quickly reborn as level 4 Doom Factors. On the other hand, the Pauls who had relatively low specs in comparison were indiscriminately reinforced until they couldn’t take the barrage of Bone Reinforcement and leveled up. Obviously, Lee Shin Woo got something out of it too.\n[The Bone Reinforcement skill has become Lv7. When you use Bone Reinforcement on someone else, the effect is increased and you can now absorb a large portion of it as well.]\nWas it because of the Pauls’ strong will to inherit their fellow comrades wills? It only took three hours before he was finished reinforcing them. He had used all of the level 3 bones, as well as the bones they had brought with them from hunting, and had managed to transform all of the forty three Pauls into level 4 elites!\nHowever, that wasn’t the end of his Bone Reinforcement. After he separated the items that seemed special or increased stats, he suddenly reinforced the remaining bone weapons with each other to create an even more powerful weapon!\n[Bone Reinforcement has failed!]\n[Failed.]\n[Succeeded.]\n[Failed.]\n[Failed.]\n[Failed.]\n[Succeeded. The Lv2 Bone Thorn Spear has evolved into the Lv3 Black Canine Tooth Spear!]\n\"Nice. I’ve never seen this shape and material before. Plus, it increases stats too. Pass.\"\n\"You’re really persistent, you know that...?\"\nThat’s how he used all the weapons he’d collected from the battlefield, and ultimately, he created 50 level 3 weapons. There had originally been about 20 guys wielding level 3 weapons, so he had 70 level 3 weapons in total. To top it off, he had the level 4 weapon, the Bifurcated Snake Spine!\n\"Then are you going to fuse those together now too to create an even better weapon?\"\n\"I’m not crazy. Why would I do something so wasteful?\"\n\"Then are you going to give them to the Pauls...?\"\n\"That’s what I’ll do if I have any left remaining.\"\nBefore, Lee Shin Woo liked absorbing bones more than bone equipment to strengthen himself. However, after he acquired the Weapon Trickster’s bone, and learned the Bone Armory skill, that thought changed a bit.\nHe thought he needed to make use of all the weapons that he could. Because of that, this was his decision.\n\"Now let’s fill up the storehouse (Bone Armory).\"\n[1] E/N: 130, he forgot the Agility increase apparently.",

    "content": "<Chapter 19. Clean Up - 1>\nBone Armory’s potential was as limitless as Rule of Bone. Even if the level of the equipment was low, he could use the information from other pieces of equipment to reinforce the low leveled ones. Like what happened to his level 3 armor, which leveled up due to the Acid Skull Helm.\n\"In other words, the diversity of the equipment is as important as the level. Since I can combine that countless information and create something that fits the situation.\"\n\"You’re an alchemist...\"\n\"As I thought, the one thing my bone skills have in common is that they’re all fraudulent skills!\"\nMost level 3 equipment had stats attached to them. Of course, absorbing bone equipment was like absorbing bones; the more bone equipment of a similar type he absorbed, the less effective it would be. However, that wasn’t the case right now. Thɪs chapter is updatᴇd by NoveI(F)ire.net\nHe watched the reborn level 4 Pauls examine themselves and decided to visit the buffet... start his own Bone Reinforcement. First up was the bone staff, the Bifurcated Snake Spine which helped him impersonate the Corps Commander.\nKratia’s eyes lit up at the sight, but Lee Shin Woo calmly ignored her. In any case, she wasn’t the one who took him down! If she asked for it as part of her share, then he was prepared to pay for it with Perium. Since he wasn’t a thief.\n\"Then... Bone Reinforcement.\"\n[Absorbing the Lv4 Bifurcated Snake Spine. Magic has increased by 40. The absorbed Bifurcated Snake Spine is affected by the other equipment in the Bone Armory and is buffed.]\nThe information of the other absorbed equipment in the Bone Armory was applied, and the absorbed information was analyzed and buffed, transforming into a completely new piece of equipment! Lee Shin Woo didn’t wait for the result and absorbed the next piece of equipment. This time, it was a level 3 helmet that completely covered his face.\n[Absorbing the level 3 Full Skull Helm. Health has increased by 7. The absorbed Full Skull Helm reinforces the Acid Skull Helm’s information. You can now summon the Acid Full Skull Helm.]\nThis time, there wasn’t any need for analysis; it immediately transformed. Since the information update only applied to a specific piece of equipment! Moreover, Lee Shin Woo was even more pleased, as it was the outcome he’d expected.\nThe options weren’t updated, but he was now able to summon a helmet that better covered his face and its defense naturally increased. Just this made it worth it to absorb the helmet.\n\"Is level 3 equipment normally this common?\"\n\"If undead corps of at least 10,000 strong are common in this world, then yeah, they’re common.\"\n\"Bone Reinforcement! Bone Reinforcement!\"\nLee Shin Woo ignored Kratia and Jin, who were watching from behind and talking nonsense, and continued to absorb the weapons.\nWhile some equipment only raised his stats by like 1 health and 1 strength, which was nothing to write home about, other equipment raised his stats by so much that it made him wonder ’is this really ok for a level 3 weapon?’, as the stat gain was shocking.\n\"Bone Reinforcement! ...Hmm, this.\"\nEspecially if there was a piece of equipment that was already stored within the Bone Armory that shared a great affinity with the absorbed equipment; in cases like that, the item would change dramatically, becoming greater than he expected. A gold mine amongst these was...\n[Absorbing the Lv3 Spine Whip. Strength and Agility have increased by 7. The absorbed Spine Whip is affected by the other equipment in the Bone Armory and is buffed. You can now summon the Lv5 Bifurcated Spine Whip.]\n\"To think the information of level 3 equipment and level 4 equipment could combine to make a level 5 weapon...\"\n\"You’re really rubbing salt in the wound. Since I can’t even equip armor, I’m not jealous one bit.\"\n\"Show me! Show me the level 5 equipment!\"\nWhile Jin seemed uninterested, Kratia’s eyes brightened like a little kid. Rather than the effect of the item, she was likely interested in how the two’s information mingled together to create a new piece of equipment.\n\"Fine. Then...\"\n\"Oooh...!\"\nLee Shin Woo summoned the Bifurcated Spine Whip for Kratia.\nThe level 3 Spine Whip possessed a flat grip, and above it, was a 2 meter long, unpleasant human shaped spine. On the other hand, the level 5 Bifurcated Spine Whip had a different grip feel, and the menacing spine split into two, stretching up to three meters with thorns protruding from it; the overall feel was completely different.\n\"As I thought, a level 5 weapon looks a lot different.\"\n\"I-It’s really pretty...\"\n’Perhaps Kratia’s feeling really disappointed right now...’ Kratia’s eyes brightened even more when she looked upon the Bifurcated Spine Whip, causing Lee Shin Woo to inwardly mutter.\n[You have 2 level 5 weapons stored inside of the Bone Armory. The Bone Armory skill has become Lv4. Health and Magic have increased by 10. The number of equipment you can summon and maintain at one time has increased to 4.]\n\"Yes!\"\nBone Armory had leveled up, so he could finally summon upper and lower body armor, a helmet, and a weapon as well! He’d suffered for quite a long time since first attaining the Bone Armory skill, but now he finally recovered his fully armed state!\nHowever, this wasn’t the end of his happiness. He had alternated between absorbing weapons and armor, and while the pieces of equipment’s information he’d lacked was slowly being filled, he apparently fulfilled some sort of condition he wasn’t aware of and this message appeared:\n[You have completed the Lv4 Acid Bone Full Armor. You can summon the pieces separately, or you can summon it as a single, complete set.]\n\"Wait, does this mean...\"\nThe moment that message appeared, Lee Shin Woo de-equipped all his equipment, even while he was in disbelief. Jin was shocked and whether or not he yelled wasn’t his concern; he immediately summoned the armor again. Seeing that, Jin tilted his head and spoke.\n\"Huh? Maybe it’s because the equipment information was updated, but it feels like the armor has a greater sense of unity than before.\"\n\"Your high agility makes you quite sharp. You’re right. This has been unified.\"\nThe Acid Bone Full Armor was one set. In other words, the three pieces: the helm, the upper body armor, and the lower body armor, were considered one piece and could be summoned as a whole! Naturally, the mana consumption was reduced, and the armor’s joints became tougher. To think he would achieve a unification here, when he couldn’t do so in his own homeland...!\nLee Shin Woo was deeply moved and examined his body. He’d absorbed dozens of equipment and because the strong points of the armor and weapons were applied, his armor was both refined and functional.\nAbove all, there weren’t any chinks in the armor and it covered his entire body. From an outsider’s perspective, one wouldn’t be able to tell whether he was living or undead!\n’I can mimic a living person’s mana, so if I’m in a jam, I’ll act while wearing the armor, and when I take it off, I’ll disguise myself. It’s perfect...!’\nOf course, if the situation necessitated it and he needed to play a different role, he would need to change the appearance of his armor a bit, but because he’d absorbed so much equipment, he wasn’t worried about changing his armor.\n\"Nice. As I thought, it was an excellent decision.\"\nAfter that, Lee Shin Woo, who had become more flexible, absorbed a few more pieces of equipment. Around the time no more meaningful changes occurred, he stopped his outstretched hand.\nSeeing Kratia’s eyes brighten up, Lee Shin Woo firmly shook his head and explained.\n\"Since they were similar types of soldiers, the weapons they use don’t have much variety to them. I think this is enough. Any more is meaningless.\"\nHe’d absorbed around forty pieces of equipment, and obtained at least 200 stats. That meant his stats increased by 160 if he excluded the 40 magic he’d gained from the Bifurcated Snake Spine. In many ways, the suddenly appearing undead corps had helped Lee Shin Woo. It was to the point that Lee Shin Woo wanted to kowtow before one of the 12 generals, the Mercenary King Metafel.\n\"Then what about what’s left...?\"\n\"You guys. Whoever doesn’t have a level 3 weapon come over here and pick whatever you like.\"\n[Captain!]\n[Thank you, Captain!]\nLee Shin Woo was offering them the leftover weapons and acted as though he was doing this out of the generosity of his heart, but even so, the Pauls couldn’t help but be touched by his actions.\nHonestly, he was only doing this because they’d defeated a force of 10,000. Normally, level 3 equipment wasn’t easy to find. If one wanted to buy this kind of equipment from the secret shop, they would need to possess considerable funds.\n\"If it’s that expensive, why don’t you just sell it at the shop?\"\n\"I thought about that too, but the sales charge pisses me off. In terms of cost performance, giving these guys the equipment to increase their strength is probably better.\"\n\"...\"\nOriginally, Lee Shin Woo hadn’t had any consideration for the Pauls. However, as he realized that he could make them into his subordinates, as well as use Bone Reinforcement on them to transform them into level 4 elites, he began to have a small hope for them.\nIf the numbers kept increasing like this and he increased their levels, he might be able to create an independent force!\n\"The more variables there are, the better. Investing this much into them doesn’t feel like a waste.\"\n\"You... you’re really amazing.\"\n\"Lately, I’ve been thinking that a bit too.\"\nLee Shin Woo replied honestly, and went to the last thing on his agenda. Naturally, it was to reinforce himself and Jin with the level 4 and 5 bones.\n\"That wouldn’t work on me, right?\"\n\"Come back when you’re only bones.\"\n\"No thanks.\"\nIf he were to exclude Vitas, the Corps Commander, the other remaining bones didn’t really have any exceptional options. The level 4 knights’ and magicians’ memories and experiences was useful, and the stats and skill proficiency from the level 5 Elder Knights and Wizards was tremendous.\n[The Intermediate Bursting Thunder skill has become Lv2. Strength and Magic have increased by 5. You can better incorporate lighting into your weapon and, using that lightning, you may swing your weapon faster.]\n[The Intermediate Shadow Sprint skill has become Lv2. Agility has increased by 10. Your running form looks a bit more like a shadow.]\nLee Shin Woo’s total stats were now 2,272 due to the stat gain from the bones, as well as the experiences that further improved his skills. He needed 928 more stats to reach level 6.\nThough he’d obtained hundreds of stats from one battle, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t satisfied. That’s because he knew that he still had a long way to go.\n\"Uuuuuuugh.\"\n\"Don’t be so dramatic. You didn’t even absorb half of what I did.\"\n\"U-Ugh.\"\nIn order for Jin to more effectively absorb the undeads’ experiences and memories, he twitched on the floor while Lee Shin Woo calmly sorted through the experiences and memories.\nThis was his time to organize the combat and magic techniques he’d acquire from the knights and magicians; it was simultaneously a time for him to organize his information on one of the twelve generals, the Mercenary King Metafel, as well as the corps he led using the Corps Commander Vitas’ memories.\n’Their past... and if it’s possible, their present as well.’\nLee Shin Woo calmly organized the memories and at some point, he opened his eyes wide open. His waning goblin fire looked as though it had suddenly burst out.\n\"W-What’s wrong?\"\nSeeing that, Kratia was slightly scared and asked. Lee Shin Woo replied extremely calmly.\n\"It’s nothing.\"\n\"Liar.\"\n\"Yeah, I’m lying.\"\n\"...\"\nKratia pouted at Lee Shin Woo’s extremely confident attitude, while Lee Shin Woo just grinned. Then, he spoke amicably.\n\"Let’s do our best for the remainder of our contract.\"\nHe spoke as if he had drawn the line there, and he would never tell her no matter what. Realizing that, Kratia felt the urge to increase the contract duration, but unfortunately, she had no way of doing so, so she ultimately disappointedly nodded her head.",

    "content": "<Chapter 19. Clean Up - 2>\nAll beings possess a magic inherent to them, and the properties of this magic gradually change as one accumulates karma and grows. For example, if one were to train in ice magic, their magic would become colder, and if one used magic to reinforce their sword and body, their magic would become heavier.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo’s magic was a bit different. Since he had such a variety of abilities, and had used these abilities so diligently, his magic didn’t have a chance to go in a specific direction. No, that’s what he had thought in the beginning, but that wasn’t actually the case. His magic was...\n\"That means the innate quality of my magic can change case-by-case!?\"\n\"Yeah sure, why not?\"\nKratia couldn’t understand how Lee Shin Woo’s magic could so freely change, and made her hair even messier than before, but Lee Shin Woo just shrugged his shoulders.\nIn the process of creating a golem’s mana, he had a small realization: his mana had become a part of him, and was something he could fabricate like his speech, his expression, or his clothes. He could say that even his mana had become an extension of the Acting and Disguise skills.\n\"If I attempted to do it consciously, the magic loss would be too severe. But you... can control it freely. Yeah, that’s the characteristic of your mana. The quality of having an indeterminate form that can change into anything!\"\n\"In other words, my magic is like Xitto... [1]\"\nConsidering the fact that Lee Shin Woo could control three of the elements themselves, Lee Shin Woo’s magic already possessed limitless potential.\nKratia recognized that she couldn’t do what Lee Shin Woo could do before, yet even so, she couldn’t stop her research. What she said next was something that would be helpful to Lee Shin Woo as well.\n\"My Catalyst Magic was an attempt to replicate your ability to change mana. Since it’s hard for me to change my own mana, I decided to change the naturally existing mana instead.\"\n\"That sounds even harder!\"\n\"No, it’s not hard. Because a lot of techniques already exist that induce the naturally occurring mana to change. But in the process of analyzing your mana, I was able to create a new mana pattern that has better mana cohesion and efficiency.\"\n\"Mm, I understand it all, so keep going.\"\nLee Shin Woo decided to memorize everything Kratia was saying and insisted that she continue. She sighed and continued.\n\"If the focus of your ability is to change your own mana, then mine is to change external mana. And my way of barely doing so is through a ’catalyst’. So what I’m saying is...\"\nShe paused and raised a small orb. It was the growing artifact she got from God, the Orb of Eternal Ice. As expected, that everlasting ice crystal was the catalyst of her magic.\n\"I was narrowly able to induce the magic to change. It hasn’t been long since this child was born, so its course hasn’t completely been set yet, so... in a lot of ways, I was lucky. Since it’s now easy to impart a will upon an item.\"\n\"So are you trying to brag about your artifact to me or what?\"\n\"More importantly, don’t you feel something from looking at this orb...?\"\n\"It’s big and beautiful.\"\n\"Liar.\"\nLee Shin Woo gazed at the orb piercingly, the orb being daintier than Kratia’s white hand. Kratia pushed the orb forward, as if she were ok with him holding it and gazing at it, but Lee Shin Woo shook his head.\n\"If I touch it, it might change into bone.\"\n\"What a terrifying ability.\"\nLee Shin Woo examined the orb more carefully than before. He felt a vortex of ice cold mana within that was expanding even now.\nHe’d used ice mana a bit before through the elemental reversal ability. He expected that he’d be able to completely master that element as well, if he practiced just a bit more with the Bifurcated Snake Spine.\n’But that’s not the issue right now.’\nThe pattern that caused the mana to remain inside the orb was extremely unique. That was probably why Kratia had told him to take a look.\nLooking at it once wouldn’t be enough for him to memorize the pattern; it wasn’t that easy. This whole thing was a magic circle! If the difficulty of creating a golem’s seal was increased by 100x, then this is what it would look like.\n\"Ultimately, this technique just allows me, who’s proficient in ice magic, to use the ice artifact, Eternal Ice, to change the surrounding mana into ice, but... you should be able to learn something from this.\"\n\"Yeah... Alright. I completely understand it.\"\nLike always, Lee Shin Woo maintained his poker face and spoke calmly, but Kratia knew that Lee Shin Woo had no idea how it worked.\n\"...Should we increase the duration of the contract?\"\n\"No. If all I need to do is memorize it, I can do it within a day.\"\n\"Tch.\"\nThe moment her plan to continue accompanying Lee Shin Woo and acquire some magic inspiration from him failed... That’s right. This was the last day of their contract. Starting tomorrow, hey had to go their own separate ways.\nKratia inwardly spewed out curses at Lee Shin Woo, as he failed to acknowledge her passion for magic, but outwardly, she endured with a slight pout. Being angry would be a waste of precious time.\n\"In any case, I’ll continue explaining. I was barely able to manifest the magic through a catalyst, but you’re capable to transforming your mana into anything. Right?\"\n\"I can’t transform it into anything. Just what I know.\"\n\"In other words, if you figure out how this ’catalyst’ works, you should be able to turn your body itself into a huge catalyst. At least, that’s what I’ve been thinking.\"\nTime froze at that very moment. As expected of a woman who handles ice magic; her skills were peerless.\n\"You know, you’re saying something really frightening right now.\"\n\"It’s not that frightening compared to your latent potential.\"\nLee Shin Woo dwelled over what Kratia had said so nonchalantly, and his body slightly quivered. ’I can become a catalyst, huh...’ If that happened, he’d be able to control the mana in the entire area however he pleased.\nEspecially because Lee Shin Woo could freely change his mana. If he could actually change his mana into a catalyst, the products that came about from it would be limitless.\n\"I can’t even imagine it.\"\n\"It’ll be possible for you someday. As long as I help you.\"\n\"Why are you going so far to help me?\"\n\"Since I want to see it happen.\" ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ novèlfire.net\nKratia replied unhesitatingly, her eyes surging with a delicate enthusiasm. It might’ve been unbecoming for an Ice Magician, but Lee Shin Woo thought that this pure passion of hers may have been the driving force behind her growth to level 6.\n\"Even so, I’m not extending the duration of the contract.\"\n\"Why not!?\"\nKratia yelled, genuinely frustrated, and Lee Shin Woo just grinned and replied.\n\"What’s wrong with you? It’s not like we’re never going to see each other again. We can just form another team when we meet again. I’ll probably be stronger than you by then.\"\n\"You seem plenty strong now...\"\n\"I’m not interested in strength that can only be used in a self-contained situation.\"\nIf he didn’t have the strength to overcome an enemy face-to-face, he would ultimately have to rely on unconventional tactics each and every time. Lee Shin Woo was confident in his unconventional tactics, but he also believed that he couldn’t rely on such shallow methods forever.\n’Rule of Bone, Bursting Thunder, Mana Bone... I can become strong. As long as I strive for it.’\nLee Shin Woo forcefully balled his hands into fists and suddenly resolved himself. He didn’t show what he was feeling very often, but before he knew it, he’d begun to trust Kratia more and had done so unconsciously.\nSeeing that, Kratia felt that they fundamentally weren’t very different and was very slightly relieved. Meanwhile, Jin had been ignoring everything else and was training his Steel Body.\n[The Intermediate Mana Bone skill has become Lv4. Magic has increased by 10. Any action concerning the use of mana is buffed.]\nBefore it became dark, Lee Shin Woo successfully memorized the Eternal Ice’s structure, and that was enough to cause his Mana Bone skill to level up. That meant the knowledge she’d passed on to him was something extraordinary.\nKratia also gained something from this. Lee Shin Woo lent her his Bifurcated Snake Spine, and demonstrated how he changed the elements; that deepened her understanding of her own element and naturally caused her Catalyst Magic to develop further as well.\nIf she were still on her home planet, the two of them wouldn’t be able to separate, as they had shared so much of their information and experiences with each other. They would be together until death.\n\"It’s unfortunate that we can’t.\"\n\"Haha, you’re funny Mr. Feynman [2], but you can’t do that here.\"\n\"I’ll contact you when I can private chat.\"\n\"Alright. About what I requested. You can do it, right?\"\n\"Of course.\"\nKratia firmly nodded her head, holding the Limited Order Bone Core that Lee Shin Woo had remodeled.\nShe wasn’t finished studying the core, but it was still Lee Shin Woo’s, so she was about to tearfully return it to him. However, Lee Shin Woo said it was fine if she kept it and instead asked her to fulfill a request of his.\n’If you find any golems on the way, don’t destroy them. Instead, command them to go to a specific place.’\nOriginally, others couldn’t command golems with the core aside from Lee Shin Woo, unless they were temporary commands. Lee Shin Woo had drastically increased the functions of the core, and in the end, succeeded in infusing the core with the Steelworker command authority.\nHis goal was to maintain an army of golems! If he were able to gather golems, they would become a reliable fighting force later on. Of course, Lee Shin Woo also planned on giving any golem he encountered the same command.\n\"Ah, thanks for the grapes. I feel like I could just eat grapes until I die.\"\n\"Make sure you get enough nutrients.\"\nThe two extended their arms and shook hands. A warm heat transmitted to his bare bone hand. It felt like his completely empty heart was being warmed as well.\nIt felt qualitatively different from when he had shook hands with Erian; for a moment, Lee Shin Woo felt a bit regretful as he might’ve been able to form a relationship like this with Erian as well, but... Lee Shin Woo soon erased that thought from his mind.\n’Since it was my choice.’\nHe didn’t just have to part ways with Kratia. Lee Shin Woo had to part ways with the forty three Pauls, who were reborn as level 4 elites.\n[We are truly... in your debt, Captain. I’d like to always serve by your side, but...]\n\"It’s not yet time. I told you last time, but I still have a lot I need to do.\"\n[Captain...]\n\"However, I promise you. There will be a time when we fight together. There’ll be a day when the curse is lifted from the Underground Empire.\"\n[We’ll do our utmost to prepare for that day! We won’t trouble you, Captain!]\nOriginally, they trusted and obeyed Lee Shin Woo because of his connections to both Anti-Skull and General Seagald.\nHowever, once they became his subordinates, they didn’t really think about General Seagald. He was just someone they once pledged their loyalty to; their lives already belonged to Lee Shin Woo!\n\"I’ll give you the golems. I’ll save those who are wandering through the darkness like you and send them to you.\"\n[I understand, Captain!]\nIf his final goodbye with Kratia felt like a story of youth, then his final goodbye with the Pauls felt like a war story. Kratia, who hadn’t left yet, saw that and was deeply touched; that was the icing on the cake.\n[We’ll return no matter what, Captain! No matter what!]\n\"See you later. Don’t die.\"\n\"Yeah, don’t die.\"\nThe Pauls, accompanied by the three Iron Golems which had reduced their size, and Kratia, who wielded the orb and core in each hand, went in separate directions. Lee Shin Woo sent them off with a smile.\n\"They’re completely gone now, right?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nAnd when they couldn’t see them anymore, Lee Shin Woo secretly lowered his hand. He wasn’t even doing something that made him feel small, but pointlessly felt as though he couldn’t hold his head up high.\n\"...Good. Then, shall we go?\"\n\"Go by yourself.\"\n\"You have nothing to be afraid of...\"\nLee Shin Woo smiled bitterly at Jin’s firm reply... he now had four permits to God’s secret shop due to the battle; he used one of them and entered God’s secret shop.\n[1] T/N: Pokemon reference.\n[2] T/N: May be referring to Richard Feynman, but I’m not really sure.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 19 part3",
    "content": "<Chapter 19. Clean Up - 3>\n\"Guten abend! [1]...Oh my, you came by yourself?\"\n\"Hello, Pleine.\"\nThe secret shop’s owner, Pleine, always greeted him with the same expression, whether it was when he was level 1 and didn’t know anything, or now, when he was level 5 and realized that the events in the Underground Empire aren’t progressing as simply as a retro game’s scenario.\n\"Is the hot cocoa good?\"\n\"Would you like some? Ah, I forgot you can’t drink it.\"\nMoreover, she would always be eating something with a blissful expression whenever he entered the shop; she never failed to get under his skin! The red haired beauty set down her cup of hot cocoa, which had been pressed to her lips, and laughed while Lee Shin Woo just grit his teeth.\nThen, she spoke a bit more seriously than before.\n\"Last time I said I didn’t think you’d be able to gather all that Perium, but how about it? Did you gather 1.3 million Perium?\"\n\"Of course I did.\"\nWas it time to fight back now? Lee Shin Woo smiled faintly and Pleine was sure that he made a lot of money.\n\"The time between visits was a bit long this time...\"\n\"Ah, that’s because I went to God’s garden in between, so I needed some time to gather some more permits.\"\n\"You visited God!?\"\nAs expected, it seemed as though Pleine’s information was indeed limited. Upon saying that he went to God’s garden, Pleine started bombarding him with questions, and Lee Shin Woo just replied adequately. When he told her about how he’d asked God for a quest to kill the undead heroes, she laughed uproariously.\n\"You made a choice like a hero who’s been underground for dozens of years!\"\n\"I’m not actually sure if this was a good idea or not, but...\"\n\"You’re probably already aware of this, but there’s a limit to the karma she can bestow upon a human. A piece of her grace, the God’s garden which can only be reached by gathering permits is also the same. That’s the reason she cannot give you such a tremendous blessing, no matter how much she might want to.\"\nIf God could unlimitedly bestow her power to others, the curse would already be gone. The reason Lee Shin Woo could receive a greater blessing than the other heroes was because he traded his life for it. At the time, he couldn’t understand, but now he understood it well, as if it were only natural.\n\"That’s true.\"\n\"What if she doesn’t personally bestow that grace, but does so indirectly; and what if that blessing can only be bestowed upon you by using your own karma as a foundation? Naturally, the limitation widens significantly. That’s the reason you were able to obtain the information regarding the scattered undead heroes in the Empire.\"\nLee Shin Woo had made that request because he had a rough idea of what would happen. He thought it’d be much more profitable to get the quest rather than an item, but... In terms of results, he’d hit the mark. It was fine if he accepted it like that.\n\"Pleine, do you know about Ethan Cruz?\"\n\"Ah... if you’re asking specifically about him, does that mean you know?\"\nLee Shin Woo wordlessly nodded his head and Pleine looked like she was at a loss.\n\"You’ve realized something that the other heroes have yet to realize. But regarding that person... I can only tell you to avoid him. I don’t trade with him because I like him. Please understand that I can’t carelessly pass on his information so long as he remains a hero.\"\n\"Is it really ok for a hero to kill another hero?\"\n\"It’s not really forbidden. Normally, heroes can’t absorb other heroes’ strength by killing them, and even if they gain karma from killing them, they’ll also accumulate bad karma, so there’s no reason to do something so foolish...\"\nEthan Cruz must possess an authority that makes that bad karma beneficial to him, or maybe he has a skill that does it. That’s probably enough information. Pleine looked really troubled, so Lee Shin Woo just shrugged his shoulders and decided to go on to the main topic.\n\"Anyway, I have some goods that I’d like to sell this time around.\"\n\"Goods you’d like to sell? Ah, is it food?\"\nPleine knew that Lee Shin Woo possessed an ability that allowed him to utilize most items, so she quickly came to a conclusion, and sported a deep smile.\n\"You must’ve acquired it in a dungeon, so it should be fruit or vegetables. No, is it meat? Both are fine. Because every other hero wants food, you’ll be paid handsomely.\"\n\"How about alcohol?\"\n\"Alcohol?\"\nPleine’s eyes momentarily shimmered, like the stars on the ceiling of a planetarium. At least, that’s what it felt like to him.\n\"Alcohol is sold at an expensive price above ground as well! The unit price is different, the unit price! Please take it out. How many bottles do you have!?\"\n\"You sell goods above ground as well?\"\n\"Oh my. I have to make a living too, so I can’t just trade with heroes, who only bring gloomy things, right? You haven’t taken the alcohol out yet? What type is it? Whiskey? Rice Wine? Vodka? Ah, but wine would be the best.\"\nWas it the mood? It felt like Pleine would drink the alcohol whenever he took out a bottle... Lee Shin Woo slightly opened his inventory and took out a bottle of wine. Pleine’s eyes definitely shimmered like stars this time.\n\"It’s wine!\"\n\"Please take a look.\"\n\"This is from Kerr Century!? There was still a Kerr Century remaining underground?\"\n\"Ah, yes...\"\nIf he told her there was an entire winery still there, it felt like she would take everything he had. Around now, Lee Shin Woo realized that the goods he’d brought weren’t ordinary.\n\"Ah, they’re not vintage. But this much wine... Mm, alright. It has a premium, so I can give you 20,000 Perium for it.\"\n\"That’s not all I have. I have other types, so please take a look at them.\"\n\"Others!? 381... This is a great vintage! This is vintage as well! This isn’t... Ah, but it’s still great wine. Since only novices are so concerned over the vintage.\"\n\"I have no idea what you’re talking about, so do as you please.\"\nBefore he entered the secret shop, it felt like he was going to a wholesale dealer to sell his wine, but now it felt like he was having a sommelier examine his wine.\nLee Shin Woo took out all the wine he had, which was a bit less than 50 bottles, and she looked distressed, with the most serious expression he’d ever seen from her... then, she opened her mouth.\n\"I’ll buy them all for a total of 1.5 million Perium.\"\n\"...That’s quite a lot.\"\n\"They’re that valuable. Wine requires countless people’s effort and finances to create, so the karmic value is considerable. That’s especially true for older wine. Finally, there’s a saying that Kerr Century’s wine is so delicious that ’you have to bow before drinking it, even though it’s the cheapest’.\"\n\"I see... Then I’ll sell them at that price.\"\n\"Wait a sec.\"\nLee Shin Woo spoke nonchalantly, and Pleine’s eyes glittered. her red hair surged up, as if it were aflame.\n\"Them? Do you have others as well?\"\n\"Yes, I have the biggest one left.\"\n\"The biggest one!?\"\nThis time, Pleine’s hands wriggled unpleasantly. She showed him so many expressions that he’d never seen from her before with just one word, ’alcohol’, and obediently took out the alcohol like she wanted. Well, one barrel for now.\n\"What is... Huh?\"\nPleine looked vacantly at him as if saying ’you said you’d bring out alcohol, but what’s with this wooden barrel?’, but soon realized what it was.\n\"I thought you’d brought way too much, but... you didn’t.\"\n\"I took everything that was in a winery. I have others besides this one.\"\n\"Kyaa!\"\nUntil now, Pleine had only moved her hands from behind the stall and hadn’t even bobbed her head up and down, yet for the first time, she abruptly stood up from her seat. Lee Shin Woo watched her and his goblin fire gently swayed.\n\"Are you planning to drink it all yourself?\" Thɪs chapter is updated by NoveIꜰire.net\n\"I-I can’t do that. I can’t... Though it would be easy...\"\nEven while speaking, she instinctually extended her hand towards him. Since he knew what she wanted, Lee Shin Woo helped her touch the wooden barrel and the next moment her hand slightly shook. She had read the information on the wooden barrel.\n\"Kerr Century... 395...\"\n\"...\"\nPleine, who’d ascertained when the wine was made, gently closed her eyes. Her throat slightly wriggled. The sight of her trying to restrain her surging emotions actually shocked Lee Shin Woo.\nHe could understand why she felt so conflicted without even asking her. She didn’t look it, but she was someone connected with the fall of the Underground Empire.\n\"I suppose... even then... they were still fermenting alcohol...\"\nPleine, who had struggled to open her eyes, strained herself to say that. He acted like he hadn’t heard her. However, she continued.\n\"Well, I suppose that’s what happened. That’s when everything was overflowing with life. They had never failed with magic before. The harvest was bountiful...\"\n\"...Can I call you granny?\"\n\"Customer, do you want me to hit you? Do you? Do you want to get hit?\"\nHe teased her in an attempt to cheer her up, but he ended up pissing her off. However, it wasn’t like it was completely ineffective as she soon left her sentimental thoughts behind; she fake coughed with an ’ahem’ and returned to her normal calm voice.\n\"Mr. Lee Shin Woo, please act as if you didn’t hear what I just said. Ah, and please remember that I’m seventeen.\"\n\"Yes, I understand.\"\nGetting involved with a merchant who calls herself seventeen when she’s not can’t lead to anything good... Lee Shin Woo suddenly felt relieved that he was a skeleton, and Pleine made an offer.\n\"The wine’s own value, as well as its historical value... That’s excluding the rating as well. This alcohol is way too valuable to exchange for Perium, so let’s trade instead. I’ll trade for them with whatever you wish for, Mr. Lee Shin Woo.\"\n\"That’s good. I want bones.\"\n\"I knew you would say that.\"\nDespite the fact that the barrels had significantly lower value as they weren’t bottled, each barrel stored several dozens of liters of wine, so each wooden barrel was valued at at least 1 million Perium. He’d cleared out an entire winery, so he would be able to easily buy a level 6 elite bone.\n\"Then I’ll take them out.\"\n\"How many do you have? I’d like to get a rough estimate, so I can give you suitable products in exchange...\"\nPleine, who sported a joyous expression and had been rummaging under the counter, saw Lee Shin Woo take barrel after barrel out of his inventory, and her face gradually stiffened.\n\"Wait a sec. How many barrels do you have!?\"\n\"I think there were about 100 barrels... I counted about 2,000 liters.\"\n\"2,000 liters. Then that means... Eek!\"\nShe didn’t think just one hero would be able to sell so much that she would go ’eek’! Pleine just let that moment pass. Lee Shin Woo was flustered, and Pleine quickly straightened herself out, stood up... and made an offer.\n\"Mr. Lee Shin Woo... There’s an item that was stored many years ago in this shop and none like it have ever entered the shop again. Would you like to see it?\"\n\"I told you I wanted some bones.\"\n\"Yes, it’s a bone. It’s also the best bone we have.\"\n’Could it be?’ Lee Shin Woo thought, and the moment his eyes lit up... Pleine nodded her head as if his assumption was correct and spoke.\n\"It’s the only bone in this shop that costs 30 million... It’s the level 7 elite, the Giant Fenno’s bone.\"\n[1] T/N: German for good evening.",

    "content": "<Chapter 19. Clean Up - 4>\n\"It took quite a long time.\"\nWhile Lee Shin Woo was visiting the shop, Kehebe remained quiet. Jin must’ve been really bored being stuck in the city alone as he welcomed him back. Lee Shin Woo grinned and replied.\n\"That’s because we were setting the price of each and every barrel of wine.\"\n\"So? How was it?\"\nJin asked whether the wine was sold at a high price or not, and Lee Shin Woo simply replied like this.\n\"I took all of the level 6 elite bones they had. It seems like there aren’t a lot of people killing level 6 elites.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Yet there’s still a barrel of wine leftover.\"\n\"Why didn’t you just sell it and buy a weapon or something?\"\nThe only thing Lee Shin Woo didn’t sell was the first wooden barrel he’d discovered in the winery containing the Kerr Century Dellocus 395 (52 L). While he could obtain all the bones without selling it, there was another important reason to it.\n\"I’ll probably use it later somewhere.\"\n\"It doesn’t seem like we’d have a use for it, but... No, do what you want.\"\nHe was probably being considerate, but it didn’t really work. Lee Shin Woo chuckled and changed the subject.\n\"Then shall we start reinforcing?\"\n\"Oh no. Don’t.\"\nLee Shin Woo possessed 120 million Perium in total; this came from selling all the wine that he’d gotten from the winery, as well as from the battle that ensued with the corps. With that 120 million Perium, he’d brought something that cost as much as 30 million! That was a level 7 elite, Fenno’s bone.\nAnd with the remaining 90 million he bought all of the level 6 elite bones, which ranged from 1.5 million Perium to 7 million. As a result, there were 24 bones on the ground emitting light; 23 level 6 bones, and one level 7 bone.\n\"Life is all about luck.\"\n\"It’s scary just looking at it all...\"\nWhat they’d acquired from selling all of the wine trumped everything that Lee Shin Woo and Jin had acquired thus far through their blood, sweat, and tears!\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo knew that life was like that. What was most important in life? It was luck. Lee Shin Woo was just happy that luck was on his side right now.\n\"Right now, the most important stat for you is magic. So let’s put all the bones that increase magic in your direction.\"\n\"Level 6 bones... The level 5 bones hurt like crazy, so do you really think that I can absorb the level 6s?\"\n\"I’ll help you. You should be able to endure it.\"\n\"Ugh...\"\nIn the end, Jin resolved himself. He couldn’t back off for his own sake, and he couldn’t back off for Lee Shin Woo’s sake as well, since he wanted to be more helpful to Lee Shin Woo.\nLee Shin Woo realized that Jin was all ready, so he raised one level 6 bone in his hand. It was a bone which was radiating an extremely deep blue; it was quite obvious that in terms of pure magic, the original owner of this bone was greater than Vitas, who led a corps of 10,000 strong.\n\"We’re connected, so it shouldn’t be that hard.\"\n\"Hoo... I got it. Let’s go.\"\n\"...Alright.\"\nAs the level of his Bone Reinforcement increased, he was able to share almost all the memories within the bone when used on another person, so it was certainly an important moment for Lee Shin Woo as well.\nHe softly placed the bone atop Jin’s head, who was gently closing his eyes and concentrating, and activated Bone Reinforcement. At that moment the magic knowledge and the immense magic within flooded Jin’s mind and instantly filled it to the brim.\n[Executing Bone Reinforcement on Jin Taylor by consuming the Lv6 Skeleton High Wizard, Punetra’s skull.]\n\"Urgh...!\"\n\"No, you can take this much. It’ll end soon.\"\n\"What about you!? Ugh!\"\nLee Shin Woo calmly bore with the countless, confusing memories and organized them one by one. He accepted the information that wouldn’t be helpful to Jin, and helped him to absorb the knowledge that would help him to utilize mana.\nIf it weren’t for his joint research with Kratia, this would’ve been difficult for him as well, but now that wasn’t so. He hadn’t become a magician; he’d just become very familiar with the method in which they accumulate their knowledge and skills!\n[The Empire’s magic is too outdated.]\n[Why didn’t my teacher tell me his plans and leave on his own?]\n[A Royal Magician? They’re just worms without a speck of talent.]\nThere were some fragmented memories that came along with the experiences that he judged to be ineffectual and unimportant; he was absolutely sure that the original owner of this bone possessed a sharp temper and was quite arrogant. Big talk for someone who’d died when he was only level 6.\nHowever, there would be a place where he could use these magic patterns, so he at least decided to memorize all of them. Since a Joker could absorb one thing, mix it together with something else, and create three or four new things!\n[Jin Taylor is reinforced through Bone Reinforcement. A significant amount of memories and experiences are divided and shared. Magic has increased by 3. Low Rank Fire has become Lv7.]\nBone Reinforcement was successful. Because the bone’s original owner used fire magic, Lee Shin Woo’s fire element had leveled up.\nIt was the first element he’d acquired, and humiliatingly, it was also the lowest level of his elements, but if he leveled it up just a few more times, it would be at the intermediate rank, and would exhibit a similar level of power as acid or lightning!\n\"How about you? It seemed like he was a magician who specialized in Fire Rain, so did you get a skill similar to that?\"\n\"Nope. I’m sad. I’d rather be the falling rain.\"\nBecause he was dealing with the awful deluge of magic and knowledge, Jin became way too sensitive. Although Lee Shin Woo picked out and organized only the helpful parts, it was a level 6 bone, so the original owner’s thoughts and power were on another level...\n\"Shin Woo, it’s way too hard for me to absorb magicians’ bones. This much magic knowledge is plenty, so couldn’t you just give me a stupid warrior’s bone instead...\"\n\"I guess it can’t be helped. Then let’s go with a monster without intellect instead.\"\nSince elite magicians’ bones were really rare, he only had two anyway. But he did have several monster bones which emitted tremendous amounts of mana that Jin couldn’t refuse.\n[Jin Taylor is reinforced through Bone Reinforcement. A large portion of memories and experiences are divided and absorbed. Magic has increased by 2. Proficiency in the Intermediate Mana Bone skill has increased by 9%.]\n[Jin Taylor is reinforced through Bone Reinforcement. A large portion of memories and experiences are divided and absorbed. Magic has increased by 1, and Strength by 2. Proficiency in the Intermediate Mana Bone skill has increased by 4%.]\n[Jin Taylor is reinforced through Bone Reinforcement. A large portion of memories and experiences are divided and absorbed. Magic has increased by 4...]\nBecause he’d absorbed 10 bones in a row, Jin looked half-dead. They were level 6 bones, plus they were all bones focused on magic, which Jin lacked in, so his magic stat had increased by almost 200!\nLee Shin Woo had gotten a portion of those stats and his own magic increased by 30, so nothing else needed to be said. Moreover, his fire element increased by another level, so now it was at low rank level 8. Lee Shin Woo trembled at the power of money.\n\"So thrilling, so refreshing. Money truly is the best!\"\n\"I’d rather die! Kill me!\"\n\"I’m done with your share, so just keep rolling over there.\"\nWhile Lee Shin Woo’s fire element was the only thing that leveled up, it seemed as though Jin gained three or four new skills.\nMost of them were skills that supplemented his magic, so they should help him use Steel Heart from now on; Jin would have to develop and evolve those skills in a direction that suited his growth.\n\"It’s my turn now...\"\nLee Shin Woo examined each of the lined up 14 bones in order. The level 7 bone was the main dish, so he had removed it for later, and the other 13 bones were placed in order by how much mana they emitted.\nIf there were one thing he regretted, it was that all the level 6 bones seemed much weaker compared to the level 6 bone he’d gotten in the past, the Weapon Trickster’s bone.\n’I suppose that’s obvious. It seems like the Weapon Trickster was an extremely rare karma... and it was also the reward of an important quest.’\nHe decide to accept it, as the bone he’d acquired as a quest reward was just that good.\nLee Shin Woo carefully reached his hand towards a bone. It was a red bone; amongst the bones, it seemed like it would increase his health significantly.\n\"Bone Reinforcement!\"\n[Executing Bone Reinforcement by consuming the Lv6 Big Mino Fighter, Eldur’s head horns. Health has increased by 14, and Strength by 3. You have learned the active skill, Lv8 Low Rank Twin Horn Charge.]\n[Grr... My charge won’t stop until it breaks either you, or me. - Mino Charge Commander, Eldur]\n\"Huh?\"\nHe thought that it would be impossible for him to learn new skills the more he and his skills leveled up, because the scope of his skills became wider, but that was just arrogance at work. Until now, he’d relied on Jin’s charge skill, but now he had his own charge related skill.\n\"Twin Horn Charge.\"\nLee Shin Woo said softly, and two tough horns, comprised of mana, formed atop his bone helm. At the same time, he felt as though someone was forcefully pushing him from behind.\nHe would let the skill take over, dash forward, and strike his opponent with the twin horns; that was the technique.\n\"You’re really like a monster.\"\n\"Nothing new.\"\nJin, who had stopped rolling on the floor, looked at Lee Shin Woo and gave him his honest opinion; Lee Shin Woo replied curtly and deactivated the skill. It was definitely a good skill that would increase the power of his charges, but it wasn’t really his type of skill. However, he had a chance to refine this skill.\n’Fortunately, the mana pattern that manifests this skill isn’t very complicated. You charge quickly with the Twin Horn Charge skill, and simultaneously focus your strength in the horns; the Minos created this skill for that very reason. If I change that part around a bit then I might be able to...’\nHe didn’t think for very long. Lee Shin Woo was really eager to work on the skill, but it wasn’t that easy to solve. It was more important to absorb the rest of the bones for now.\n[Executing Bone Reinforcement by consuming the Lv6 Great Hornet’s reinforced exoskeleton. Agility has increased by 8, and Magic by 4.

Proficiency in the Bone Reinforcement skill has increased by ??%.]\n[The Lv6 Dotorus’ toe bone...]\nEach level 6 elite monster possessed their own inherent quality and growth. In the process of absorbing their various skills, Lee Shin Woo’s skills advanced more than he’d thought they would. Amongst them, this was the greatest one.\n[Executing Bone Reinforcement by consuming the Lv6 Bewitcher’s rib bone. Health has increased by 7, and Magic by 9. Proficiency in the Acting, Disguise, and Instigate skills have increased by 19%.]\n’Mm.’\nA Bewitcher was a rare monster that used their own mana to captivate and control their enemies. They used a type of mana that possessed an extremely dangerous property, and when he absorbed its bone, the proficiency of all three of his Joker’s innate skills increased. Lee Shin Woo learned quite a bit from that.\n’A Bewitcher’s mana... If I can master this mana, I should be able to grow significantly as a Joker.’\nOf course, it wasn’t that easy. If he were able to proficiently use a Bewitcher’s mana by just absorbing one bone, then Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t have had to study a golem’s mana for so long. Thɪs chapter is updated by novｅlfire.net\n’But it’s true that I’ve gotten a hold of a hint. If I meet another one of these later, then...’\nLee Shin Woo engraved the Bewitcher’s pattern that both manifested and controlled their mana deep within his mind. He promised he would practice using the Bewitcher’s mana pattern the next time he used his Joker skills.\nHe now only had one bone remaining. It was none other than the level 6 magician’s finger bone that Jin had refused.\n\"You didn’t change your mind, right?\"\n\"Don’t come this way with that thing!\"\n\"Alright, alright.\"\nJin was really startled, and continuously rolled on the floor; seeing that, Lee Shin Woo snickered and activated Bone Reinforcement. Then...\n[Executing Bone Reinforcement by consuming the Lv6 Royal Magician, Celon Von Betadorn’s finger bone. You have exceptional compatibility with the target, so the skill is a resounding success!

When had he seen that message before? Right. It was when he’d absorbed the Anti-Skull cooperator, Gerrit’s bone!\nHe’d succeeded in preserving his memories, but the moment Lee Shin Woo sported a joyous expression, his consciousness faded.",

    "content": "<Chapter 19. Clean Up - 5>\nIt was an extremely dark, underground secret room. It had the same vibe as the Anti-Skull secret facilities he’d found.\n\"You’re a disappointment, Gerrit.\"\n\"Senior...\"\nHe could hear the two men’s voices through his ears; one of their voices was familiar, and the other was unfamiliar.\n\"Senior Betadorn... Did you really have to go this far?\"\n\"It would’ve been better had we had just taken it easy.\"\nAt that moment, Lee Shin Woo’s consciousness became clear. He quickly realized what kind of situation he was in, perhaps because this was his second time experiencing this. Hadn’t he experienced something like this when he had absorbed the level 4 magician, Gerrit’s bone?\nIt was a playback of memories that came about due to Bone Reinforcement’s resounding success! As he acquired the much too clear memories and experiences, he would feel a sense of unity with the bone’s original owner, to the point that he felt one with them!\n’Gerrit’s here too.’\nSeeing the owner of a bone he’d absorbed right before him was quite a strange sight. Moreover, it looked like Gerrit was heavily injured, causing his feelings to abate. The perpetrator was... the one whose consciousness he was inhabiting: Celon Von Betadorn.\n\"Take it easy... Senior, you don’t understand the true nature of your research!\"\n\"You’re the one who doesn’t understand, Gerrit.\"\nCelon sighed, and drew his mana. He felt the immense mana saturating Celon’s body whirl around him, increase in power, and focus into one hand. Eventually, what manifested in his hand was a high ranking magic, one which Lee Shin Woo couldn’t understand at all!\n\"That, kuhahk!\"\nThe moment light radiated from his fingertips, Gerrit wasn’t even able to resist and fell to the floor, as if he had been bound. Perhaps it restricted both one’s body and mana, as Gerrit’s mana peculiarly didn’t respond thereafter.\n\"Senior! In the end... do you really have to go this far!?\"\n\"I hoped that I wouldn’t have to kill one of my precious juniors... I’ll ask you one last time.\"\nCelon’s voice was ice cold. Lee Shin Woo could feel the torrent of mana that amassed in his palm so well that he trembled. He had felt this from Kratia as well, but his mana couldn’t compare with that of a level 6 magician’s.\n\"Tell me what you know about the Anti-Skull organization in detail. Who’s in charge?\"\n\"Urgh, don’t you already have an idea as to who... ugh!\"\nA portion of his mana extended like an arrow and severed one of Gerrit’s arms. Celon’s eyes were tinged with spite.\n\"You’re missing the point, Gerrit. You’re a magician.\"\n\"You’re the one who’s missing the point, Senior.\"\n\"...Is that really what you think?\" Read full story at novel·fire·net\n\"Then can you really say you’re not!?\"\n\"You fool...! You only think about yourself!\"\nIt was only for a mere moment, but he felt Celon’s eyes look upon Gerrit with an unbearable amount of loathing and contempt. Even whilst groaning in pain, he suddenly yelled at him.\n\"I’m not the only one! You’ll kill not just me, but the entire Empire itself! Everyone’s crazy! Eternal life? That’s just an illusion!\"\n\"We know that already! If it were that easy to attain, it wouldn’t be eternal life!\"\n\"Then why!?\"\n\"...Hoo.\"\nGerrit’s throat was congested with blood. However, Celon wouldn’t speak on Gerrit’s terms any longer. Was it because he’d decided that there was nothing he could gain from speaking to Gerrit? Once more, mana was concentrated within his hand.\nUnfortunately, the pattern he used to control his mana wasn’t very different; however, experiencing his smooth and skilled technique of handling mana would help Lee Shin Woo for a long time to come.\n\"I didn’t really need to get any information from you. I was just trying to give you an opportunity, as we were once alumni... You have only yourself to blame, Gerrit.\"\n\"You’re making the wrong choice...\"\nCelon’s magic shot in a straight line. The focus of such magic was to burn away the opponent’s magic, and said magic would overpower the opponent with solely mana quantity. Obviously, Gerrit wasn’t able to resist the spell and vanished; ultimately, only two bones that radiated light remained.\n\"This is... a keepsake of his teacher, huh. ...He sacrificed himself for the Empire. You respected him so much, yet you joined an organization like Anti-Skull...\"\nCelon mulled over whether he should incinerate the two bones, and ultimately, he decided against it and placed them within his breast pocket. Lee Shin Woo recollected that Gerrit had collected his teacher’s bone, and had now realized something.\n’I might’ve already absorbed Gerrit’s teacher’s bone.’\nLee Shin Woo’s consciousness became dim after that final realization. Even till the very end, Celon was gripped by anger and a bitter regret.\nWhat exactly caused Celon to be so angry, and why did he agree to cooperate with the Emperor when he didn’t think that eternal life was possible? Unfortunately, Lee Shin Woo couldn’t find the answers to these questions and was dragged back to the present. Since it wasn’t something he could know just yet.\n[You have become skilled in drawing your mana without any waste. The Intermediate Mana Bone skill has become Lv5, and mana has increased by 20. You have become able to more adeptly absorb the mana around you.]\nCelon Von Betadorn was definitely extremely talented. Since Lee Shin Woo’s Mana Bone skill, which had leveled up to level 4 from his exchange with Kratia, had leveled up again!\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo couldn’t feel happy about that forever. Seeing Gerrit’s death, as well as the confrontation between Anti-Skull and the researchers for eternal life caused him unease. Furthermore, everything that Celon had said had bothered him.\nAt that very moment, a quest appeared, as if it understood him.\n[A quest has occurred!]\n[Anti-Skull’s objective]\n[The horrific curse that came about due to the Emperor’s struggle for eternal life. Anti-Skull did everything they could to stop it, but they ultimately failed. And you have successfully caught a few glimpses of their actions.]\n[However, that’s not enough. Somewhere in the Empire, they’re still waiting for their time to strike. Find a member of Anti-Skull who is an executive or higher to get closer to finding out the secret of the Empire.]\n[Quest rewards - 3 permits to God’s secret shop, a corresponding amount of Perium]\n\"...It’s been a long time since I’ve gotten a quest.\"\nThis quest was incomparably vague compared to the quest he’d begrudgingly accepted from God. Also, the words were cryptic. It didn’t even tell him where the Anti-Skull members were located, nor did it tell him what to do once they met; it was a really unfriendly ending.\nHe sported a sour expression as he looked over the quest once more, and Jin, who seemed to be done rolling on the floor\nHe sported a sour expression as he looked over the quest again. Jin, who seemed done rolling on the floor, stood up, dusted himself off, walked over, and asked..\n\"You got a quest, right?\"\n\"Yeah. So you’re at the level now that you can sense this flow of mana, huh. I’m proud of you.\"\n\"You know, that tone of yours kind of pisses me off...\"\nHowever, his abilities concerning magic were nothing compared to Lee Shin Woo’s; plus, Lee Shin Woo was the reason he was able to increase his magic this far, so he couldn’t really retort very strongly. Finding no alternative, Jin promised to get revenge by shaking like crazy once Lee Shin Woo rode on him next.\n\"You don’t have to worry about it too much, as it’s a quest that I can’t really do anything about right now. This guy’s more important than the quest right now.\"\nThe secret to the Empire’s curse? That’s important. Anti-Skull? That’s important too. Level 5 Intermediate Mana Bone? That’s obviously important. However, he held something more important than all of those; it was the only level 7 elite bone that he’d bought from the secret shop!\n\"When you think about it, that probably means that there aren’t that many high leveled heroes.\"\n\"You told me that most heroes only hunt monsters that are a level lower than them. When you think about it that way, doesn’t that mean that there’s at least one level 8 hero?\"\n\"They told me that this bone entered the shops dozens of years ago.\"\n\"Ah...\"\nThat meant that there weren’t any level 8 heroes right now. Of course, Lee Shin Woo didn’t approach the subject so simply.\nA level 8 hero may not have encountered a level 7 elite monster, they may have defeated it and a bone didn’t drop, or they may have encountered a level 7 elite, but decided against fighting it, as they didn’t think that there was any need to fight it...\n\"Well, this bone is what’s important right now.\"\n\"I respect your bravery.\"\nJin saluted him, as Lee Shin Woo was attempting to absorb a level 7 elite bone; it was already difficult to absorb a bone that was one level higher, yet he was absorbing a bone two levels higher.\nSeeing that, Lee Shin Woo chuckled and grabbed the Giant, Fenno’s bone. Befitting a Giant, the bone was enormous; it was longer than the Drake Horn Lance. It was about 4 meters in length, was incredibly tough, and there was a horrific amount of mana concentrated within!\n\"My consciousness shouldn’t get sucked in again, right?...\"\nLee Shin Woo resolved himself and after calming himself down as much as possible, he executed Bone Reinforcement. At that moment, the shin bone broke apart into pieces and pervaded his entire body... not his shin!\n[The Giant, Fenno’s shin bone reinforces your entire body. Strength has increased by 30, Health by 20, and Magic by 15. Absorbing a significant portion of the target’s memories and experiences!]\nWhat a relief. He didn’t get a playback of the Giant’s memories. The Giant was much too detached and overpowering for Lee Shin Woo to share his senses with. Lee Shin Woo thought of it as watching a movie.\nPerhaps it was because it was a level 7 bone, but the memories within were almost completely intact when absorbed by Lee Shin Woo. Lee Shin Woo thought about the frightening product of a Giant’s body and magic, and wondered whether it would be possible for him as well.\n’A Giant’s mana... Their bodies are built larger and sturdier, and this is probably some type of authority. I don’t know what the basis for it is, but all of their mana is concentrated in reinforcing and enlarging their bodies, so I could say that there’s a certain harmony between magic and body at work here...’\nA huge body saturated with overpowering mana; they would infuse these two powers into their weapons in their entirety and swing them. This was a Giant’s power!\nLee Shin Woo clearly memorized it all: the powerful flow of mana that whirled around their bodies, the properties of said mana, as well as the chemical process that occured as that mana touched the body. His body didn’t even compare to a Giant’s body, but he would at least be able to use that mana someday.\n[I am! Descended from the Giants! I said I’m a descendent of the Giants, Fennos!]\nA descendent of the Giants. He didn’t know what exactly that meant, but for some reason, that line was engraved deep within his mind. That memory was what finished the Bone Reinforcement. As well as...\n[Inheriting the will of a mortal who attempted to reach the realm of God. Low Rank Avenger has been terminated.

You can use this ability when you are ambushed, fight against an opponent a higher level than you, or fight against several opponents.]\n[Whenever you attempt to overcome a particular situation with another, the effect of Rebellion will be further increased, based on your connection with the other.]\n[You became undead through contract fraud. You intend to rebel against this situation. All stats are increased by 10% at all times. This effect is also shared with the contracted, Jin Taylor, who is also in the same situation.]\n\"Ah, so this is what I get...\"\nLee Shin Woo felt the energy within his body rise, and sported a troubled expression. Jin, who suddenly gained an increase in ability due to their contract, was also completely shocked and leapt up suddenly.\n\"What is this? What the hell is this?\"\n\"Mm, we just a got skill that gives us a way to fight back.\"\nThough he explained the core of the matter, Jin unfortunately didn’t really understand. Lee Shin Woo couldn’t be bothered, so he just explained it away as a special buff, and Jin could understand that much.\n\"Rebellion, huh...\"\nChanging one’s emotions into power was good enough for it to be called a highest level (MAX) skill. Since the moment he gained the skill, his stats increased by 10% because he was a skeleton.\nIt was probably able to manifest in this form because it had fused with his previous Avenger skill. Truthfully, its effect was quite similar to the Avenger skill. It was quite a versatile skill compared to Avenger, which was way too choosey as to when it could be used.\n’If there are several special situations overlapping, it may increase my abilities by as much as a level. Moreover, the skill level is still at level 1, so the growth is limitless... Tch, is that it?’\nHe’d secretly wanted an active skill befitting a Giant that would reverse a situation in one go, so he was slightly disappointed; but since he knew just how important stats were in this world, he soon changed his mind.\nMoreover, he hadn’t completely lost a hold of a Giant’s ability. Since he’d memorized the flow of mana within Fenno’s body, as well as how he utilized it, he would be able to use that method someday soon. He hadn’t given up on his dream to turn into a Giant!\n\"Fine. In any case, I only have 600 stats to go before I hit level 6.\"\n\"You monster.\"\n\"Now it’s time for us to go.\"\n\"You have a place in mind, right?\"\n\"Yep.\"\nHonestly, he had a lot of places to choose from. It sounded fun taking control of all the golems in the various areas, and it wouldn’t be bad to start exterminating some of the undead heroes for God’s quest.\nIf not, he could use the faint memories held within the bones he’d absorbed to find the Bewitchers or Giants, which he didn’t feel would be a waste of his time.\n\"However, we have to go somewhere first. To be honest, I acquired some interesting info in the process of wiping out Vitas’ corps.\"\nIn the process of directly or indirectly absorbing the memories of all the undead in the corps, he’d gained detailed information on one of the Empire’s 12 generals, Metafel.\nHe knew where the undead general was right at this very moment, as well as the movements of the soldiers he led.\n\"You’ve got guts... Oh wait, never mind. [1]\"\n\"It seems like you’re misunderstanding me right now. I’m not crazy enough to go fight one of the 12 generals myself. I just got a hold of some interesting info while I was going through the memories.\"\n\"You don’t still think that the way you think is normal, do you?\"\nLee Shin Woo looked at the uneasy Jin, grinned, and explained.\n\"Vitas’ corps was supposed be double its size. However, he lost half of his troops while they were on the move. Why do you think these guys died?\"\n\"On the way, they encountered Treasure Eaters holding a choir competition?\"\n\"Funny, but no. There’s something more formidable there.\"\nLee Shin Woo said and nodded as if satisfied, but seeing that, Jin’s goblin fire swayed uneasily.\n\"You’re not saying that we’re going to go kill those formidable guys, are you?\"\n\"Bingo!\"\n\"Stop, you crazy bastard! You just said that they killed half of the corps!\"\n\"Nope. Jin, listen closely.\"\nLee Shin Woo experienced the same anguish that all the undead had felt, and that source was none other than acid. It was such a powerful acid that it melted away the bones filled to the brim with mana and nullified it! It was definitely a more powerful acid than the one used by the Great Slime or the Acid Ghoul.\n\"Vitas thought he might have to sustain heavy casualties to escape and ended up sacrificing half of his troops; then, he turned his corps around and marched. Why? It’s because most skeletons don’t possess Acid Resistance.\"\n\"You...\"\nJin already realized what Lee Shin Woo was trying to say. Lee Shin Woo spoke in a strong-willed tone, as if he wouldn’t take back his decision, regardless of what Jin said.\n\"But we have it. We have Acid Resistance!\"\n\"You said it had stronger acid than the Acid Ghoul!\"\n\"Jin, a person can’t lose their aspirations. Just because we increased our magic or physical strength a little bit doesn’t mean we should keep fighting against skeletons or golems; if we do, we’ll eventually face an opponent that can use a powerful element that cannot be overcome with just stats and that’ll be our ticket to the afterlife.\"\n\"We’re going to the afterlife right now. Right now!\"\n\"Oh, c’mon. I keep telling you not to worry.\"\nHe had been feeling troubled because he hadn’t had much of an opportunity to train his Regeneration skill lately, as most of his fights would end in a single round. However, he’d gotten information that there were monsters that used acid that inhabited a particular region, so he couldn’t not be happy!\n\"Then the reason you’re not telling Kratia about it is...?\"\n\"Yeah. She’s definitely strong, but she’s not really helpful when I want to train my skills.\"\nThat was the expected response. Jin was sure that he wouldn’t be able to change Lee Shin Woo’s mind, now that he’d made his decision, so he weakly asked.\n\"So, who are they? The ones that use acid. A Hyper Ultra Acid Ghoul?\"\n\"Nope. Trees.\"\n\"Trees...\" Get full chapters from n͟o͟v͟e͟l͟f͟i͟r͟e͟.net\nJin couldn’t understand at all and tilted his head, but Lee Shin Woo couldn’t really say anything else to clear it up for him. Because according to their memories, the undead had indeed been killed by the acid poison spewed out by the numerous trees in the forest!\n\"In any case, they’re trees, so they can’t move, and there’s no way it’ll be a waste of time. That’s why I want to go there first.\"\n\"Mm, they’re trees... so can you even get something from slaughtering all those trees? Aren’t they just plants?\"\n\"You’ve adapted quite well to this world now, haven’t you? The fact that every action remains as karma. Don’t worry, it definitely won’t be a waste of time.\"\nAfter he had roughly explained the location, as well as their objective there, Lee Shin Woo lightly kicked off the ground and embarked on Jin’s back. Jin turned his body to the direction of their destination, even as he sighed. Due to the Assimilation skill, he didn’t need to be told where to go.\n\"With your speed, it shouldn’t even take a few hours.\"\n\"Hoo, is this really a good idea...\"\nAfter the two skeleton heroes were finished with everything, they finally left Kehebe. Due to Jin’s speed, the sight of the city quickly became distant, and eventually, around the time they could only see it as a speck, Lee Shin Woo sighed (that kind of feeling); the sigh was mixed with both regret and relief.\nIn a short time, they had not only purified the city, but also discovered a winery nearby, met an elf hero, and even exterminated a corps under the direct command of one of the 12 generals. However, to Lee Shin Woo the most important moment was when he exchanged information and knowledge with Kratia.\n’Because of her, my magic fundamentals increased significantly too.’\nIt also wasn’t bad that he had secured an ally in a talented hero. Furthermore, Jin, who was in a similar situation to him, gained a sense of emotional stability, as well as other emotions from her due to their talks; though he wasn’t able to tell her that because he was shy, she played a huge part in helping him.\nThough he had become a Joker who fabricated his own feelings, it didn’t mean that he didn’t need his feelings. Rather, it was because he had to do so that the exchange of feelings was so important. Kratia had filled in that deficit for him.\n\"You’re thinking about Kratia right now, aren’t you?\"\nThen Jin, who had silently been running, suddenly opened his mouth and spoke. Because they weren’t deeply using the Assimilation skill, Lee Shin Woo responded a bit surprised.\n\"You’re really sharp...\"\n\"...\"\n\"The fact that you’re talking about Kratia means that you like her, right? Ah, what is it? Why are you shaking?\"\n\"The ground’s just bumpy, that’s all.\"\nJin lied unconvincingly and harassed Lee Shin Woo. As expected, did Jin have some sort of complicated feelings for Kratia? The feelings didn’t seem romantic, but he couldn’t really make any sort of guess.\nWith those complicated feelings, he accessed the chatting channel. It had halfway become a habit to access the chatting channel when he travelled long distances.\n[Mr. Lee Shin Woo has entered.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Oh, I was worried, but you came out safe.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: It’s a relief that you’re safe, Senior. I was able to escape beforehand because of Senior Erian.]\nNo matter how complicated he was feeling, as soon as he accessed the chatting channel, he would unhesitatingly and skillfully begin to lie. If he were to say ’actually, I killed them all’, it would become quite troublesome.\n[Prince Altania: I would’ve been able to take care of them.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Though you might be able to inflict a lot of damage with a preemptive strike, it would be difficult for you to win against the entire corps. You’re still quite a ways away from level 7, right? Let’s not be unreasonable until we hit level 7.]\n[Prince Altania: Ugh...]\n[Yasunori Akira: It requires quite a bit of courage to realize that you can’t do something and back off. Good job, Lee Shin Woo.]\nHe didn’t even run, yet he was being complimented for running; Lee Shin Woo wanted to get out of this situation as soon as possible. However, he had just entered, so he couldn’t just exit immediately with the excuse that their attention was too burdensome on him. Like always, he would need to bear with it a bit more so that he could hear what’s going on from his seniors. However.\n[Shino Rendu: But there are also situations where you can’t run away, no matter how much you want to.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Shino?]\n[Mentes Orun: ...Are you in danger?]\nAh, a senior he’d never seen before had appeared! Moreover, he seemed like quite the veteran! However, now didn’t seem like the time to introduce himself and say that it’s nice to meet him. Shino Rendu’s voice was unusual.\n[Prince Altania: Hey, it hasn’t even been very long since Ye Jin Jin almost died. I thought you were good at running away.]\n[Shino Rendu: Those pointless provocations of yours feel quite warm right now... But I don’t think I’ll last very long this time. I think I’ve been caught by one of the 12 generals.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: What? You...]\n[Mentes Orun: You should all know that the undead communicate with each other, starting from the level 3 danger zones. It’s possible to get caught by one of the 12 generals if they’re close by. And we’ve already told you guys about that once.]\n[Shino Rendu: I’m not trying to blame you, Senior. Honestly, I’m not trying to blame anyone.]\n[Yasunori Akira: You musclehead...]\nEven Yasunori Akira, who always spoke coldly, spoke in a withdrawn voice. So much so that Lee Shin Woo could even hear his voice break. The mood was becoming the same as when Ye Jin Jin requested for help.\nOf all the times that Lee Shin Woo could enter the chatting channel, this was the worst. He clicked his tongue. Moreover, he was caught by one of the 12 generals, so no matter who went, no one would be able to help him.\n[Shino Rendu: Newbie... No, Lee Shin Woo.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: Yes, senior.]\n[Shino Rendu: Don’t die like me. Don’t overdo it for the sake of quickly advancing. Since the only thing on our side here is time.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: ...I’ll keep that in mind.]\n[Shino Rendu: Is Seira not here right now... Someone please tell Seira that I always yearned for her. I know her heart’s frozen and she won’t accept anyone, but in the end, I...]\n[Prince Altania: You surprise me, even to the very end. That’s the kind of thing that hurts people the most, you idiot.]\n[Shino Rendu: And... no, that’s enough. At any rate, I was given a second chance at life. It’s been great.]\nWith that, Shino Rendu left the chatting channel. No one said anything, but then, Prince left without a word. Following him, Akira left, and then Lloyd. Lee Shin Woo was about to leave the channel, but the final remaining senior stopped him.\n[Mentes Orun: You’re Lee Shin Woo, right? When you hit level 6, send me a private chat. ...I’ll tell you about some level 3 danger zones that you can go through relatively safely.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: Thank you, Senior.]\n[Mentes Orun: It’s been a long time since I last entered the channel, but I feel really shitty... I’m going to go drink the wine that’s new at the shop now. Damn it.]\nFinally, that senior left as well. This senior wasn’t superfluous, nor did he have any sort of suspicious, secret plan; he just purely wanted to help his junior as much as he could.\nThe fact that that senior was so sick of entering the chatting channel must have meant that countless heroes have died in the Empire. Then...\n’Ah, there’s another one now.’\nThere was another mark indicating a new undead hero on his minimap. He would be able to get there in two days with Jin. And that meant that it was highly likely that Shino Rendu was killed by the Mercenary King, Metafel, of the 12 generals.\n’I can’t go that way for now.’\nTo think that he was thinking this way, despite the fact that Shino Rendu, a senior that he’d conversed with a few times, had died. Lee Shin Woo was surprised by his composure, and smiled bitterly; then, he left the chatting channel.\nThere was still a bit of distance remaining until he reached the forest containing the trees that spewed Acid Poison.\n[1] T/N: It’s an idiom regarding his liver again (being bold/reckless/gutsy). The second part is referring to the fact that Jin is belatedly remembering that Lee Shin Woo doesn’t have a liver.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 20 part1",
    "content": "<Chapter 20. Forest of the Dryads - 1>\nThis was a world where skeletons and golems walked the earth, and where rats could speak. Because the world was such, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t surprised in the least at the thought of trees spewing Acid Poison.\n\"Ugh. The energy coming from the forest is no joke...\"\n\"Hmm, guess not.\"\n\"What?\"\nBut when they arrived at the forest, which had cut Vitas’ troops in half and caused him to retreat, Lee Shin Woo had to correct his past judgment. The forest wasn’t just filled to the brim with trees. No, to be more exact, there was something else aside from the trees.\n\"Maybe Erian would’ve known...\"\n\"That girl... Wait, why are you talking about an elf? Because it’s a forest?\"\n\"It just feels like an elf would be more accustomed to dealing with things like that.\"\nLee Shin Woo looked at the vast forest before them... and shrugged his shoulders, observing the area spewing out rotten and withered mana.\nThe undead, who didn’t even possess clear egos, might’ve seen it as the trees attacking all of a sudden, but to Lee Shin Woo...\n\"I see something stuck to the trees. They might be spirits.\"\n\"Ah, now that you mention it, it definitely seems like...\"\nIt possessed an extremely pale complexion, and looked like an expressionless old lady; the ones stuck to the tree didn’t seem to be in healthy condition.\n[Lv5 Corrupted Dryad (Elite)]\n[Lv5 Acid Great Tree]\n\"Ah, as I thought.\"\nLee Shin Woo, who could ascertain their identities, was naturally given information pertaining to them as well. Dryads, or spirits who live in the trees! If dryads were to become undead, that’s exactly what he thought they’d look like.\n\"Did they become like that because the dryads latched onto the trees, which should’ve withered and died, and supplied them with mana?\"\n\"If that’s the case... That’s kind of sad.\"\nAs a result of their efforts to save the trees, the Dryads and the trees both became ghastly. Though Jin sported a bitter expression, Lee Shin Woo patted his back and comforted him.\n\"But because of that, we can kill both the dryads and the trees. That’s all karma.\"\n\"...\"\nThere were a ridiculous amount of trees within the forest, whereas there weren’t that many Corrupted Dryads managing the trees. That meant that the dryads were skilled enough to transform all the trees in the forest into level 5 monsters, despite being low in number!\n\"If they’re that skilled, then we’ll get a better reward to compensate. Plus, they seem like a rare species.\"\n\"Your cruel way of thinking has made my budding tears wither and die.\"\n\"Good. Let’s cry after we send them all off!\"\n\"Seriously, what color is your blood!?\" [1]\nLee Shin Woo activated the Assimilation skill prior to entering the forest, and shared his Acid Resistance to the best of his ability, like what he’d done when he had first fought Kratia.\nBack then, he’d only had a connection with Jin through Horseback riding, but now that his Assimilation skill had developed significantly, he was able to completely share his level 9 Low Rank Acid Resistance with Jin.\n\"The effectiveness of your own Acid Resistance should go up as it levels.\"\n\"You’re not planning on quickly breaking through, right?\"\n\"Yeah. I’m going to cut them down one by one. Just think of the acid as a ’mist sauna’.\"\nThere probably weren’t a lot of people who could call immersing their body into acid the same as a mist sauna. Jin sighed and took a step forward towards the forest.\nLee Shin Woo performed a final inspection of his gear before they entered the forest. He obviously wore the Acid Bone Full Armor, as there really wasn’t any other option. This full armor, which covered his entire body, increased the effectiveness of his acid type abilities by 40%, so it would naturally increase the effectiveness of his Acid Resistance. Therefore, he could say that he was all set.\n’And my weapon will be the Melting Bone Double Axe.’\nThe Melting Bone Double Axe likewise had an option that increased the effectiveness of his acid type abilities by 20%. Even though Lee Shin Woo knew that the acid mist within this forest was more powerful than the Acid Ghoul’s, the reason he entered without any hesitation was because this was a place where he would be able to improve his Acid Resistance.\n\"If I use some other tricks, I can reduce the acid damage even further, but I’ll make that call after seeing their acid attacks.\"\n\"Yeah, you’re so amazing.\"\nThey weren’t low leveled enemies, and each and every tree was level 5, yet Lee Shin Woo didn’t think of them as anything more than a training center for his skills!\nEven as he asked whether they could really go on like this, he continued to run forward, finding no other alternative. The moment they entered the forest, a Corrupted Dryad that seemed to act as the chief gatekeeper and was latched onto a giant tree noticed them!\n[Ggyaaaaaaaaaahk!]\n\"Ugh!? It’s not even a banshee!\"\nLee Shin Woo’s goblin fire contorted at the sudden sound wave attack. This was no joke; someone with eardrums would’ve sustained considerable damage from the attack!\n\"These senile old bags, how dare they try to teach me a lesson in screaming...\"\nLee Shin Woo grit his teeth, thinking about what method he would use to land the first strike, but soon changed his mind. He’d come here not to grow as a Joker, but to develop his Acid Resistance and Regeneration skills.\n\"Shin Woo, they’re coming!\"\n\"Yeah. I see them too!\"\nThe Dryad’s scream was the signal; all the trees began spewing out their Acid Poison all at once. It wasn’t a simple Acid Poison, as it seemed as though there was a suspicious compound mixed in. Fortunately, it seemed it didn’t really have much of an effect on Lee Shin Woo and Jin as they were undead.\n[You are being affected by a high ranked Acid Poison that has spread throughout the entire area. Reducing the damage of Acid Poison by at least 70%!]\nOf course, that wasn’t the end. After spewing the poison mist, the trees extended their branches towards Lee Shin Woo, as if they had become living organisms. The branches stretched like rubber bands, and were swung at them like whips!\n\"Heup!\"\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo was already well aware of how they would attack through the skeletons’ memories, and skillfully swung his axe, cutting bundles of branches that came flying towards him.\nThe tree branches possess a powerful Acid Poison as well, so when they made contact with a weapon, they’re supposed to corrode them. However, the Melting Bone Double Axe’s element was acid, so its blade remained intact despite cleaving through dozens of branches.\n\"Ugh. The poison’s getting worse...!\"\n\"Concentrate on our connection!\"\n\"I got... it!\"\nIn the process of cutting through the branches, the Acid Poison liquefied once more and spewed out; the cut branches more violently spewed out a higher volume of acid.\nIn terms of level, the Acid Poison was perhaps at a high intermediate level, and dozens or even hundreds of trees stacked that horrific Acid Poison, causing the effect to become even more violent than before! If it was like this from the start, he couldn’t imagine what it’d be like when they got deep into the forest.\n\"Shin Woo!\"\n\"Yeah, I know. It’s ok.\"\nJin wasn’t the only one suffering. Even his reinforced resistance couldn’t completely block the poison, as it started to slowly melt away his armor.\nLee Shin Woo calmly cleaved through the branches that lay beyond the poison, and inspected the condition of his armor. He carefully placed his hand atop the armor and muttered.\n\"Regeneration.\"\nRegeneration. It was an ability that restored his ’body’. However, like Lee Shin Woo had roughly expected, it activated properly and regenerated the melted armor. At that moment, his Regeneration skill, which he hadn’t had an opportunity to use in such a long time, leveled up.\n[The Low Rank Regeneration skill has become Lv8. Health and Magic have increased by 2. Regeneration speed increases.]\n’Good. As I thought, it does work.’\nNormally, Regeneration could only be applied to the body. That’s why he had de-equipped all of his gear when he had trained his Acid Resistance and Regeneration with the slimes.\nThat’s right. Previously, his Regeneration skill could only be used on his body. No, to be more exact, that’s how it was even to this day. There was only one thing that changed: the ’identity’ of his equipment.\n’I was sure after seeing that Rule of Bone applies to the equipment formed through Bone Armory... The equipment summoned through the stored information of Bone Armory are all considered my body.’\nIf his equipment were treated as his body, there wouldn’t be any reason for his Regeneration skill to not to work on his equipment too, would there? Lee Shin Woo had thought so, and in reality, he had been right on the money. As a result, Lee Shin Woo wore his full set of armor and started training.\nJin saw that moment of fraudulent healing, and screamed, his goblin fire quivering, even in the midst of enduring the Acid Poison.\n\"That’s unfair!\"\n\"You have Steel Body which protects your entire body.\"\n\"Eek...\" Thıs text ıs hosted at novel⚑fire.net\nAs they were affected by the Acid Poison, their respective resistances grew, and at the same time, Lee Shin Woo’s Regeneration skill (Steel Heart for Jin) was trained as well. Since the skills ultimately used mana, his Mana Bone skill was trained as well. This training method was like killing three birds with one stone.\n[Ggiaaaaaaaaahk!]\n\"Shut... up!\"\nAt the Dryad’s excited command, the branches flew towards them as one; Lee Shin Woo cleaved through the branches before they reached them, and in the spur of the moment, decided to train his defense zone as well. It was no longer killing three birds with one stone, but four.\nLee Shin Woo hectically swung his axe with both hands, clearing away the branches, and inwardly nodded his head in approval. This place, with branches flying in every direction, was perfect for training his defense zone with Bursting Thunder applied to it.\n’It’s not perfect yet, but... this is good enough. It’s much better than when I had to use my fists!’\nLee Shin Woo recollected his past training, even though it hadn’t been a few months since, and suddenly felt a sense of longing. Level 5 seemed so far away back then, yet he’d already reached it. Things had become a lot better compared to back then!\nAbove all, what he was most prideful of was the fact that he hadn’t died even once since then.\n\"Heup!\"\n[Gguaaaaaaaaahk!]\n[Ggiiiiiiik!]\nHe cleaved through the tree branches that flew from various angles, and proceeded 1 cm forward every minute for a while. As if answering the old dryads’ screams, Lee Shin Woo forcefully struck with his axe and finally succeeded in toppling one of the trees.\nHe’d verified before, but they were indeed normal level 5 monsters; with Rebellion in effect (status +10%), as well as reinforcing his axe with Rule of Bone, the trees couldn’t withstand a few blows and toppled to the floor.\n[Ggiaaaaaaaaaaaaahk!]\nAs soon as he cut through the rotted tree, the nearby Dryads emitted a truly horrific scream. Though they had become hideous, they seemed to retain their love for trees. The old womens’ screams were of genuine sadness, and even Lee Shin Woo felt a stir in his heart.\n[You have acquired an Acid Tree Root. It is transformed through Bone Reinforcement. You have acquired a Melting Bone Root.]\n[You have acquired 17,560 Perium.]\n\"Ugh. I’ll purify you all so that you don’t have to suffer any longer...!\"\n\"I saw you smiling, you asshole!\"\nThe skeleton who couldn’t help but smile, Lee Shin Woo, was bombarded by countless tree branches and Acid Poison once more. Lee Shin Woo’s goblin fire blazed as he swung his axe once again. It was time for the skeleton lumberjack to begin his felling operation in earnest.\n[1] T/N: I could’ve just interpreted this as \"are you really human!?\", but it could also be a reference to the Japanese series, Hokuto no Ken. It’s very similar to Rei’s line, \"what color is your blood?\"\nE/N: even though he has no blood...",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 20 part2",
    "content": "<Chapter 20. Forest of the Dryads - 2>\nAbout three days after entering the forest of rotten trees that was under the Dryads’ control, Lee Shin Woo had become trapped deep into the forest without knowing where he’d even come from (without looking at the minimap of course).\n\"It’s still like this despite cutting down every single tree that came our way...\"\n\"I want to just set this entire forest on fire.\"\n\"No way. At least, not yet.\"\n[Kyaaaaaaaaaaahk!]\nThe Dryads screamed with such great timing, as they were finished with their conversation. As if waiting for that signal, a group of Acid Trees’ sharp branches stretched towards them in all directions.\nLee Shin Woo tightly gripped his axe with both hands and swung while on horseback; he cleaved the approaching branches, with the closest taking priority.\n\"Hoo... Heup! Lightning Scatter!\"\nIt wasn’t possible without maintaining his speed; no, he needed to be even faster than that! His defense zone had been incredibly clumsy at the beginning, but it was easy to see that he’d fine tuned it now. To the point that he could feel what part of his body he needed to reinforce.\n[The Intermediate Bursting Thunder skill has become Lv4. Strength and Magic have increased by 10.]\n\"Holy crap. It felt like this was going to happen, but Bursting Thunder did actually level up. I was training my Acid Resistance, but now I’m just training my weapon skills.\"\n\"What are you talking about? You’re training your Acid Resistance and Regeneration plenty.\"\nHonestly, Jin was right. For the past three days, Lee Shin Woo and Jin were affected by the Acid Poison spewed by the Great Trees without even a second of rest. Like they were enjoying a mist sauna!\nIf someone else saw them, they might’ve thought that the two weren’t in any sort of pain, but despite them being undead, they did feel pain; and the forest’s Acid Poison wasn’t a tingling sensation, but it felt more like thick metal thorns violently piercing their bodies. It was the same now as well.\n\"Kuuuuuu.... This doesn’t hurt for you?\"\n\"It does hurt. But I knew this is what it would be like before coming in.\"\n\"Ah, seriously.\"\nThough Jin had a strong urge to just escape the forest by himself, he managed to endure with a peculiar athlete’s spite that, ’Lee Shin Woo is enduring just fine, so I can’t complain.’\nOf course, the results of that were clear. Lee Shin Woo’s Acid Resistance became intermediate level 2, while Jin’s became low rank level 7. Even his Regeneration skill, which was quite difficult to level up had already gone up to low rank level 9.\n’This guy couldn’t have been just some ordinary guy on his homeworld.’\nJin suddenly recollected the pain he’d endured over the past three days, but when he saw Lee Shin Woo calmly swing his axe from atop him, he grit his teeth.\nEven if he considered the fact that Lee Shin Woo was undead, and possessed a skill that protected against mental ailments, no ordinary salaryman would be able to endure that kind of horrific pain! At least, that’s how it was in Jin’s original world.\n’I wonder what Shin Woo did in his original world? Was he like me? Damn it, we’re partners, yet there’s too much we don’t know about each other. No, am I just too concerned about the past when it’s completely useless here?’\n\"Jin, one step to the left... Jin?\"\n\"Yeah, I know.\"\n\"Nice... Heup!\"\n[Kyaaaahk!]\nEven while inwardly gritting his teeth, Jin moved his body at the optimum time, assisting Lee Shin Woo’s own movement. It was like they were moving as one. That’s right. Lee Shin Woo and Jin’s connection (Assimilation) was developing by the day.\n[The Intermediate Assimilation skill has become Lv3. Agility and Magic have increased by 5. You can now match your breath with your target. You can guess what the other is thinking without even saying it.]\nBecause his Assimilation skill had risen from level 2 to 3, Lee Shin Woo’s own Acid Resistance was almost fully applied to Jin, and Lee Shin Woo succeeded in sharing Jin’s dynamic visual acuity, as well as the reflexes that came from his agility. Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on novel·fiɾe·net\n\"Heup!\"\n[You have acquired 17,220 Perium.]\n[You have acquired two Melting Bone Roots.]\nFrom the start, the reason he wanted to train his defense zone was because he wanted to maximize the effectiveness of those sluggish movements; as a result of his struggles...\nThe range at which he could perceive attacks through his dynamic visual acuity became wider, and because his reflexes likewise improved, he was able to stop attacks with his concise body movements. His defense zone had improved significantly, to the point that even a senior knight would click his tongue at the change.\n\"As I thought, it was a good idea to pick this spot.\"\n\"Are all the other heroes like this? They go to strange places to train?\"\n\"Uh... maybe?\"\nHe didn’t know about fighting against an entire undead corps, but he thought that the other heroes would definitely like this place, as it offered invaluable training (Acid Resistance, Regeneration, mana, weapon techniques) and wasn’t particularly that difficult if one possessed Acid Resistance (that’s what he thinks). Therefore, he did feel like telling the other heroes about it, but...\n\"It’s pointless telling the others about this place since this place will be gone by the time we leave...\"\n\"You say such scary things in such a nonchalant way.\"\n[Ggiiiiiiiiiiiiik!]\n\"Hmm, maybe I should train my fire element as well.\"\n\"In the end, you’re going with what I suggested. You’re going to burn the forest, huh...\"\nLee Shin Woo uninterestingly swung his axe and, as they passed by a tree that a Dryad had inhabited, Jin muttered in amazement. Lee Shin Woo didn’t hate the other heroes, but he fundamentally thought of himself first!\n[You have acquired 16,800 Perium.]\n[You have acquired a Melting Bone Root.]\nIn the beginning, he swung his axe several times just to get past them, but now, the trees always died in one hit. Though he had indeed figured out the way to kill them, the fact that he killed them in a single blow meant each and every strike was a critical hit.\nLee Shin Woo thought it would be strange if someone couldn’t land a critical hit, despite the fact that their enemies couldn’t move as their roots were embedded into the ground. However, the difficulty in cutting through a gigantic tree when there were hundreds of branches coming his way in all directions was beyond imagination.\n’I’ve somewhat grasped the basics of the defense zone. Now I have to more proactively use it... Fine, I can do it. Let’s try it.’\nHe had honestly only intended to train his Acid Resistance in the beginning, yet it had now become a time to train his combat fundamentals. It was worth doing, and was quite the satisfying situation!\nLee Shin Woo inwardly laughed satisfyingly. Jin, who seemed to have read him like a book, desperately yelled. He needed to desperately absorb the surrounding mana so that he could maintain Steel Heart!\n\"You idiot! The poison mist is still pervading our bodies! We’re still training our Acid Resistance!\"\nTwo days more passed, and his Acid Resistance had leveled up once more. At the same time, another skill leveled up as well.\n[The Intermediate Acid Resistance skill has become Lv4. Magic has increased by 10. Your understanding of acid deepens, and have acquired proficiency in acid type skills.]\n[Intermediate Acid has become Lv5. Magic has increased by 10. The acid’s density control has increased.]\nHe’d thought that this might happen, but his Acid element had leveled up following his Acid Resistance!\nThough Lee Shin Woo was happy about the level up, he couldn’t wait to acquire Fire Resistance or Lightning Resistance. While his elements wouldn’t hurt their master, would he have to make it so they could to obtain those resistances? If Jin heard about this, he would say that he’s a crazy bastard!\n\"You crazy bastard!\"\nEven though he couldn’t read his mind, Jin condemned him anyway. Of course, there was a different, valid reason for that condemnation.\n\"Why are you taking off a piece of your armor?\"\n\"Well, since my resistance leveled up too fast, their poison isn’t really working on my anymore... so I took off a piece of armor. See, my bone is melting. Now this is how you level up a skill.\"\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"\nHe was normally calm and composed and even had some cool parts to him, but why did he become so crazy over skill training!? However, what pissed Jin off the most was that when one gets familiar with that stupid behavior, they realize that he can only make those calls because he’s taking into consideration the most effective way to train!\n[The Low Rank Regeneration skill has become Lv10 and has evolved into the intermediate level. Severe injuries and status ailments can be restored. Health and Magic have increased by 10.]\nAs expected, maintaining a harsh training environment resulted in his Regeneration skill going up to the intermediate level in about another day! Now, aside from the Twin Horn Charge that he’d gained recently, as well as the low rank level 8 Fire element, all of his skills had grown to the intermediate level!\n\"Ah, my Steel Heart went up to the intermediate level too...\"\n\"See? It was effective training.\"\n\"Yeah, you’re right...\"\nJin replied while desperately gritting his teeth. Then, Lee Shin Woo discovered something, stopped his hand which had been swinging the axe, and spoke.\n\"More importantly, look over there.\"\n\"...Huh?\"\nJin raised his head at Lee Shin Woo’s call. There was a Dryad that had fallen and come out of the tree that Lee Shin Woo had just felled that flew deeper into the forest.\n\"Man, they’re helplessly running away again. You’re really not killing them?\"\n\"You’re supposed to save the best dish for last. And...\"\nWhenever the Dryads saw Lee Shin Woo, they would scream and command the trees to attack him, but they didn’t dare show up in front of Lee Shin Woo. And when he’d destroyed all the trees in the vicinity, they seemed to retreat into the deep depths of the forest.\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo had a method of stopping their retreat, but he didn’t do so. That’s because the Dryads who retreated deeper into the forest were acting as signposts for him.\n\"Signposts?\"\n\"Yeah. The answer’s there when you think about why the Dryads are protecting this dead forest and attacking trespassers.\"\n\"Isn’t it instinctual? They’ve become completely corrupted, and their sense of self seems faint.\"\n\"No. Though their consciousness has become weak, they’re still spirits. Moreover, why would they so desperately attack trespassers, and when they fail in defending it, why do they lose that hostile attitude of theirs and escape deeper into the forest... That means.\"\n\"That means?\"\nIt definitely meant that there was something they wanted to protect deep within the forest. That meant that they had something they wanted to protect, despite being corrupted! Lee Shin Woo was absolutely sure. Hearing that, Jin was in awe and muttered.\n\"Wow, you’re such an asshole.\"\n\"Why? I was just making a rational inference.\"\n\"You’re letting them escape so they lead you to that valuable thing of theirs.\"\n\"You noticed that? You’ve really grown...\"\nHe was right. Of course, his primary goal was to train, but if he could, why not kill two birds with one stone?! Since the Dryads were so desperately trying to protect it, that meant that it was definitely not something ordinary.\n\"Maybe it was their intention to allow this rotten forest to spread. The undead corps tried to pass through here, yet they had to make a detour, remember?\"\n\"Yeah. I’m sure they didn’t imagine that a demented bastard would call this place a training area and willingly enter it...\"\nIt’s much easier to run away than personally face something dirty. That was the same for heroes and undead. But what others considered dirty, Lee Shin Woo considered worth exploring.\n\"In our country, there’s a saying that heaven assists those who can help themselves...\"\n\"There’s a saying like that in our country too; it also says that heaven will protect those who are honest.\"\n\"I don’t believe in God!\"\n\"You liar!\"\nWould heaven aid Lee Shin Woo, or would it abandon him? Lee Shin Woo, who’d just decided become an atheist, didn’t really concern himself with whether it would or wouldn’t, and quickly urged to follow behind the Corrupted Dryads.\nJin stretched his legs, sighed, and began running after them.",

    "content": "<Chapter 20. Forest of the Dryads - 3>\nTen days had already passed since he’d entered the forest protected by the Corrupted Dryads. Lee Shin Woo had managed to increase his Acid Resistance and Acid element by one more level, and became more adept at incorporating lightning into his weapon; it felt as though Bursting Thunder would level up soon.\nHowever, he thought about something else whilst felling trees and diligently training his skills. He was thinking about what the Dryads were protecting!\n\"Isn’t a world tree most likely?\"\n\"Then shouldn’t undead elves have come out rather than Corrupted Dryads?\"\n\"It would be nice if it were a world tree...\"\nA rotten world tree; what a cool name! It felt like he would be subject to all the world’s misfortunes if he broke off a branch and held onto it. Plus, he could make a great weapon out of it!\n\"Enough with your delusions. Swing your axe already.\"\n\"I am swinging it.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s swung axe carried lightning’s powerful cutting power. Before the trees succeeded in perforating him with their outstretched branches, Lee Shin Woo cut right through them! They roared as he axed through them all at once. Following an inspection, he sighed in satisfaction.\n[You have acquired 21,050 Perium.]\n[You have acquired 2 Melting Bone Roots.]\nThe deeper they went into the forest, the stronger the Acid Great Trees were. There was a huge difference between a level 5 close to 1,600 in stats, and a level 5 close to 3,200 in stats. The fact that they left behind more Perium was proof that they were stronger than the ones from before.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo continued to kill the Acid Great Trees in a single blow, regardless of the fact that they were gradually getting stronger. His attacks were gradually becoming stronger as well!\n\"Hoo... Heup! Hap!\"\n[Ggiaaaaaaaaaaaahk!]\nThough he’d made great strides in Bursting Thunder and the defense zone since coming here, he’d learned how to ’strike at one’s weak spot’ the most; in other words, critical hits.\n’Critical Hit was a skill at first and was absorbed by Bursting Thunder. However, just thoughtlessly swinging my weapon around won’t improve the skill. I have look into it and develop it myself.’\nBursting Thunder is a skill that combines all close combat skills and is a top ranked combat technique, but it’s also incredibly difficult to level up precisely because it’s a top ranked skill. Furthermore, leveling up the skill didn’t mean that he would become proficient in every skill contained within it.\nThe world wouldn’t give him anything cheap. In order to master this supreme skill, Lee Shin Woo would have to put in the effort in various fields. Among those various fields, he felt like his current critical hit training was a key factor in mastering Bursting Thunder, which allowed him to attack quickly and explode forcefully.\n[You have acquired 22,510 Perium.]\n[You have acquired a Melting Bone Root.]\n\"Hoo, heup.\"\nHe didn’t have the chance to regain his breath, even if he toppled a tree. Suddenly, other tree branches came at him from all directions.\nThe deeper Lee Shin Woo got by following the Dryads, the more desperately the trees tried to stop him, and at some point, roots began bursting from the once unscathed ground. Of course, it was Jin’s job to deal with those.\n\"They’re cutting through my armor!\"\n\"Calm down, and cut the ones closest to you first.\"\n\"Easy for you to say!\"\n\"Hoo... more and more of them keep coming.\"\nThere were hundreds of them attacking from above, below, and the sides; fighting off the tree branches and the roots made Lee Shin Woo think of some comics and films he’d seen on Earth.\nIt would’ve been a nice scene if the branches were attempting to tie up an elf, rather than a skeleton horse and a skeleton, but... reality is cruel.\n\"Damn it, their movements are disgusting...!\"\n\"That’s why I told you to cut them before they tie you up. You have to protect your body too.\"\n\"I’ll break my back trying to match you...!\"\nIt took only about two days for Jin to get adjusted to the protruding tree roots, and consequently Lee Shin Woo had to endure atop Jin’s back, as if he were in a rodeo.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo shared Jin’s dynamic visual acuity and reflexes that came from his high agility, while Jin shared Lee Shin Woo’s calm and keen movements, as well as his situational awareness.\nHe didn’t do so often, but when he was in a desperate situation, Jin would use all of Lee Shin Woo’s ability to his advantage to survive. And the result of that was clear.\n[Critical Hit!]\n\"Hoo, we got out.\"\n\"Heup!\"\nJin was able to cut through the roots and Lee Shin Woo cut down the weakened trees one by one, toppling three trees in succession. Then, he finally managed to take a breath. Because they had cut down all of the trees nearby, they had temporary created a safe zone where they wouldn’t be attacked.\n[Ggyaaaaaaaaahk!]\nHe’d heard that scream so often that it sounded sweet to him now; he followed the Dryad’s scream and turned his attention to the source, and was close enough now that he could see the Dryad flying away. When he confirmed that he was indeed close, Lee Shin Woo’s goblin fire rotated round and round.\n\"It looks like the Dryads are gathered in one place... We might be able to see something interesting if we play our cards right.\"\n\"Like a level 6 elite?\"\n\"Ha!\" [1]\nLee Shin Woo began thinking about whether he had revealed to much of his intentions to Jin, but it was too late to start thinking about that. He smiled awkwardly and marked their corresponding location on his minimap. Then he turned his body around. It was in the opposite direction that he’d seen the Dryads go in.\n\"What?\"\n\"I’d love to go over there right now, but we’re not done training.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Shin Woo’s Acid Resistance still wasn’t at a level where it would prevent all of the trees’ Acid Poison mist damage! He had no plans of going to the center of the forest until he reached his goal.\n\"Moreover, if you consider the fact that their Acid Poison becomes stronger the deeper you go, the boss fight at this end of this will...\"\n\"Won’t it have a high rank Acid Poison...?\"\n\"Maybe.\"\n\"Ugggggggh.\"\nJin, who was already imagining that moment, silently screamed. This was much too harsh an environment for Jin, who had just reached Intermediate Acid Resistance. Read complete versıon only at ⓝovelFire.net\n\"That’s why we should keep training. We can’t let the sacrifices of the Dryads and this forest go to waste!\"\n\"I don’t think anyone thinks they’re sacrificing themselves for you...\"\nLee Shin Woo crisply ignored Jin’s muttering. His Acid Resistance was still only intermediate level 5. He didn’t have any time to waste if he wanted to train his Acid Resistance to the point that he’d take no damage from acid!\n[The Intermediate Assimilation skill has become Lv4. Agility and Magic have increased by 5. Sensing the range of assimilation gradually increasing.]\nTwo weeks had passed since they’d entered the forest. Now Lee Shin Woo could endure the Acid Poison with only a helmet on.\nThe Acid Skull Full Helm possessed an option that increased the effectiveness of acid related skills by 20%, but that alone wouldn’t be able to effectively protect Lee Shin Woo’s body from acid, and Lee Shin Woo’s body was still melting.\nBut because of that, that allowed him to train his Acid Resistance and Regeneration skills, so there was nothing better.\n[The Intermediate Regeneration skill has become Lv2. Health and Magic have increased by 5. Regeneration speed increases.]\n\"Good, good. It’s going smoothly. Rather, it feels like I still have some mana left over. I feel like I can melt a bit more...\"\n\"I want to learn that Regeneration skill too...\"\n\"If we meet a Rural Rat Queen later, let’s have a talk with her then.\"\nLee Shin Woo said, as he rubbed bone powder on the half dead Jin.\nAs he thought, that dungeon was an unusual and difficult dungeon. He’d found a few other rat dungeons after that, but he hadn’t been able to find any other queens.\n\"It seems like we’re still far off from going to the center since you still sound like you’re dying.\"\n\"Are you planning on training all of your resistances like this from now on?\"\n\"Uh... If I can...?\"\nThis was more efficient when compared to randomly hunting monsters and undead. In the process of training a variety of skills, not only do his stats increase, but his fundamentals improve as well.\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t a sick bastard who derived pleasure from the training itself, but he was the type that could endure the pain of training for the results.\n\"But using the defense zone is too easy now. I’m confident that they’ll never break through my defense.\"\n\"Then should we go further in now?\"\n\"We can’t, since our resistance training isn’t finished yet. ...Fine, I guess I have no choice but to use this method.\"\nWhenever Lee Shin Woo was about to try something new, Jin wouldn’t be able to hide his unease. What the hell was he attempting this time? How would it affect him? Jin was concerned and couldn’t put up with it.\nSuddenly, the Melting Bone Double Axe appeared in the air. It was different from the one Lee Shin Woo wielded. That meant it was created through Bone Armory.\n\"You...?\"\n\"I’m training Rule of Bone. It takes a lot of concentration to control the flying axe, so it’ll become harder to use the defense zone.\"\n\"...\"\n\"In my home country, there’s a saying that goes ’the hardships of youth are invaluable’.\"\n\"In my country, they say that ’hardship leads to success’... No, let’s stop.\"\nAs expected, Lee Shin Woo made the right call. It was no joke controlling the axe midair with Rule of Bone while maintaining the defense zone with the other axe. He almost died a few times, but Lee Shin Woo didn’t give up on controlling the axe.\nUltimately, three more days passed. Now he could maintain his defense zone with the axe in his hands whilst controlling the axe in the air; which cleaved through the trees and branches from afar. Then, Lee Shin Woo summoned another axe and controlled both at once while maintaining his defense zone!\n\"Ah, it becomes so much easier when I use two axes to slice through the nearby trees. I should send these guys a bit farther.\"\n\"You dumbass!\"\nJin screamed. It was business as normal, so Lee Shin Woo didn’t pay attention to him. Soon, the Rule of Bone skill leveled up and further increased his control. Though that just made Lee Shin Woo attempt to do things that were even more difficult...\n[The Bone Armory skill has become Lv5, and you can now maintain five pieces of equipment at one time. Health and Magic have increased by 5.]\nTime passed like that for a bit longer, and his Bone Armory skill finally leveled up. Because of his proficiency in the skill, he couldn’t even imagine not being able to equip armor! However, the moment Lee Shin Woo cheered at the skill level up, something else unexpected came with it.\n[Your magic stat has surpassed 1,000! You have acquired the title, ’One Loved by Mana’. Magic has increased by 10. Your body is reborn more magic friendly than before. There is high compatibility with your species, so Magic has further increased by 10.]\n\"Huh...?\"\nLee Shin Woo muttered as he felt a slight change in his body that accompanied the message.\nHis magic stat had already surpassed 1,000; that in itself was surprising. But he could understand that, since most of his skills had a close connection with magic. However, he suddenly gained a title and his body had undergone a change, so he didn’t take this lightly.\n’The chatting channel... I don’t want to cause another uproar, so I’ll have to ask Kratia about this later.’\nWhen Kratia gained the private chat function, she would message him first, so he decided that he’d ask her then. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and continued hunting. He didn’t see any signs of his training ending any time soon.\n[1] T/N: This is more like a gasp, but English doesn’t really have a good onomatopoeia for this.",

Magic has increased by 5. You are now confident that you can melt all metal and bone.]\n[The Intermediate Bursting Thunder skill has become Lv6. Strength and Magic have increased by 5. You should be able to cleave through lightning that descends from the sky.]\n[The Intermediate Mana Bone skill has become Lv6. Magic has increased by 20.]\n[The Rule of Bone skill has become Lv7. You have become more adept at reinforcing and handling bone with just your will.]\nA month and a half had passed since he’d come to the forest of the Dryads, training his Acid Resistance, Regeneration, Bursting Thunder, defense zone, Assimilation, Mana Bone, Rule of Bone, and Bone Armory; though he’d originally come to just train his Acid Resistance. Then, Kratia finally contacted him.\n\"So... it only happens the first time?\"\n[Yeah. You get that title for the first stat that reaches 1,000.]\nKratia’s voice was so cold, even through the chatting channel, that Lee Shin Woo could imagine her expression. Lee Shin Woo really liked her calm and restrained voice. Especially because he knew what would cause that cool-headedness to break.\n[It’s kind of like how level 5 determines what path you’re going to take. You become specialized in one stat, and in order to become more familiar with it, the stat develops even further. Of course, my stat’s magic since I’m a magician, but I heard that others specialize in a different stat.]\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t a magician, so he ended up becoming a bit uneasy.\n\"So it only happens the first time, huh... It makes me feel a bit uneasy.\"\n[If you just consider your combat abilities, you might think that your other stats should’ve grown first, but when you think about it, all of those abilities are connected to magic, so I think the outcome was inevitable.]\n\"Tch, that’s true.\"\n[Your bones are magic anyway, so it turned out well.]\nShe was right. Around that time, Lee Shin Woo decided to accept it. Then, Kratia changed the topic. Her voice became slightly sharp.\n[So did you find anything good in the place you kept a secret from me?]\n\"Haha, what are you talking about? There are no secrets between us.\"\n[...You seem to have gotten a lot out of it.]\nHe felt like Kratia was trembling, and laughed merrily as he imagined that, but Jin pressed him all of a sudden.\n\"Left!\"\n\"I know, it’s fine. I see everything.\"\n[Ggiaaaaaaaaahk!]\nObviously, Lee Shin Woo was in the midst of battle. Lee Shin Woo hadn’t stopped fighting even once in the last 45 days.\nEven though it was possible for him, as he was a skeleton, the mental strain was indescribable; nevertheless, he endured. Though, it was one of the main factors that accelerated his growth. Of course it was the same for Jin as well.\n[But it’s fine. Since I found something interesting as well.]\nHe was still talking with Kratia. Lee Shin Woo perversely thought that chatting with someone whilst fighting would help train his concentration, and listened carefully to what she had to say.\n\"Oh? And what’s that?\"\n[It’s a secret... is what I’d like to say, but I’ll tell you. Since I’m different from you. I’m an adult.]\n\"Yeah, yeah. You’re so mature.\"\nLee Shin Woo swung his axe, and shattered the clumped up branches that spun like a drill. Beyond that, the airborne axes flew to the tree’s main body and toppled it.\nAside from that, the other Acid Great Trees in various areas were being ambushed by the other axes within the air. He’d summoned one or two axes initially in order to train his defense zone, and at some point, that number had increased to 4. In other words, Lee Shin Woo was completely naked... or a nude skeleton. [1]\n[I’ve found traces of one of the 12 generals too.]\n\"Really? If it’s this easy to figure out, then our other seniors must know about it already.\"\n[Probably.]\nThey hadn’t yet realized that they were the greatest of the heroes that had come to this Underground Empire.\n[I killed some undead who were formerly royal magicians, and luckily managed to combine their mana into a single magical formula. One of the artifacts that they had responded to that, and released information.]\nOf course, the information contained within wasn’t very important. If the Empire still existed, then it would’ve been considered a third class secret; it was report data on the plan to expand the training facility for magicians who defended the capital. The problem was the one who prepared that data.\n[Head of the royal magicians, Feotane. He mentioned himself that he was one of the 12 generals, so he’s definitely one of them.]\n\"Head of the royal magicians...\"\nLee Shin Woo nodded his head naturally. Not all of the 12 generals would swing a sword or spear on the frontlines and command their troops on the battlefield. It was a fantasy world, so it made sense that a magician was a general.\n\"You just figured out the name? Nothing else?\"\n[I learned a bit about their communication system and codes. All that’s left is to inspect the training facility recorded in this report. I’m going to go over there right now.]\n\"Alright. Don’t die.\"\n[It’s connected to a magician, so I might ask for your help soon.]\n\"I’m not a magician...\"\n[Hoo... Relax. You may not consider yourself a magician, but someone else does.]\n\"I feel like I’ve heard something like that before.\"\nBy the time Lee Shin Woo finished his conversation with Kratia and raised his head, the area was completely cleared of trees. Lee Shin Woo sighed after retrieving the Melting Bone Double Axes that were violently spinning in the air.\n\"Their juniors are trying so hard, so would it kill our seniors to at least kill one of the 12 generals?\"\n\"You’re probably hoping that they sell that bone to the secret shop.\" Chapters fırst released on NoveIꜰire.net\n\"Exactly. The effect of a level 7 bone is tremendous, so what would a level 8 bone be like?\"\n\"I don’t think any of the 12 generals are going down until we hit level 8...\"\nHonestly, Lee Shin Woo thought the same. Their seniors may be heroes, but they were also humans with only one life, so there was probably no helping it... He sighed again and spoke.\n\"Let’s just do what we can.\"\n\"Are we finally doing it?\"\n\"Yeah. When I hit intermediate level 8, it didn’t seem like my Acid Resistance would level up no matter what I did, so it can’t be helped.\"\nLee Shin Woo said stiffly. All that was behind them was a vast plain. For a month and half, which seemed both short and long, they started from the outskirts of the forest and completely cleared out all the other areas except for the center of the forest where the Dryads ran off to.\nWhen killed, the trees would turn into mana and vanish, leaving only their loot behind, which was characteristic of this world; there were no traces remaining that indicated that this was a forest, and if one were to walk past this area, they would be oblivious to the fact that there was originally a forest here.\n\"It’s time to open the box of chocolates. [2]\"\n\"That’s from Forrest Gump! You really were from my world, weren’t you?\"\nHow was this possible? Jin didn’t react when he referenced animation, but as he thought, movies were a no-go! However, Lee Shin Woo acted two-faced, even in a situation like this.\n\"Maybe. The name of the book I read was different.\"\n\"A book...?\"\nAs expected, he was able to fool him with a simple lie! Lee Shin Woo acted as though he didn’t see Jin’s puzzled expression, and activated Bone Armory. Then, his body was completely equipped with a helmet, upper body armor, and lower body armor. He unsummoned one of his axes, but he still retained three other axes, excluding his own.\n\"...But will it really be ok?\"\n\"Yeah. By reducing the number to three, my control’s gotten a lot better.\"\n\"You’re such a scary bastard...\"\nLee Shin Woo had started training his Rule of Bone skill in order to perfect his defense zone, and had become even more powerful than before as a result.\nTo sum it up, awareness and control. If he was able to control his equipment with Rule of Bone, then he would be able to use them to attack his enemies, even in the midst of an intense battle. Moreover, if there was only one target to attack, he could control them as one, making it twice as easy to control them.\n\"I leveled up my resistance as much as I could, but I don’t know how high of a level the enemy is. So you have to concentrate on our connection as much as possible.\"\n\"You’re the one who let all the Dryads go.\"\n\"Haha, that’s all in the past.\"\nThe final Dryad had fled just a few minutes ago, but Jin couldn’t retort.\n\"There shouldn’t be any more Dryads left in this forest.\"\n\"Yeah. If we exclude that area, that is.\"\nThe deeper Lee Shin Woo followed the Dryads into the forest, the drearier and more frightening the energy became. At the end of it, the area was explicitly black, incomparable to the other areas of the forest.\nIt seemed as though the essence of the forest was gathering in one spot, like a slime being burnt to a crisp and leaving behind only its core.\n\"If the other areas were a level 2 danger zone, then that area seems like a level 3 or 4 danger zone...\"\n\"We’re level 5, so it’s ok. It’s not as scary as it looks.\"\n\"Can you stop trying to calm me down like I’m a kid...\"\nThey carefully began to move. With every step, they became more in sync, and their assimilation rate became even higher than before.\nTheir respective Acid Resistances combined and became one, increasing their effectiveness. They shared their stats, senses, and the advantageous parts of skills. They were changed.\nNow that it’d been about two months since he’d learned the Assimilation skill, they didn’t sleep as they were undead, and would maintain the skill in most situations; therefore, they were in complete sync.\n[Don’t come...]\n\"Ah, what a typical starting line for a boss fight...!\"\n[You’ll get hurt...]\n\"Doesn’t it sound like their voices are overlapping?\"\n\"As I thought, it looks like they’re fused together.\"\nHe’d let not one, not ten, but more than a hundred level 5 Dryads go. How monstrous would they become if they were to combine all their strength together into one body?!\n\"Shin Woo, the outer trees are...\"\n\"I see them.\"\nThough the trees would attack with their branches or their roots, they would never move on their own accord. However, they were uprooting themselves right now and going deeper into the forest!\n\"No, they’re not moving of their own accord.\"\nLee Shin Woo denied in the next moment. To him, it looked like the mana the Dryads’ spewed out was controlling and moving the trees.\nLee Shin Woo trembled. He realized that they were responding most splendidly to his decision to let them go.\n\"Most people would collapse, saying that they’re screwed...\"\n\"Jin, I said that they were level 5 before, right?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nThough Jin didn’t want to keep moving forward, he had no choice; Jin walked forward with a tearful face and replied. Lee Shin Woo (inwardly) smiled in satisfaction and spoke.\n\"That was a lie.\"\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"\nJin screamed with such great timing. The trees all around them uprooted themselves and walked towards the center of the forest. After that, a huge living being stood up from within.. No, it was because the trees had exposed it.\n[Lv6 Corrupted Tree Golem (Elite)]\n[You have encountered a fused monster. This gatekeeper was created through the accumulation of countless Corrupted Dryads’ wills, as well as the mana from the remaining withered trees! The Empire’s curse will weaken if you destroy it!]\nThough they had prepared for it, a large scale, nonstandard boss fight had begun.\n[1] E/N: In case you forgot (like I did), Bone Armory only allows him to summon 5 pieces of armor or weapons at the moment (4 flying axes and the Melting Bone Double Axe).\n[2] T/N: I believe this quote is loosely referring to the \"life was like a box of chocolates\" quote from Forrest Gump, which means they don’t know what’s coming next.",

    "content": "<Chapter 20. Forest of the Dryads - 5>\n[You have encountered an enemy a higher level than you. Rebellion increases all stats by 10%! Because of your partner, your stats increase by an additional 5%. All effects are shared with your partner.]\n\"Shin Woo, what did you do?\"\n\"Oh, it’s just a buff. It’s a buff that lets us overcome the insurmountable wall before us.\"\nAfter Lee Shin Woo confirmed that his Rebellion skill had activated, he nodded his head with satisfaction, and raised his head. The cause of the buff... was the enormous boss monster that seemed like an agglomeration of the forest.\n[Lv6 Corrupted Tree Golem (Elite)]\nThe Corrupted Tree Golem was entwined with countless trees, and the Dryads’ wills had entered in the spaces between, allowing for the creation of this fused monster!\nThey gathered a similar type of karma into one spot, sublimating it into an even greater karma; though its appearance differed, the fundamental principle behind this fusion was similar to the slimes’ transformation, where they would fuse with other slimes and be reborn as a high ranked slime.\n[Don’t come...]\n[I’ll kill you.]\n[Don’t...]\n[Come!]\nLee Shin Woo had experience hunting a level 6 elite, the Corps Commander Vitas. However, Vitas was a magician, as well as a commander, and he had even been distracted by the magic cast by a level 6 hero.\nHowever, this foe was only aiming for them, was incomparably larger than Vitas, and possessed a special ability!\n[I’ll kill you!]\n\"Shin Woo, it’s poison...!\"\nThe golem, which was essentially one huge tree, shook its body, spewing out an overly deep concentration of black poison mist that instantaneously covered the entire area. Lee Shin Woo comforted Jin, who was watching with an uneasy expression, with a calm voice.\n\"Our connection. Don’t forget.\"\n\"Hoo, heup...!\"\nThe mist covered an extensive area, so it was impossible to escape it. As a matter of fact, doing so would essentially be giving up on the fight. He no longer possessed the Avenger skill anymore, so he didn’t need to run away and come back anymore.\n[You are being affected by High Rank Acid Poison Mist! Intermediate Acid Resistance is reducing the damage by about 50%!]\nIt was as Lee Shin Woo had expected. The Tree Golem, which resulted from merging the energy of the forest into one being, could spew out High Rank Acid Poison! If he hadn’t equipped armor specializing in acid, he and Jin would’ve been a handful of bone powder by now!\n\"Mm. Surprisingly... I can take this much.\"\nLee Shin Woo watched as the Acid Poison spewed by the enormous golem quickly began melting the surface of his armor. If he had activated Regeneration a bit slower, his ribs would’ve been melted away as well, but Regeneration and Acid Resistance worked well together, so he could endure. No, he could actually...\n\"Please say it ain’t so. Please. You’re not doing what I think you are, right?\"\nJin knew exactly what Lee Shin Woo was going to do and spoke with a quivering voice. He was also enduring as Lee Shin Woo shared his Acid Resistance with him, but if he lost that Acid Resistance for even an instant, he figured that his leg would get melted away; so he was slightly afraid.\nThough Lee Shin Woo, who was maintaining his connection with Jin, could understand how he was feeling, he ultimately spoke like this.\n\"Now that we’re here, why don’t we level up our resistance to high rank before we go?\"\n\"Please no.\"\n\"We need to analyze it to figure out how it attacks; our analysis might take a little bit longer, though.\"\n\"Ah, I thought as much...\"\nMaybe this was Lee Shin Woo’s intent from the start. The moment he could no longer properly train his resistance with the ordinary trees, he made up his mind to train his resistance through the boss monster!\nJin realized that there was already no turning back, and when he resigned himself, Lee Shin Woo said something meaningless.\n\"You have to start concentrating. We need to thoroughly analyze its techniques and attack patterns.\"\n\"You mean while we endure all the Acid Poison, right?\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nHe was saying that he’d train his Acid Resistance while scouting out the boss. Even at this very moment, the Tree Golem stretched out its wooden arm and attacked; at the same time, it violently spewed out its High Rank Acid Poison!\n[You have being affected by High Rank Acid Poison Mist! The mana in the entire area is contaminated by acid!]\n\"Heup.\"\nA high rank didn’t just mean it was powerful; there was also the contamination of mana! At this level, the Acid Poison covered the entire area, contaminating the air, mana, and everything else! Even though Lee Shin Woo and Jin didn’t need to breathe, as they were undead, they naturally absorbed mana, but by doing so, they would instead absorb acid into their bodies.\n\"Damn it. I’m not taking any damage because of my resistance, but when I filter all the acid out, I don’t have much mana left...!\"\n\"I guess this is how an enemy possessing the ability to use a high rank element fights. It completely controls the area by changing it to its own element and prevents its enemy from moving; ultimately, it’s not much different from a game of Go.\"\nBut even as he said this, Lee Shin Woo sported a smile. Comparing it to Go was only applicable when both players’ pieces were different colors. Unfortunately, Lee Shin Woo possessed intermediate level 8 Acid Resistance!\n\"Jin, tell me when you’re running low on mana. I’ll give you mana when you need it.\"\n\"Are you ok!?\"\n\"Yeah, I have plenty of mana.\"\nHe was indeed overflowing with mana. Lee Shin Woo had more mana now than when he started the battle. It didn’t matter whether the surrounding mana had been contaminated by acid or not. He would draw in both acid and mana through his intermediate level 6 Mana Bone!\n’You can change mana into acid, so it isn’t very difficult to do the reverse. This situation... is actually in my favor.’\nIt might’ve been different had it been High Rank Acid Poison, but he didn’t sustain any damage from mana mixed with a lower concentration of acid, and was able to transform the acid into mana. It felt like his Acid Resistance, Acid element, as well as his mana were undergoing training right now.\n\"Hooo... Nice, my mana’s rising.\"\nLee Shin Woo felt his Acid Resistance and Acid element growing sharply and his jawbone rattled in satisfaction. Whenever the golem spewed out the mist, he felt like his Acid element grew slightly... it really wasn’t so bad.\n\"Moreover, I may not know what it’s protecting, but it’s not moving from its spot. It may not have been so easy if we had gone in and recklessly attacked, but it should be an easy win if all we have to do is dodge and defend.\"\n\"It’s not easy, you know? My body’s already melting away, so it feels like I’m dying!\"\n\"Keep it up. Another branch is coming!\"\n\"Ahhhhhhhhh!\"\nAs Lee Shin Woo said, the golem acted like it was desperately defending something, even though there was nothing remaining in the forest; it firmly remained in that spot, guarding it with its life, spewing acid and stretching out its branches.\nIf it had started to move, Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t have had any other choice but to respond more aggressively. However, he didn’t need to evade or block its Acid Poison, and as long as he dodged its extending arms, he didn’t really have anything to worry about.\n[Stop hurting the forest!]\n\"Don’t worry. There’s no forest to hurt anymore!\"\n[Gguaaaaaaaaaahk!]\nHundreds of thick tree branches shot out from the golem’s body and stretched like whips towards Lee Shin Woo and Jin. Each branch possessed a frightening amount of force, as it was a level 6 elite. The rıghtful source is novel(ꜰ)ire.net\n[Critical hit!]\nHowever, before those branches could skewer them, a rotating Melting Bone Double Axe in the air swooped down and cut past the branches. Dozens of branches broke with a cracking sound, fell to the ground, and emitted Acid Poison before vanishing.\n[Kuaaaaahk!]\n\"It’s not over yet!\"\nThen, two more axes swooped down and violently cut through the branches. The sight of the axes, reinforced by Rule of Bone, going into flight formation and cleaving through the branches was truly magnificent. Not a single branch could come close to Lee Shin Woo or Jin.\nThat’s right. Only Lee Shin Woo was able to protect himself with this ’expanded defense zone’ as the axes followed his will, the one who possessed Rule of Bone! He could cover a certain range with these axes and anything that came within that range would be destroyed!\n\"You dumbass! You should be shooting those tentacles at someone else, not me!\"\n[Kuaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\nAs soon as he perfectly guarded against the attack, the infuriated golem’s branches burst forth, but Lee Shin Woo calmly controlled his axes and blocked them as well.\nIt would’ve been a bit harder if it had attacked him from all sides, but because it consolidated its attack, it was even easier to guard against!\n[Die! Dieeeeeee!]\n\"Tch... Heup!\"\nBecause it was a level 6 elite monster, there was quite a hefty weight behind each and every branch, but because he had prepared for this moment by training his Rule of Bone skill, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t pushed back the whole time. If there was something he couldn’t cut through with one axe, then two or three axes attacking simultaneously should do it!\n\"I’m a lot different from when I fought Vitas! To be precise, my stats have increased by about 1,200 since then!\"\n[Don’t comeeeeeeeeee!]\nWhenever a branch shot out, Lee Shin Woo’s axe would block it, so the golem started rampaging about. Because of that, the Acid Poison that it was spewing intensified as well. That was exactly what Lee Shin Woo was hoping for.\n\"If I play my cards right, my skill should level up within a day.\"\n\"You’re saying that I have to avoid this awful bastard for an entire day...\"\nJin had a hunch that what Lee Shin Woo was waiting for had finally come. Now he had no choice but to die. There were several moments until now where he felt like he would die, but this time, he’d die 100%. He would just ’hang out’ with a level 6 elite monster for an entire day? It was finally his time to die.\nBut at the very least, it was a relief that his Blessing of Death’s revival ability had increased to three as he had gone around and fought several high leveled enemies (in other words, enemies deeply affected by the curse) with Lee Shin Woo.\n\"It’s alright. We can do it. It’s not much different from the rest of our fights in the forest... Uhmp.\"\n[Kyahaaahk!]\nMeanwhile, had the Tree Golem figured out Lee Shin Woo’s abilities? All of a sudden, the Tree Golem’s tree branches became tougher. To be exact, the branches entangled with other branches, taking the form of a twisted bread stick; it had begun shooting out the dried branches. He couldn’t take care of those branches with just the axes he controlled from afar, so he had to move his body.\n\"Shin Woo, won’t it come at us with a huge attack at this rate?\"\n\"No, it shouldn’t. This is probably the best it can do... Heup!\"\n’Well, as long as we don’t get any closer that is.’\nAs they were barely out of range, the tree couldn’t attack them personally by swinging its arms and legs. The golem would never attack them personally and just attacked them with its Acid Poison and by extending its branches.\nThey would have to get closer to take down the main body, but Lee Shin Woo still needed to train his Acid Resistance, so there was no way he’d do that. Right now he was worried that cutting the branches would weaken its poison!\n[Don’t come... Don’t comeeeeeeeeeeeeee!]\nEven when it changed its tactics, Lee Shin Woo didn’t die and the golem spread its acid as its temper flared even more. The Dryads, which the golem had absorbed, shrieked with the voices of old women that struck Lee Shin Woo and Jin like a curse. However, Lee Shin Woo and Jin possessed the ability to ignore the curse, so they didn’t cower in the least!\n\"Man, what the hell are you even protecting? You’re really pissing me off...!\"\n\"I think I know what they’re protecting now.\"\nLee Shin Woo swung his axe once more, cleared the branches, and laughed. If what they were so desperately protecting couldn’t be seen above ground, then there was only one answer there.\n\"There’s a space under its feet.\"\nAnd the space under its feet was probably a dungeon. They went so far as to be corrupted to protect it... he really wanted to figure out what it was immediately, but was prudent. Right now, training his Acid Resistance took priority.\n[Dieeeeeeeeeeeeee!]\nThe Tree Golem wailed. Lee Shin Woo tightly gripped the axe, and his goblin fire blazed.\nThe lengthy battle had just begun.",

    "content": "<Chapter 20. Forest of the Dryads - 6>\n[Lloyd H.K.: It was huge. Its mana was tremendous as well. I could feel how powerful it was, even though it was so far away.]\n[Prince Altania: Isn’t it just a big creature? I think I could take it...]\n[Yasunori Akira: Why don’t you go over there then? I would’ve gone myself if I was nearby. Oh well.]\nIt’d truly been a long time since the other heroes had entered the chatting channel and they were excited in a different way. After Shino Rendu died, the channel had become stagnant, but because they’d discovered a new elite monster, they were all starting to come back.\n[Lee Shin Woo: Is the monster so powerful that even you (seniors) wouldn’t dare face it?]\nLee Shin Woo leisurely cut that powerful monster’s outstretched branches, and spoke in the channel. He’d fought the Tree Golem for a few days now and had become bored, so he entered the chatting channel to increase the effectiveness of his training!\n[Erian Ruparte: We don’t know. Since we haven’t gotten close and personally ascertained its level. However, if it truly was created in the ’Melting Forest’, one of the renowned areas of the Empire...]\n[Ethan Cruz: Oh my god. You’re talking about that forest in the northwestern outskirts of the Empire, right? Once you enter, you’re helpless as your gear starts to melt right away, and let’s not talk about your body.]\n[Prince Altania: Heng, a forest? Then it’s simple. I just need to use my special fire magic from afar and burn it to a crisp!]\nPrince acted conceitedly and Erian snorted.\n[Erian Ruparte: Unfortunately for you, Sir Altania, I believe there’s a strange energy protecting the forest. You would likely be unable to burn a single tree before you completely remove that energy.]\n[Prince Altania: What? A stronger force can overcome a weaker force.]\n[Erian Ruparte: What I’m saying is that it’d be difficult for you, Sir Altania, as there’s quite a bit of that energy there.]\n[Prince Altania: Ugh...] ᴛhis chapter is ᴜpdated by novel★fire.net\n[Lee Shin Woo: What do you mean by a strange energy...?]\nShe was definitely talking about the Dryads, but Lee Shin Woo feigned ignorance! It had the feeling of ’oh, there’s a place like that? I wouldn’t even dare going there!’, so Erian replied satisfyingly.\n[Erian Ruparte: I believe they’re corrupted spirits. They were called Dryads in my world. If they’re really Dryads, then... it’s truly miserable and depressing. Dryads treasure trees, and love anything that is alive...]\n\"So what you’re saying is...\"\n[Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\nAt that moment, it seemed like the golem couldn’t take any more of this slow paced battle, and wailed loudly. Thousands of tree branches rose into the air and fused into one! That completed giant tree hammer fell upon them like an arrow. Jin was startled, moved his body, and evaded it.\nBut then, the hammer impacted the ground with a ’kwang!’; following that, the hammer transformed into an immense concentration of Acid Poison and thickly spread everywhere. That powerful acid, which looked like it would melt any type of equipment like Ethan Cruz had said, covered Lee Shin Woo and Jin simultaneously.\n[You are being affected by the High Rank Acid Hammer! Intermediate Acid Resistance reduces the damage by about 60%!]\n\"Kuhek... I really want to stop doing this! I did enough... Shin Woo, we can stop now, right? Right?\"\n\"Bear with it a bit more, Jin. We can’t stop now!\"\nIt was only for a instant, but Lee Shin Woo’s armor was completely melted away, as well as half of his arms and legs. It was the same for Jin as well. Although he possessed intermediate level 9 resistance, he couldn’t avoid taking a significant amount of damage from the poison; that was the golem’s power.\n\"I can’t, I’ll die. I’ll really die. See you later, Shin Woo...\"\n\"You won’t die. Don’t worry.\"\nAnd it went exactly as Lee Shin Woo said. His hastily activated Regeneration skill restored not only his own body, but Jin’s melting body as well. Of course, this was all due to his Assimilation skill, which had grown to intermediate level 5!\n[Erian Ruparte: That acid is much too powerful for us to endure, and will not only melt through metal, but our bodies as well. Even if you can use magic well, you’d have to sacrifice both your skin and muscles to block it. You must not recklessly approach the forest.]\n[Yasunori Akira: Haha, it certainly is interesting, but you can’t throw away your life just because you’re curious.]\nWhile his seniors laughed with a ’haha’ or ’hoho’, and forbade entrance to the ’Melting Forest’, Lee Shin Woo completely healed his body. Jin, who was unable to finish this fight, sighed and asked Lee Shin Woo.\n\"...What level is your Regeneration skill?\"\n\"Intermediate level 7.\"\n\"It leveled up by 5 levels!\"\n\"Well, we’ve both been melted so many times...\"\nSince he could absorb a portion of the acid as mana, he was overflowing with mana. He used all of that mana for Regeneration, and after repeatedly using it on himself and Jin, his skill grew quickly.\nSkills always grew quickly in extreme situations, and objectively assessing the situation the two were in would result in something like this: ’they’re fighting a seemingly unbeatable foe and have miraculously endured for three whole days’!\n[Erian Ruparte: I don’t know how that monster was created, but the only thing we can do is either wait for it to calm down, or... wait for it to leave the forest.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Lee Shin Woo, weren’t you around there? Are you ok?]\n[Lee Shin Woo: I’m ok since I took Senior Erian’s words to heart and went in the opposite direction. However, even I can see its head from where I am. It’s quite frightening.]\n[Yasunori Akira: ...Don’t overdo it, Lee Shin Woo. Since you’re growing rapidly, even now. You said you passed 2,500 stats?]\n[Prince Altania: You monster. I have to get to level 7 before you catch up.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: You’re west, right? Are you finding any dungeons?]\n[Prince Altania: Ah, don’t know. Stop acting like you’re concerned about me and enjoy dating that granny elf!]\n[Erian Ruparte: Granny? Granny!? What did you say Sir Altania!?]\nAh, the chatting channel is filled with lies! Lee Shin Woo would feel bad if he lied anymore, so Lee Shin Woo stopped listening to his seniors and left the chatting channel. Over the past three days, the Tree Golem’s body had shrunk significantly, so he could see it all with a single glance.\n’I’ve been continuously cutting the branches, so it’s been shrinking.’\nBut no matter how many branches he cut, the mana in its main body wouldn’t diminish, and the smaller its body became, the sharper and tougher its branches became.\nLee Shin Woo had given up on cutting all the branches, and was in the middle of picking out its weakest branches and cutting them with his three axes, but perhaps that wouldn’t even be possible soon.\n’If that happens, then I’ll really have to take down the main body.’\nSince they’d been fighting the Tree Golem for three days already, Lee Shin Woo already knew all of its special characteristics. He was also aware of the difference in stats between them. Lee Shin Woo and Jin’s teamwork was good enough to overcome that stat differential. It filled in all the gaps that the Rebellion skill couldn’t cover.\nTherefore, he wouldn’t hesitate when his resistance went up to the high rank level. He would cleave through its body and burn it to a crisp! Lee Shin Woo inwardly made that decision. However, a problem occurred before he could make that happen.\n[Ah... Ah.]\n\"Hmm?\"\nHe cut the golem’s fired branches with his flawless axe technique, and absorbed as much of the spewed acid as he could; then, Lee Shin Woo heard something that made him flinch. He thought it might be an illusion, but it wasn’t.\n[How is this... possible?]\n\"Huh!?\"\nIn the center of the Tree Golem’s body, where countless screams had been emitted, one of the voices suddenly changed to that of a young girl’s. Was that all? A portion of the branches coming towards them stopped midair as well! Lee Shin Woo realized this and stood in shock; the small, but distinct girl’s voice continued.\n[Ah. In the end... In the end, we became like this...]\n[Gguaaaaaaaaahk!]\n[Don’t come!]\n[Die...! Please die...!]\nHer refreshing voice was accompanied by the other old womens’ voices, which actually made the mood even gloomier! Lee Shin Woo cleared the branches flying towards him and yelled.\n\"Have you gotten a hold of yourself now?\"\n’He’s actually acting like someone whose original plan was to awaken the Dryads!’\nHe was always ready to act anywhere and anytime depending on the situation at hand, which was why he could respond so quickly. Because he acted so naturally, the Dryad didn’t find him suspicious and replied.\n[I remember everything. You didn’t attack us ever since entering the forest. In the end, you protected us, even going so far as to risk your life...!]\n\"I just couldn’t harm you Dryads, the protectors of this forest! I didn’t have a good way of saving you, and I was just being foolish...!\"\n\"Bleh.\"\nJin retched at Lee Shin Woo’s despicable acting. Even while doing so, he skillfully avoided the branches that came flying at them. He’d become skilled enough that he could dodge them in his sleep.\n[That mysterious ability of yours to absorb the curse... I see. It’s because of that ability of yours that I’m briefly able to regain my sanity... It must be because of that ability that you’re able to remain sane even after becoming a skeleton.]\n\"Yeah, you’re right.\"\nSo this all happened because of Jin’s ability to absorb the curse! Lee Shin Woo acted calm and replied, but was actually astonished on the inside. Then again, they had fought the same opponent for three whole days while Jin remained in contact with the nearby mana the entire time, so it wasn’t very strange that they made this new discovery.\nHe needed to look into this more in the future. He thought it was just a skill that revived him, but this was proof that there was something more tremendous that lay hidden within Jin’s skill.\n[Thank you for your efforts and sincerity. However, it’s much too late now. I didn’t think we’d be corrupted to this extent...]\n\"...\"\n[I have a shameless request for you, who risked your life to protect us Dryads. Could you please listen to my request?\nRight after regaining her sanity, she had a request? It must be considerably urgent. If not, then she must deeply trust Lee Shin Woo, as he was the one who ’protected’ them. Either way, this was the result of Lee Shin Woo’s Acting skill.\n[Is it... too much?]\n\"...No, go ahead.\"\nLee Shin Woo felt slightly conflicted, but ultimately nodded his head. Then, the Dryad spoke happily, as if she knew he would do that.\n[Please seek out the General, Dana Von Etliber. She should be safe from all of this, as she’s loved by countless spirits. Please tell her where we are... and please give her this.]\nSuddenly, something shot out of the golem’s torso and fell before Lee Shin Woo. Lee Shin Woo cut through the branches without much difficulty and picked it up. It was a crystal radiating a pale green light.\n[Spirit’s Spring Key Fragment]\n[A precious artifact made of pure mana that is only given to the world’s spirits. It can only be given to someone approved of by a spirit, and is also a token of friendship. Using this and a few other materials, you can open a passageway that allows you to enter the spirit’s spring.]\n\"This is...\"\n[You just need to give that to her. As soon as possible... If you do that, she’ll take care of everything. And with that, our kind will somehow...]\nShe spoke with a lighthearted voice, as if she had just let go of a heavy burden. The Dryad wouldn’t have imagined that Lee Shin Woo could see the crystal’s information as he was a hero.\n[Please go find her. Hurry! There’s no hope for us. I’ll lose my sanity soon; please run while I can still maintain control over this golem! Run away and give Dana Von Etliber...!]\n\"Hey. Hey!\"\nLee Shin Woo called the Dryad with a sincere and refined voice akin to a Skeleton Knight’s, but she couldn’t respond, as she used the rest of her energy into stopping the golem! At that moment, he thought it might, but the Acting skill did indeed level up.\n[The Acting skill has become Lv13! Who are you an ally to, and who are you an enemy to? Perhaps you yourself do not know the difference anymore.]\n’Shin Woo, what do we do?’\nJin used his connection through Lee Shin Woo’s Assimilation skill to speak. Lee Shin Woo replied seriously.\n’Let’s act like we can’t run away and take it down. She’s trying to not tell us anything.’\n’Yeah, you really are the worst.’\n’Can’t you just call me the winner of our battle of wits?’\nThey acted as though the Acid Poison prevented them from escaping; ultimately, the Dryad wailed, telling them to run away, and lost consciousness.\nHe worried that the crystal she’d given him would disappear as well, but after confirming that it was safe, Lee Shin Woo smiled in satisfaction and raised his axe once more.\n\"Then, shall we begin training again!?\"\n\"Let’s give it a rest, you demon...\"\nJin weakly replied, yet moved as Lee Shin Woo wished. Truthfully, he didn’t want to finish off the golem yet either! There was still some time before their battle with the golem came to a close.",

    "content": "<Chapter 20. Forest of the Dryads - 7>\n\"Why...\"\nLee Shin Woo muttered in despair. Two more days had passed since he’d acquired the Spirit’s Spring Key Fragment from the Dryad.\n\"Why isn’t my resistance leveling up...!? I’m almost there!\"\n\"I suppose not everyone can get a high rank skill.\"\nJin replied, uninterested. He was evading the golem’s fists and feet from up close, and it was for no other reason but to be exposed to a higher concentration of Acid Poison. He went through all this painstaking effort to train his resistance.\n[Gguaaaaaaaaaaah!]\n\"Shin Woo, accept reality. That guy’s at his limit too.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Shin Woo raised his head at Jin’s words and examined the golem. At the beginning, the golem was so massive that it seemed to reach up into the heavens, but now, it had shrunk to a mere 5 meters. It was only natural, as he’d cut so many of its branches.\n\"It seems like it can’t even replenish its mana that well anymore. The concentration of its Acid Poison seems to be lessening, and its attacks are gradually getting weaker.\"\n\"...Damn it. It must be at its limits if you can sense it too.\"\nAs they fought against the golem, Lee Shin Woo and Jin’s dramatic growth that came about due to the intense situation. Their skills made the battle feel much easier than it should’ve been, but they had to face the facts. Lee Shin Woo bitterly agreed and tightly gripped his axe.\n\"It’s time to let it go, right?\" Updates are released by Novᴇl_Fire(.)net\n\"Yeah. We have to let it go. We can finish it now...\"\n[Gguhaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!]\nThe golem wailed with superb timing. What was the golem trying to convey? Was it a wail of misery? It was the boss of the Melting Forest, an area which even level 8 heroes were afraid of, yet it had been used to lower level heroes.\nIf not, then was it weeping, as it was regretting asking such a wicked skeleton to fulfill its request? Honestly, he didn’t really care.\n\"Hoo... Alright. Let’s widen the distance a bit. Let’s go with the big gun.\"\n\"Ok.\"\nThey’d scuffled with the golem for about 5 days now, and Lee Shin Woo didn’t just swing his axe and talk in the chatting channel during that time. No way. He’d figured out the golem’s characteristics, as well as its skill pattern, which used mana. Therefore, Lee Shin Woo had run a few simulations on how to kill it the best way.\nLee Shin Woo had spoken to Jin several times, and created a move that would kill the Tree Golem. But in order to execute that move, they would need to widen the distance; it seemed as though the golem misunderstood their intent.\n[T-They’re leaving!]\nAs soon as Lee Shin Woo and Jin widened the distance, the golem yelled as if to cheer. They didn’t even spew their Acid Poison and just saw them off. However, Lee Shin Woo left them a present, as if responding to them.\nThat present was the three Melting Double Bone Axes that remained in the air for the past 5 days. Surprisingly, the three axes contained the maximum amount of magic they could hold within them. If he combined the three, they would easily surpass Lee Shin Woo’s maximum magic!\n’The fact that Rule of Bone and Bone Armory grew might just be the best thing I got from this battle.’\nAs he fought the Tree Golems, he hadn’t just gained mere skill level ups; he’d learned ways in which he could better use these skills.\nJust a little while ago, he hadn’t thought of separately infusing mana into equipment he’d summoned and controlled through Bone Armory. He would either shift his mana to the weapons to increase their power, or simply use the skill.\n’But because of Rule of Bone, I’ve figured out a way to maintain the mana I’ve imbued the faraway weapons with.’\nNormally, there’s a limit to how much mana he can store in his body at one time. That was Mana Bone’s limit. That limit has steadily increased with his level ups, his skill level, as well as his magic stat. But ultimately, he had a level 5’s mana capacity.\n\"Shin Woo, right about here, right?\"\n\"Yeah. My weapon’s are on standby too!\"\n[Gguaaaaaaaah!]\nBut as soon as he was able to store his mana into the equipment summoned through Bone Armory, as well as maintain that mana, he was essentially able to increase his maximum mana capacity.\nBy shifting his mana to his equipment, his body’s own mana supply would be empty. However, as he replenished his mana, the mana contained within his equipment wouldn’t diminish. Ultimately, if he were to replenish his mana, Lee Shin Woo could control more mana than before: his own supply, as well as what was contained within his equipment!\nHe infused his mana into his axes in the moments he could spare whilst fighting the golem. Thus, his three axes were filled to the brim with mana (Lee Shin Woo decided to call this ’fully charged’).\n\"We’re far enough, right?\"\n\"Yep. I’m changing my weapon to the Drake Horn Lance... then let’s get started! Twin Horn Charge!\"\n\"You got it!\"\nHe switched to the Drake Horn Lance and took a charging stance. The moment Lee Shin Woo gave the signal, Jin kicked off the floor and began sprinting at an explosive speed!\n[Kuwaaaaaaaah!]\nThe golem was scuffling with the axes that Lee Shin Woo had left behind, and once it realized that Lee Shin Woo was approaching once more, it screamed and attempted to spew its Acid Poison again. But with just that much, it wouldn’t be able to even slow them down by 0.001 seconds.\n\"One!\"\nWith his command, one of the axes in the air exploded spectacularly!\nHe didn’t have high expectations for its acid damage, but the force of the explosion, as well as the shrapnel were enough to confuse the golem.\n\"Two!\"\n[Gguaaaaaaahk!]\nFollowing that, the second axe exploded! Its outstretched branches were broken apart, and due to the force of the explosion, the golem, or to be more specific, the Corrupted Dryads which controlled it, screamed awfully.\nBecause it was weakened from the battle of attrition over the last 5 days, it sustained considerable damage from the fully charged Melting Bone Double Axes.\n\"Shin Woo! We’re about to crash into him!\"\n\"We need to get a little closer...!\"\nThe first two explosions were nothing more than a guidance system for the last axe to explode as smoothly as possible.\nLee Shin Woo had thoroughly analyzed the Tree Golem’s weakness, its center; its center was where the Dryads’ wills, as well as the golem’s mana were controlled! At the beginning, the Dryads waited in the center of the forest, and when faced with Lee Shin Woo and Jin, created the Tree Golem, burrowing themselves deep into its chest.\nThat was the Tree Golem’s sole weakness.\n\"Alright, now!\"\nOrdinarily, the Tree Golem would always protect its chest, but it panicked due to the two continuous explosions, exposing its chest to the sky. That was exactly what Lee Shin Woo was waiting for.\n[Critical Hit!]\nThe axe flew through the tree and bone pieces, then precisely burrowed into its chest and exploded!\n[Gguaaaaaaaaaah!]\nThe Dryads’ scream was the most shocking and hair-raising scream he’d heard yet. But despite that, it still remained standing. The bark covering the center of the golem was the toughest, as it was its weak spot.\nThe impact removed the bark, but its core was still intact. Indeed, its bark had been removed.\n\"Jin!\"\n\"Heuaat!\"\nLee Shin Woo and Jin hurriedly seized the opportunity that resulted from the three continuous explosions, and Jin, who’d gotten close, leapt with all the speed he’d built up! He couldn’t have even dreamed of doing so before, but it was possible for him now that he had the Steel heart skill.\n\"Heup!\"\nLee Shin Woo had aimed his lance at the Golem’s center ever since Jin started running, without even shaking it once. The outer bark was removed, revealing the black inner flesh, as well as the Corrupted Dryads within.\n’Rising...’\nThe Drake Horn Lance’s red energy mixed with the Bursting Thunder dark blue sparks to form a violet light. He wanted to add the Twin Horn Charge to the tip of the lance as well, but he hadn’t trained it enough yet. However, this should be enough.\n’Thunder!’\nIt was such an embarrassing name that Lee Shin Woo inwardly muttered the technique name, and forcefully thrust his lance. The violet sparks rushing towards the tip of the lance was truly magnificent.\n[Kuoooooooooh!]\nAt the last moment, the golem twisted its body and attempted to dodge his attack, but... Lee Shin Woo had already let go of the lance, and with its explosive speed, burrowed deep within the golem’s center before it could even react!\n[Critical Hit!]\nLee Shin Woo planned to explode the lance if that didn’t work, but unfortunately, he didn’t need to do so.\nThe lance had burrowed deep into the golem’s center, and immediately after the electric discharge, as well as a reverberating scream, the golem just stopped.\n\"...Is it over?\"\n\"It’s a pain, so don’t try to revive it.\"\nJin muttered, and Lee Shin Woo scolded him; immediately after, the golem turned into mana particles, dispersing everywhere, and completely disappeared.\nAt the same time, Lee Shin Woo, who was free falling with Jin, got a message informing them of their victory.\n[You fought against a high leveled foe, and after tirelessly enduring for several days, achieved the feat of finding its weakness and taking advantage of it. All stats have increased by 3! Proficiency in the Bursting Thunder skill has increased!]\n[You have acquired the Adventurer’s karma token. Agility and Health have increased by 5. It is absorbed by the Joker karma.]\n\"Oh.\"\nIt’d been quite a long time since he’d acquired a new karma! It seemed like enduring for several days against a high leveled elite monster were points in his favor. Maybe he might get something even better if he were to endure for even longer!\nWhile thinking that Jin would pale in fear if he told him about this, they landed. The Perium and loot from the Corrupted Tree Golem fell from the sky.\n[You have acquired 395,070 Perium.]\n[You have acquired a Lv5 Dryad’s Bow. Through Bone Reinforcement, it has changed into the Lv4 Unchanging Bone Bow (+5).]\n[You have acquired a Spirit Stone containing the corrupted power of the Dryads.]\n[You have acquired an Unmelting Bone Root.]\n\"Kek, ooh...\"\nLee Shin Woo had been having a lot of success with Bone reinforcement lately, but when the level 5 artifact was degraded into a level 4 artifact, he felt truly thrilled. Now that he thought about it, it wouldn’t always change for the better!\nOn the other hand, the Spirit Stone containing the Dryads’ power was radiating a murky, rusty color, perhaps due to being corrupted, and was simply a mass of mana that even Bone Reinforcement couldn’t do anything about. He didn’t really know what to do with this, and decided to put it into his inventory for now.\n\"And...\"\nThe final piece of loot, the Unmelting Bone Root looked like an item that seemed better geared towards Acid than the other Melting Bone Roots he’d gotten from the other Acid Great Trees.\nWhenever he absorbed a Melting Bone Root, he was inwardly disappointed as they would increase his Acid element rather than his Acid Resistance, but this...\n\"Nice. Bone Reinforcement!\"\nLee Shin Woo had a strong feeling about this and used Bone Reinforcement without delay. Contrary to its title, the Unmelting Bone Root possessed a powerful mana and Acid element within that was transferred in its entirety to Lee Shin Woo!\n[Executing Bone Reinforcement by consuming the Unmelting Bone Root. Health and Magic have increased by 10. Absorbing a portion of the Corrupted Tree Golem’s experiences and memories.]\nThe high physical strength of these trees that made up this forest as well as their powerful mana... as well as...\n[The Intermediate Acid Resistance skill has become Lv10 and has evolved into the high rank level! Magic has increased by 20. You take almost no damage from acid.]\n[You have achieved the feat of acquiring a high rank skill! All stats have increased by 10!]\nHe didn’t even really need to check his messages. The moment he felt a definite change on the inside, albeit a small one, Lee Shin Woo smiled (that impression). He had achieved his primary objective of coming to this forest.",

    "content": "<Chapter 21. Inherited Hope - 1>\n\"Now, shall we go find out what the Dryads were hiding?\"\n\"You know, I don’t hate that part of you; that fickle side of yours.\"\n\"Thanks. I like that part of myself too.\"\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo fulfilled his objective of raising his Acid Resistance to the high rank level, which was something he seemed willing to stake his life on before, he decided on a new goal. He spent only 3 minutes at best reveling in his accomplishment.\n\"I wonder what the Dryads wanted from the Spirit General?\"\n\"They wanted us to tell her about this place, so the answer’s probably inside somewhere. It’s easy to find, too.\"\nLee Shin Woo began searching and quickly found the secret the Dryads had left behind... in other words, the entrance to a dungeon. Even though he was watching Lee Shin Woo’s every move, Jin didn’t understand why Lee Shin Woo was so sure.\n\"The traces the golem left behind are too thick, so I can’t really tell.\"\n\"But it’s a lot easier to sense than the winery? If you can grasp the Dryads’ mana, then it should be easy to find.\"\nThere was an even easier way: find the ground that wasn’t very damaged, despite the fierce battle! Lee Shin Woo suddenly drew his mana at the place the golem was guarded. With just that, the ground softly vibrated and dirt stairs appeared leading down.\n[Level 5 dungeon - You have acquired the permit for Mellonia’s Laboratory. All stats increase by 10 within the dungeon. The dungeon’s information is added to your minimap. All actions are buffed within the dungeon.]\nThere was no way of knowing who Mellonia was, but he was sure that the Dryads were using this facility differently than the way it was intended upon creation.\nBecause the entrance was so tiny, they (especially the large Jin) had to hunch their shoulders to enter the dungeon. Soon, the entrance closed, and hundreds of stairs appeared. It was a relief that it was wide enough for Jin to go down.\n\"Hoo, we’ll reach the bottom soon.\"\n\"It’s too quiet...\"\n\"No, there’s breathing. You can tell if you sense the mana.\"\n[!?]\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo spoke decisively, he felt something recoiling in fear from within the darkness of the dungeon. He chuckled, and stepped onto the floor at the end of the stairs.\nHowever, before they went deeper into the darkness, they heard a voice which caused them to stop.\n[Who... Who are you!?]\nIt was a pure and young lady’s voice... It was different from a human’s voice, as it had a peculiar echo to it, and contained magic in it as well. Lee Shin Woo suddenly realized that this was an uncorrupted Dryad’s voice.\n’As expected, the thing that the Corrupted Dryads wanted to protect the most above all were the Dryads who weren’t corrupted...’\nThat was the moment that their hidden ’treasure’ was revealed. It was obvious when he thought about it. The Corrupted Dryads’ appearance had been so shocking that Lee Shin Woo had erroneously assumed that there weren’t any normal Dryads left.\n’If that’s the case, then what the Corrupted Dryads wanted from the Spirit General was probably...’\nWhen he acquired the final puzzle piece, the Dryads, the answer became quite obvious. They were probably hoping that the Spirit General would protect the remaining Dryads that hadn’t been corrupted.\nGiving him the key fragment that allows passage to the Spirit Springs was also likely an extension of that as well. They probably wanted the uncorrupted Dryads to leave this dangerous world and live in the Spirit Springs instead, or something similar. Though Lee Shin Woo got in the middle of it and made everything a mess.\n’Alright, Lee Shin Woo. Calm down. If I can talk to them, then I have to give it a try.’\nJust blindly killing them all was the dumbest idea ever. There was probably something else he could get from this scarce spirit species. If that’s the case, then there was only one thing of importance: acting.\n\"I’m Paul Zero.\"\nFor Lee Shin Woo, switching to acting was easier than even breathing; he spoke in an extremely peaceful and attentive voice.\n\"I’d like to talk with you.\"\n[T-Talk...?]\n\"Yeah, talk.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s voice was extremely calm. The representative Dryad seemed to be confused, as Lee Shin Woo’s appearance didn’t match that of a high ranking skeleton at all; however, while hesitating, the other Dryads began to speak by the ones or twos.\n[A trespasser! It’s a trespasser!]\n[How can a skeleton...?]\n[How can a mere skeleton be talking with us...?]\nThe Dryads’ young, beautiful voices were pleasant to his ear, but it felt like the voices that came after the first were a bit older. Soon, the noise spread uncontrollably. Chapters fırst released on n0velfire.net\n[You idiot, don’t you feel that overflowing elemental power? He’s not a normal skeleton.]\n[Now that you mention it, you’re right. Is he an Elementalist?]\n[A skeleton’s an Elementalist?]\nThe commotion was gradually increasing! The once dark dungeon began brightening up, allowing him to see within. They were spirits that looked like beautiful women of various ages... he saw both these Dryads, as well as the trees that they were protecting.\n\"...It’s rotting.\"\n[Ugh!]\nLee Shin Woo muttered subconsciously, and one of the Dryads couldn’t help but respond. That meant he’d hit the mark! The trees within the dungeon were rotting. Naturally, that meant that those withering trees were having an effect on the Dryads as well.\n\"Mm. Hoh.\"\n[Keuk!]\n[Kuuu.]\nLee Shin Woo, who’d noticed the withered trees, looked inside the premises, and found several Dryads who looked quite old. They could feel his blazing goblin fire, and they shrank at his seemingly piercing gaze; immediately after, they became angry.\n[What have you come for, Skeleton!? You’re not much better off than we are!]\n[She’s right. You’ve come to laugh at us, haven’t you!? Even though you’re a skeleton with power over nature, you’re still a skeleton!]\nThe Dryads’ voices of resentment increased. The youngest looking Dryad (in other words, the one that seemed least corrupted) sported a fierce expression and stepped forward. This was the Dryad who had first yelled ’who are you?’.\n[We don’t want to talk with you! If you have any kind of respect, then leave before you spread the curse onto us!]\n\"Ha.\"\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo had no intention of powerlessly leaving after finding the dungeon, as well as discovering the mystery. He had two choices: either kill all of them, or fool all of them. Fortunately for them, Lee Shin Woo had decided upon the latter.\nNow then, it was time to start in earnest. Lee Shin Woo’s goblin fire blazed immensely.\n\"It seems like you’ve been infected by the curse since a long time ago. No... you guys weren’t born in the dungeon, were you? Weren’t you originally affected by the curse?\"\n[Keuk!]\nLee Shin Woo painted a perfect picture in his head. The Dryads had realized the severity of the curse which uprooted the Empire, and had pushed their uninfected kin and trees into the dungeon.\nBut the problem was with the trees. Because the tree seeds were corrupted, the Dryads inside the dungeon couldn’t avoid being cursed. They were able to prevent themselves from becoming like the Dryads on the outside, as they entered the dungeon before it was too late, but they would eventually become just like them...\n\"How is it? My assessment is spot on, right?\"\n[Keuuuuuuk!]\nThe Dryads couldn’t object. Though it wasn’t 100% accurate, they couldn’t disagree that the resulting situation was as he said.\nSeeing that, Lee Shin Woo sported a satisfied expression while Jin looked at him speechless. Then, at that moment, Lee Shin Woo, who had shut all the Dryads up, spoke, as if he were giving them medicine.\n\"I’ll help you. That’s why we came.\"\n[What...?]\nLee Shin Woo lied through his teeth, and the Dryads’ sported vacant expressions. The youngest Dryad acted as their representative and asked, her tone urgent.\n[How? Why?]\n\"Considering how you’re already asking how must mean it’s quite urgent.\"\n[Kuuuuuu...!]\nThe sight of the angry, beautiful girl stamping her feet on the ground was cute. So this is what it felt like to make fun of a little kid!\nHowever, Jin hit Lee Shin Woo’s back with his head, so Lee Shin Woo decided to just go on to the main point. Honestly, it was something he started thinking about once seeing the withered trees.\n\"I know a place filled with living trees. Also, it’s a lot safer than this place. I’ll take you there.\"\n[!?]\nAt that moment, the Dryads were seized with both shock and terror. The Dryad was so shocked that she left her mouth open. Of course, that wasn’t any different with the other Dryads.\nA place with living trees in this Empire filled with the curse! The Dryads froze, as if they couldn’t understand what he was saying, yet soon thawed out. No, they were actually seething.\n[Trees!]\n[Living trees!]\n[Filled to the brim! What kind of trees are they? How many?]\nIt seemed as though they couldn’t just leave it to one representative anymore as the Dryads all began to speak. This was the kind of response he expected from spirits that lived together with trees! With one glance, Lee Shin Woo could tell their minds were elsewhere, and he ended up just laughing.\n\"They’re grapevines. They’re hundreds of them.\"\n[Grapevines...]\n[Mm...]\n[We’re really thankful. If we look over these grapevines, they can thrive.]\n[I want to see living trees. It’s too difficult for these children to endure for much longer.]\nHe’d never heard of Dryads tending to grapevines before, so Lee Shin Woo had been somewhat doubtful, but their response was quite nice. It was likely because their situation was just that bad!\n\"You’re thinking of taking them there? To the underground orchard?\"\n\"Yeah. It’s a safe and healthy place.\"\nThere was no way it wouldn’t be healthy, as an elf had been tending to it just a short while ago. Though he’d taken most of the grapes, if the Dryads were to tend to the orchard, the grapevines should grow well and survive. Of course, it was for security reasons as well.\n[Take us there!]\n[Take me there! Please, Skeleton!]\n[When I felt your power over nature, I knew you were a good person... a good skeleton!]\nSeveral Dryads suddenly changed their attitude towards him and latched onto Lee Shin Woo! Even five year old children wouldn’t be so honest with their desires!\n[I’ll do whatever you want if you bring me there!]\n[What do you want me to do? Should I bear your child? Ah, you’re a skeleton.]\n[What would make a skeleton happy?]\n[Hurry. Tell us what you want!]\nLee Shin Woo had been preparing all sorts of lies in order to fool them, yet the Dryads acted as though they would offer him anything; seeing that, Lee Shin Woo felt a bit skeptical. But then...\n[So you just came to find us and help us? That’s too suspicious. What’s your goal here? And how did you find us?]\nThere was actually someone who still didn’t trust him! It was none other than the representative Dryad! Was her mind still clear because she wasn’t corrupted at all? It was such an obvious response that Lee Shin Woo actually felt happy.\nIt was a relief that he was able to use the lines that he’d prepared for this very moment! He unhesitatingly and firmly spoke in an honest tone.\n\"I met the Dryads on the outside that were too corrupted to be saved. They gave me a request. To help you guys before you became like them.\"\n[That’s...]\nLee Shin Woo was even twisting around their request to the Spirit General, Dana Von Etliber however he wished!\nWhen he took out the Spirit Spring Key Fragment and showed it to her, the suspicious Dryad shed a tear. No matter how suspicious she was, she was still a kid.\n[Our mothers... made that request for us...!]\n\"...You’ve done well.\"\n[Kuheuk, euuuuu...]\n[Don’t cry, Sinea...]\n[Don’t cry.]\nThe Dryad (it seemed like her name was Sinea) began to cry, and the other Dryads approached her and hugged her tightly. It was such a touching scene that Lee Shin Woo applauded, and Jin, like always, came over and rammed into his back. They were still connected through Assimilation.\n’What are you thinking?’\n’They’re just like the Pauls. Wouldn’t it become interesting if I add another variable? It’d be a much more fun result than killing them at least.’\n’...’\nLee Shin Woo replied unimportantly, and Jin had nothing else to say. Only Jin could hear Lee Shin Woo chuckling like a Joker.\n’How about it? Should we go look for other spirits too?’\nJin couldn’t offer up any suggestions. He had no idea what sort of chaos Lee Shin Woo would stir up if he found more spirits.\n\"Alright. So everyone’s accepting my offer, right?\"\n[Yeah... Yeah! Of course!]\n[Thanks, Skeleton! No, Paul Zero!]\n[Thanks a lot! You’re our savior!]\nAnd so, Lee Shin Woo had ended up saving the Dryads in the Spirit General’s stead (he didn’t even know where she was). To them, this was the best method.\nHowever, the Dryads would someday regret their choice. The fact that they hadn’t asked the price for their salvation!",

What do we do about that?]\n[Even if we travel as quickly as possible, we’ll still be affected by the curse. Ugh... I’m concerned that we might spread the curse to the healthy trees.]\nThough the concerned Dryads had been convinced to move by Lee Shin Woo, they weren’t stupid. Ultimately, they asked something that had to be addressed. However, Lee Shin Woo was sporting a relaxed expression.\n\"Don’t worry. It’s not perfect, but I have something in mind.\"\n[Really?]\n[As expected of Zero Paul! So, what’s that method?]\n\"So that’s...\"\nLee Shin Woo momentarily turned his attention to Jin. Jin, who had been observing how the situation was progressing, panicked and retreated.\n’What are you trying to do?’\n’No. I was just thinking that you could absorb the curse from them with your ability.’\nThat’s right. The reason Lee Shin Woo thought ’it’ll all work out somehow’ was because he trusted Jin. And Jin also... had a rough idea why.\n’Like when we restored the sanity of that Corrupted Dryad?’\n’Also, they’re in much better shape than the Corrupted Dryads. Can you do it?’\n’Mmmmm...’\nJin was anguished. After all, at the end of the day, his curse absorption ability was a by-product of his resistance, not the main facet. He couldn’t intentionally control his absorption ability. It wasn’t easy to tell whether or not it would be possible.\n’Even if it is possible, I can’t do it by myself. I need your help.’\n’I suppose it can’t be helped.’\nOf course, he roughly expected him to say something like that. Lee Shin Woo chuckled, approached Jin, gripped his back with one hand, and activated his Assimilation skill. Now they could extremely naturally tie both their consciousness and mana together.\n’How is it, Shin Woo?’\n’Mm, good... I can roughly tell how it works.’\n’Really!?’\nJin himself hadn’t even figured out how his ability worked, so how did Lee Shin Woo figure it out!? He suddenly felt frustrated, but that’s what it meant to be talented, so there was nothing he could do.\nLee Shin Woo more deeply analyzed the curse absorption ability... which couldn’t be considered a status or even a skill, and added.\n’Yeah. Since it’s an ability that absorbs the curse, it probably wouldn’t have any effect on those who have already become undead, but it should be able to absorb the curse from these spirits.’\n’That’s amazing.’\n’This ability is impressive. It’d be hard for me to replace the absorbed curse energy with life force, but maybe if I were to apply it in a different way...’\n’Shin Woo, you’re not forgetting what you’re supposed to be doing, are you?’\n’Tch, it can’t be helped.’\nJin’s curse absorption ability was such an innovative ability that it made Lee Shin Woo wonder why he hadn’t seriously looked into it before. Perhaps that ability would have a positive effect on Lee Shin Woo, as he could freely transform mana however he wished.\n’I’ll look into it more in depth later, but for now...’\nLee Shin Woo was now sure that it would work, and stretched his hand towards the closest Dryad.\n\"You. Could you come over here?\"\n[Sure!]\nThe Dryad obeyed doubtlessly. While the other Dryads nervously watched her, Lee Shin Woo stretched out a hand while keeping the other on Jin’s back.\n[Take care of me.]\nThe Dryad firmly grabbed his outstretched hand without question. Though the spirit’s body possessed a different composition, the sensation she conveyed from touching him felt the same as any other living being. Her hand felt extremely soft, and he felt a refreshing energy coming from somewhere; he grabbed the Dryad’s hand and Lee Shin Woo suddenly felt sad.\n’Damn it. If I were a human, I would’ve...’\n’Hey. Your thoughts are leaking out.’ Googlᴇ search n͟o͟v͟e͟l͟f͟i͟r͟e͟.net\nWhen Jin pointed that out, Lee Shin Woo became docile, and earnestly began absorbing the curse from the Dryad.\nThe curse had burrowed deep into the Dryad’s body, so it wasn’t easy to find at first, but because Lee Shin Woo was tenacious and in control of Jin’s ability, he was able to gradually, very gradually draw out the curse.\n[Oh!?]\n[What’s wrong?]\n[What’s going on?]\nThe Dryad was momentarily surprised and shouted, so the other Dryads yelled in shock. The Dryad kept holding Lee Shin Woo’s hand and yelled exuberantly.\n[The curse within me is being drawn out!]\n[How!?]\n[It seems like he has an ability that lets him draw out the curse!]\n[Is that why Paul Zero is different from the other skeletons?]\n[I thought it was strange ever since feeling his power over nature!]\nThe Dryads opinions were quite intelligent. Lee Shin Woo let their lively voices stay in the background and focused on sucking out the undead curse. She wasn’t very corrupted anyway, so Lee Shin Woo quickly pulled out the root of the issue.\n[Wow... Wow.]\nThe Dryad, feeling the curse that had caused her heart so much discomfort leave her body completely, touched her body all over while slack-jawed. Was it just him? She looked a bit younger too.\n[The curse is gone!]\n[It’s true. The curse is really gone!]\n[Thanks Paul Zero!]\nWhile the Dryads made a huge fuss, the cured Dryad stroked Lee Shin Woo’s head while holding onto him tightly. He felt her soft skin all over his body, yet his heart felt calm, like an ocean without a single wave.\n[You’re my savior!]\n\"I get it, so could you stop stroking my head? Now, you’ve seen how it works, so next! I think I can do several at once.\"\n[Waaaaah!]\n[Me first, me first!]\nAs soon as Lee Shin Woo gave the signal, the Dryads cheered and rushed towards him, as if they were waiting for that! Lee Shin Woo and Jin were suddenly buried in spirits.\n’You must love it, huh?’\n’You already know that I don’t really like it.’\nIt was such a relief that he was a skeleton that didn’t need to breathe in times like this. Lee Shin Woo calmly began to suck out the curse from the Dryads everywhere and send it over to Jin.\nJin possessed the ability to absorb the curse, not Lee Shin Woo, so Lee Shin Woo would just act as the passageway that gathered the curse. Because of that, the amount of times Jin could revive through the Blessing of Death suddenly increased.\n[I feel free!]\n[Me too!]\n[Aw. I was freed, but the trees weren’t, so I feel so sorry for them.]\nIt didn’t take much time before all of the Dryads in the clearing were cleansed of the curse.\nThey cheered, and even clapped, but also mourned for the trees that couldn’t be saved, as they were already dead. Lee Shin Woo removed his hand from Jin’s back and clapped his hands.\n\"Don’t separate yourselves from me even when you get outside! Remember that!\"\n[Yes!]\n[We’ll stick to you like glue!]\nTheir responses were reliable. Lee Shin Woo felt like he had become a teacher leading kindergarten students around.\n\"Good. Then shall we go?\"\n[Before that, Paul Zero.]\nThe Dryads’ representative, Sinea, who looked the youngest amongst the living Dryads and wasn’t corrupted at all, as well as seemingly being the highest ranked Dryad here, opened her mouth.\n[We don’t need them, but there are things inside that other people might need. You see, the belongings of the original owner of this dungeon are still there.]\n\"Ah, now that you mention it.\"\nObviously, the Dryads hadn’t made this dungeon. Lee Shin Woo had decided to put off thinking about the message he’d seen when he entered the dungeon, as it seemed like this Mellonia figure made this dungeon so that spirits could live in it as they pleased.\nBut after listening to Sinea, it seemed as though Mellonia’s belongings were still inside this dungeon. It was unexpected news for him as he had been so focused on the Dryads that he had completely forgotten about the dungeon itself.\n[We thought you might want them, so we brought them. How about it?]\n\"Mm...\"\nSinea’s green eyes brightened (if someone couldn’t tell that she was a Dryad from her green eyes, then her hair was also a light green as well) and Lee Shin Woo turned his attention to the loot she’d put on the floor.\nThere were a few gems and gold nuggets, earrings enveloped in a cold magic, and finally, books that Mellonia seemed to have personally wrote. Sinea watched as Lee Shin Woo examined the loot. She must be checking to see if he liked her present. Lee Shin Woo was indeed satisfied and replied.\n\"Thanks. They’re exactly what I wanted.\"\n[That’s a relief.]\n[Oooh!]\n[Skeletons like the same stuff humans do!]\nSinea smiled in relief and simultaneously, the Dryads behind her cheered.\nHonestly, he didn’t need gold or gems, or even earrings, as he didn’t have ears to put them on, so half of the presents were meaningless to him. However, acting as though he loved the presents was an important step in solidifying a good relationship with them. Even now, Lee Shin Woo was still acting.\n’However, her handwritten books might be useful later. Though the use would differ based on what she did as a human.’\nLee Shin Woo carefully placed the precious metals, the pile of books, and the earrings into his inventory. However, the moment his hand touched the earrings, they transformed unexpectedly.\n[The Lv6 Silver Ice Tiger’s Cold Whisker Earrings has been modified through Bone Reinforcement. You have acquired the Lv6 Silver Ice Tiger’s Canine Tooth.]\nDamn it. He only briefly touched the chilling, hair-raising earrings, yet their original shape disappeared in an instant, and in their place was only a tiny silver tooth. It was ridiculously light, and the tooth was so cold that it felt like it would freeze the air. Lee Shin Woo was dumbstruck.\n’The earrings were changed by my skill, but the form completely changed this time. Whiskers can change into teeth?’\nHe knew there was nothing more stupid than questioning how Bone Reinforcement changed the material of something, but even so, he couldn’t help but be surprised.\nWhen a piece of equipment changed in the past, it would change into another piece of equipment. But this time, an accessory was changed into bone (through Bone Reinforcement), so how could he not be surprised!?\n[What’s that?]\nIt seemed like she was equally surprised, as Sinea questioned Lee Shin Woo. Lee Shin Woo pondered for a moment, but decided to ask her honestly.\n\"It seems like it’s an Silver Ice Tiger’s tooth, but do you know what a Silver Ice Tiger is?\"\n[A Silver Ice Tiger is a spirit!]\n[A Silver Ice Tiger!? They were still alive?]\n[You idiot. They’re all dead. That’s why there’s only a tooth of them left.]\nA spirit...? Lee Shin Woo was wondering, so he asked Sinea.\n\"Was the dungeon’s original owner an Elementalist?\"\n[Yep. As I thought, fellow Elementalists can tell each other apart! She was friendly with Dryads. She let us use this space, even when she was dying.]\nLee Shin Woo decided to reflect on his previous thoughts of them occupying the dungeon without permission. To think they’d been allowed in here!\n\"Do you guys contract with Elementalists too?\"\n[No? Spirits only form contracts with Elementalists when they need mana... Mm, so basically, only the aggressive spirits form contracts. We just need trees.]\nHe didn’t understand what she was saying in the least, but he could at least understand that not all spirits form contracts with Elementalists. Perhaps the books he’d recently acquired would explain that.\nLee Shin Woo was satisfied that he had unexpectedly procured knowledge regarding a field he knew little about. He was indeed satisfied, but bones were different.\n’Bone Reinforcement!’\nLee Shin Woo soon reinforced himself with the Ice Tiger’s Canine, as the Dryads watched with great interest with their brightening eyes. The best way of knowing more about this bone was to absorb it!\n[Executing Bone Reinforcement by consuming a Silver Ice Tiger’s Canine. Strength and Magic have increased by 8. You have acquired a basic knowledge of spirits. You have learned Intermediate Ice Lv1.]\n’Mmmm...’\nLee Shin Woo thought he’d be able to acquire the Ice element sometime soon, as he possessed the Elemental Reversal ability, and because of that, he wasn’t very surprised or happy about it. What he was surprised about was the vast basic knowledge on spirits.\n’This is more like the Elementalist Mellonia’s memories than the Silver Ice Tiger’s.’\nThis clear knowledge regarding spirits or elemental techniques was like a welcome rain for him. So much so that he felt that he could’ve been an Elementalist had the curse not befallen the Empire, causing everything to die.\n[The canine is gone!]\n[No, Paul Zero absorbed it! How strange!]\n[I feel more elemental power coming from Paul Zero!]\n[How’s that possible? Can he use ice spirits as well?]\nThe Dryads were in awe. They adamantly believed that Lee Shin Woo was an Elementalist.\n\"I’m done with the Silver Ice Tiger, so let’s go.\"\n[Ok!]\n[I’m excited!]\nThat’s how the mass migration of spirits and skeleton began. Anything involving Lee Shin Woo was always like this; if another hero saw this, they wouldn’t believe their eyes.",

    "content": "<Chapter 21. Inherited Hope - 3>\n[We’re finally outside!]\n[Kek. Look at that mist; it was formed from the curse clumping together... The outside world has gotten worse.]\n[If you feel like you can’t handle it, you have to get close and grab onto Paul Zero immediately!]\n[Ahhh, we can’t even find traces of our mothers anymore...]\nThe Dryads seemed elated at first when they got outside, but they soon became depressed upon realizing how appalling the situation was, as the Underground Empire was covered in the curse.\nEven though the forest was a lot cleaner than the other areas as undead couldn’t trespass deep into the forest!\n[Eww, this wasn’t the world I was looking forward to.]\n[It’s so unfortunate. You can’t call it a world when all the living beings are dead.]\n[Is there nothing we can do for this world...?]\n[Paul Zero, let’s hurry up and go.]\nSinea spoke as the representative of the drooping Dryads. It was difficult to even say anything right now, so Lee Shin Woo silently nodded his head.\n\"Yeah. Follow me quickly.\"\n[Ok...]\n[I want to hurry and see living trees.]\n[Me too...]\nThey ran silently. As Dryads couldn’t live without trees, the strength they could exert was diminished, yet they were able to follow behind Jin who ran at full speed. He was thinking about whether he needed to slow down or not, but both Lee Shin Woo and Jin were shocked.\n[This horse is really fast!]\n[I didn’t think it’d be able to run as fast as a spirit!]\nEven depressed, they marveled at Jin’s speed. Jin didn’t show it, but it seemed like he was a bit happy. Some spirits found the conversation about Jin’s speed as their opportunity to speak, and after one or two of them began speaking, they changed the subject of their conversation to Lee Shin Woo.\n[Why is Paul Zero special?]\n[What did you do before you died?]\n\"I was just a wandering knight.\"\n[You’re an Elementalist too, right? Right?]\n\"Actually, I’m not an Elementalist.\"\n[That’s impossible!]\nLee Shin Woo explained himself to the Dryads using the Paul Zero profile he’d set up. They were in disbelief and shock when he explained that he could use the elements themselves, but they eventually came to this conclusion.\n[Is Paul Zero actually a spirit?]\n[A skeleton spirit...!]\n[How cool! I knew he didn’t feel like a stranger!]\n\"...\"\nBecause it was gradually becoming troublesome to reply, he decided to let them think what they wanted. He would’ve preferred if some undead monster appeared, but because he was moving with a force of level 5 Dryads, it seemed like the undead instinctively sensed the danger and avoided them.\nHow many hours had they run? When they were close to the vineyard, Lee Shin Woo performed a final check on the Dryads for the curse. Since it would be best if they were completely clean before entering.\n\"If you feel uneasy from the curse, come over here.\"\n[Ok. Excuse me.]\nSinea, who hadn’t been corrupted thus far, seemed like she wasn’t immune to the curse once coming outside, and as soon as she heard Lee Shin Woo, immediately approached him. But when he actually checked Sinea’s condition, he couldn’t help but be surprised.\n\"You seem pretty clean to me...\"\n[...Really? That’s a relief.]\nAs expected, ’was Sinea special amongst her people?’ Lee Shin Woo thought, as he completely sucked out what little curse she was afflicted with.\nPerhaps Sinea knew what he was thinking about; she tightly gripped his hand and just gazed into Lee Shin Woo’s skelatal face.\n\"We’re here.\"\n[This is it? I don’t feel anything though.]\n[You idiot. There’s no way living trees would be above ground.]\n[Oh, I see!]\nLee Shin Woo arrived at the exit that he and Erian had used to leave the vineyard. It was quite far from the winery.\n\"Here.\"\n[Ooooh!]\n[It was a dungeon!]\nWith a bit of control, Lee Shin Woo opened the dungeon’s entrance; the Dryads cheered and scrambled to get inside the dungeon. As more than 300 Dryads entered instantaneously, Sinea turned around to look at Lee Shin Woo and tilted her head.\n[Paul Zero, you’re not going in?]\n\"I’ll go in after setting up the safety device.\"\n[Ok. Thanks.]\nAs soon as all the Dryads went into the dungeon, Lee Shin Woo crouched down and tinkered with the entrance. The threads of mana that came from his hand cut off the branches, and Jin asked.\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"Nothing much. I’m just trying to copy the winery’s safety device.\"\n\"...You can do that?\"\n\"Why not?\"\nJin’s expression became dazed. Though Lee Shin Woo went beyond his expectations all the time, he felt as though Lee Shin Woo had gone to a place he couldn’t even begin to comprehend after undergoing various experiences with him.\n\"You said you didn’t know how to use magic.\"\n\"It’s simple once you learn the trick to it. You can’t even call this magic. It’s more like intuition.\"\nJin had his own hunch the moment he heard that. The ’intuition’ Lee Shin Woo was talking about was definitely different from the intuition he knew about!\n\"I’m finished... Now most people won’t be able to harm the spirits inside. Good, let’s go inside.\"\n\"I have no idea what you did to finish up, though...\"\nAs soon as Lee Shin Woo and Jin entered, the entrance softly shut and was camouflaged with the surrounding landscape.\nIt would be impossible to discover it unless someone like the 12 generals was involved. Even Lee Shin Woo wasn’t aware of it, but his mana abilities were growing at a considerably fast rate.\n[Waaaah!]\n[They’re really grapevines!]\n[It’s filled with trees! It’s overflowing with life!]\nBy the time they went down, the spirits had already sensed overflowing life energy and found the orchard filled to the brim with grapevines.\nThe two sources of such refreshing energy met, permeating the room with brightness. To be more specific, the Dryads’ voices prickled his ears, to the point that it was unbearable.\n[They’re really alive...!]\n[Ah, there really were living trees left...!]\nThe girls, upon discovering the lines of trees emitting such vigorous energy within the vast, underground orchard, each cradled one of the trees and expressed joy with their entire bodies. The grapevines selected by these Dryads emitted an even greater vigor than before.\n[These children are so healthy!]\n[How could they be so pure again when they were dirtied by human hands? This is...]\n[An elf. It’s an elf!]\nAs expected, these Dryads, as tree specialists, quickly figured out what had happened to these trees. Then, upon discovering Lee Shin Woo, who had just come down, the Dryads latched onto him and asked.\n[Paul Zero, were you an elf before you died?]\n[I had that feeling about you!]\n\"Nope, this place was already like this by the time I found it.\"\n[I see...]\n[There might be an elf still living in the Empire.]\n[I want to meet that elf!]\nBut that elf wasn’t born in the Empire... Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and approached them. He was trying to suck out any remaining curse within them just in case.\nThe Dryads obediently allowed Lee Shin Woo to do so and eventually, he purified them completely.\n\"Now we’re finished.\"\n[We’re all done?]\n\"Yeah. You guys can just keep living here now.\"\n[Ah...]\nLee Shin Woo had safely moved them to their new home, and just like he promised, had provided them with living trees. He’d also blocked off the entrance so that not just anyone could enter, and had absorbed the curse from them in its entirety, so they were planning on doing whatever he wished in return.\n[Thank you so much for helping us, Paul Zero.]\n[But we don’t know what we can do for you.]\n[We could’ve been a lot more helpful back when there was much more of our kind.]\nThis was after Lee Shin Woo had explained to them just what he did outside (while lying about a considerable number of things). His (seemingly) noble intent of purifying the Empire and destroying the undead had impressed them. Only Jin gazed at him as if he were a swindler, but that didn’t concern him.\n[Paul Zero.]\nThen, Sinea stepped forward. She had picked the toughest and most vigorous grapevine as her own, and perhaps because of that, the grapevine was already starting to emit a brilliant energy.\n[You’re our savior. We can never fully repay you for that, but we want to repay you in any way possible. We must.]\n\"...Mm.\"\nThey would probably look favorably upon him if he said that he didn’t do it seeking a reward, but Lee Shin Woo didn’t respond like that. Because if he lied too much, then there was a chance that the Dryads would get suspicious of him.\n\"To be honest... there is something I wanted from you.\"\n[Just tell us. We’ll do anything in our power to help you.]\nSinea was actually happy that he told her he wanted something from them. They truly were gullible, as it seemed like they would be fooled by anyone. But even now, Lee Shin Woo couldn’t complain as he was fooling them while receiving high praise.\n\"I told you that I was trying to purify the Empire, right?\"\n[Yeah. To be honest... I think it’ll be difficult.]\n\"There are people who are helping me. They’re fighting someplace else right now. Some of them are undead, and some of them aren’t.\"\n[...]\nThey already had Lee Shin Woo as an example, so they weren’t surprised. Hearing that, Sinea momentarily stood still and slowly nodded her head.\n[You’re saying that there’s still hope in this world... like these living trees that have survived in this seemingly dead world.]\n\"Yeah. And I want you guys to be a part of that hope.\"\n[Mmm.]\nHe wasn’t asking something from them, but was asking them to stand alongside him. Sinea murmured to herself. It wasn’t an easy decision as the representative of the Dryads. However...\n\"Just staying here is enough for now. However, there may be a day when I need your help. You just need to help out a bit then.\"\n[...Hoo.]\nSinea anguished over it, but could ultimately only respond in one way. Plus, it was something that all the Dryads wanted anyway.\n[I... as well as everyone else want to purify the Empire.]\n\"I appreciate you thinking that way.\" The source of thɪs content is noᴠelfire.net\n[I’m the one... who’s thankful.]\nLee Shin Woo stretched his hand out first, and Sinea stiffly grabbed onto it. It was truly a surreal sight.\n\"Ah, and now that you mention it.\"\nAfter they finished shaking hands, Lee Shin Woo took a step back; he suddenly remembered something and searched his inventory. He took out a stone radiating a turbid green. It was none other than the spirit stone that contained the power of the Dryads.\n[T-That’s...!]\n\"I know how you feel, but just wait a sec.\"\nWhen he’d first acquired it, he thought he wouldn’t be able to do anything to it, but now that he could suck out the curse with Jin’s ability, it was a different story. As soon as Lee Shin Woo glanced at Jin, he shrugged his shoulders and nodded his head.\n[Does that contain our mothers’ strength...?]\n[Look. The light’s gradually becoming clearer.]\nIt might’ve been difficult for Lee Shin Woo and Jin had the spirit stone been an ordinary item, but because it was an item that contained the power of spirits they’d encountered already, it was much easier than normal to suck out the swirling curse within.\n’Wow, Blessing of Death has increased again! Now I can die five times!’\n’That’s nice.’\nThough the darkness that permeated the spirit stone was quite strong, once he gained momentum, he was able to vigorously draw out the curse. Ultimately, the spirit stone returned to its perfect, clean state in less than a few minutes.\n[Spirit Stone holding the power of the Dryads]\nFirstly, the item’s explanation changed. The vividly green spirit stone was filled with so much elemental power that it felt like it would explode at any moment!\nThough it felt like he could absorb it himself... it would be better to give it to the person who could absorb it best, rather than absorb it just to increase his magic a bit.\n\"Here, take it.\"\n[You’re giving it to me...?]\n\"Of course. It belongs to your people.\"\n[Ah...]\nSinea accepted it with trembling hands. He’d somewhat expected this to happen, but at that moment, the magic within the spirit stone harmonized with Sinea and emitted an explosive light!\nLee Shin Woo watched closely as Sinea absorbed the magic from the spirit stone and was reborn. The other Dryads also silently approached and watched without saying a word. It seemed like they knew what exactly she was going through.\n[Lv6 Dryad Princess - Sinea]\nWhen the spirit stone’s light disappeared and Sinea could be seen once again, the spirit stone no longer remained in her hands.\nBut the fact remained that her level and her position had changed, as well as her power; the power she emitted was incomparable to before, proving that the spirit stone hadn’t disappeared in vain.\n[Thank you so much, Paul Zero.]\nThere wasn’t much change in her physique, but she possessed much more mana than before, as well as that mana becoming clearer. As she was composed of mana, her dress became more splendid. He supposed that that was proof that she was a higher level spirit than the others.\n[We’re... we will keep our promise to you. Always.]\nHer voice was trembling with effervescence and happiness. He could tell how she was feeling purely through her voice. As expected, these spirits really were messed up. Lee Shin Woo inwardly muttered.\n[Even if we die at the end of it, we will always...]\n\"No, it’d be pointless if you died, so you don’t have to go that far.\"\nSinea declared as she gazed more deeply at Lee Shin Woo, and Lee Shin Woo replied humbly and thought.\n’Everything is going as planned.’",

    "content": "<Chapter 21. Inherited Hope - 4>\n[Paul Zero, you have to come see us again!]\n[Heuk, heuk [1]. Paul Zero, don’t leave me.]\n[Bye, Paul Zero!]\nWhen Lee Shin Woo declared that he would leave immediately, the Dryads’ reactions were quite the sight. There were those who grabbed his hands, and there were those who acted like they were parting with their lover, as tears streamed down their cheeks.\nTheir initial reactions of him being a skeleton and being astonished were nonexistent at this point. This is usually what happens. While a first impression seemed like it was of utmost importance, they had ultimately forgotten all about it.\n\"I said I’d come back.\"\n[You have to come back!]\n[Since we want to repay you for introducing us to such lovely trees!]\n\"Yeah. I promise to come see you again.\"\nThough he had established his relationship with them through a false name, Lee Shin Woo suddenly thought that perhaps his relationship with the Dryads was actually more \"truthful\" than his relationship with the heroes he conversed with in the chatting channel.\n[Paul Zero, whenever you need our help, just give us a call.]\nSinea, as the representative of the Dryads, stepped forward, softly embraced Lee Shin Woo, and said her farewells. He softly tapped Sinea’s shoulder with his bone hand.\n\"Yeah, I’ll do that. I promise.\"\n[Take this.] ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ novel(ꜰ)ire.net\nShe said, and simultaneously passed Lee Shin Woo a small grapevine branch. As it possessed Sinea’s magic, who had been reborn as a Dryad Princess, he thought it might become the material for an artifact, but fortunately him grabbing the branch didn’t transform it into bone.\n[If you break this branch, I’ll come to your side, no matter where you are.]\n\"...Thanks.\"\nHe felt like his lie had worked almost too well, but Lee Shin Woo obediently took the branch.\nSinea looked relieved when she saw Lee Shin Woo pocket (into his inventory) the branch and then kissed his forehead... his frontal bone, and whispered so that only he could hear her.\n[An undead who’s not undead; without the energy of death. I hope that one day I can return to you your true appearance that has been hidden by the appearance of a skeleton.]\n\"...\"\nLee Shin Woo was slightly surprised, but his reply didn’t really give that away. It seemed like his silence was enough for her, as Sinea smiled softly and stepped back. She had instantly gained a commanding appearance upon absorbing the spirit stone and being reborn as a Dryad Princess.\n’Good for you.’\n’Ah, knock it off.’\nJin was jealous that Lee Shin Woo monopolized all of the Dryads’ attention, and left the orchard whilst inwardly quarreling with him. Of course, they weren’t going above ground immediately. They were using the railway to travel to the winery and leave through that exit instead.\nAnd by doing so, Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t have to worry about the Dryads for some time. They had everything they would need underground already, so as long as nobody disturbed them, they should be able to stockpile energy and grow from within.\nMoreover, their leader, Princess Sinea, had promised to aid him unconditionally, so he couldn’t ask for a better result. If he was a human, he probably would’ve sighed refreshingly right now, but it was quite unfortunate that he couldn’t.\n\"In any case, we’re finished with this.\"\n\"When I’m with you, everything becomes so hectic that I can’t even remember what we were originally trying to do.\"\nJin pointed out, and that resonated with Lee Shin Woo a bit. When he thought about it, he hadn’t originally set out to save the Dryads. He’d just gone to the forest using the knowledge of Vitas’ troops to level up his Acid Resistance.\nHowever, even when he thought about it himself, he couldn’t really give a good reason as to how the situation had become like this. He could only say that he had acted according to his instincts and this was the result that followed!\n\"But you were able to rest a little because of the Dryads, as we’ve been fighting all this time. Plus, you were able to see some beautiful women too.\"\n\"If this constitutes ’taking a break’, then how much do we have to move around for it to be called ’hectic’? ...Besides, all those beautiful women were flirting with you!\"\n\"Haha.\"\nIt seemed like Jin had accumulated a lot of stress from acting like a normal horse in front of the Dryads. Moreover, they had spent almost two months training their Acid Resistance skills, so they had managed to escape the throes of death. Maybe he’d achieve the feat of being the first undead that died from overworking himself.\n\"I got it. You used your curse absorption on them, and you’ve been working really hard lately, so let’s take our time for now.\"\n\"That’s not what I wanted to say, but... you said it, not me, so no take backs.\"\n\"Alright. We won’t do anything regarding resistances or dungeons for now.\"\n\"...Hmm.\"\nJin sounded quite satisfied! However, as soon as Lee Shin Woo relayed his next destination to Jin through Assimilation, he soon uttered in a stiff voice.\n\"Hey. This is where that senior who turned into an undead is.\"\n\"Yep.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s destination was an area that was somewhere between a danger level 2 zone and a danger level 3 zone. It was also the location where Shino Rendu had died and been reborn as an undead! It had been some time since, so he wanted to see if Metafel had left as well.\n\"You said we wouldn’t do anything regarding resistances or dungeons!\"\n\"While we’re taking it slow and sightseeing, I wanted to see how our senior is doing.\"\n\"And hunting him.\"\n\"Why do you have to say it like that? I just want to inherit my senior’s will. If I can, his abilities as well.\"\n\"You cruel bastard...\"\nThough Lee Shin Woo responded sarcastically, he didn’t actually feel all too good about this. There was no way he could be happy about fighting against his undead-turned senior when he had never treated him badly. Although he was both a swindler and an actor, he wasn’t a psychopath.\n’...Even so, it’s not something I can avoid. And it’s not something I should avoid.’\nEspecially because it was highly likely that Shino Rendu had encountered the Mercenary King, Metafel in his final moments. If those memories are intact, he had to acquire them no matter what. He didn’t have time to waste on pointless affection.\n\"You’ll go, right?\"\n\"Fine, you asshole.\"\n\"I wasn’t joking when I said we should go slowly. You don’t need to go full speed.\"\n\"What’s the occasion?\"\nJin inclined his head, looking for the direction the sun rose, even though no such sun existed in the Underground Empire. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo just shrugged his shoulders.\n\"Since we’ve been growing too rapidly thus far. We need the time to examine and get used to our abilities.\"\n\"That really doesn’t sound like something you would say...\"\nEven though Jin snorted in astonishment, he did as Lee Shin Woo said and began moving slowly. Though he was still moving so quickly that others couldn’t even see him, this speed was walking slowly for Jin.\n’Good. Right now my abilities are...’\nLee Shin Woo had become comfortable on Jin’s back, as if it were the living room of his house, and examined both his stats and skills.\nThus far, he’d encountered similar enemies and fought similar battles in the Forest of the Dryads, and had concentrated on using his skills. If he didn’t meditate over his skills and adapt to them at times like this, he might destroy himself [2] from using those skills over and over again.\n’I’ll forget about Acid Resistance for a while. The same goes for the Acid element as well... However, the method I figured out at the end of my training wasn’t bad.’\nSince he was thinking about it, he decided to summon some weapons into the air. If he excluded the armor set he was wearing right now, he could summon four pieces of equipment. All of the summoned weapons were the Lightning Tooth.\nWhen he fought in the Forest of the Dryads, the axe was the most appropriate weapon as it was of the Acid element, but in normal situations, the Lightning Tooth was the best, as it emitted powerful lightning. On the other hand, the Drake Horn Lance was... obviously an impressive weapon, but it bothered him that it didn’t possess its own element.\n\"You’re not going to throw those somewhere, are you?\"\n\"Don’t worry. Just look forward.\"\nMagic. The mysterious energy that inhabited all existence. It could possess an infinite number of properties depending on the wielder. However, one such property of magic was that those properties couldn’t be maintained for very long when magic is poured into something from the outside.\n’However, that rule isn’t applied to my bones, which are both my equipment, as well as my body.’\nTo be more exact, Lee Shin Woo made it so that rule didn’t apply. It sounded easy, but it required a substantial amount of willpower, as well as concentration.\nAs he split his magic into four different streams and inserted that mana into his weapons, he absorbed the outside surrounding mana within him, replenishing his magic. It wasn’t easy, but if he was able to do this naturally, his combat ability would increase as well.\n’Rather than trying to explode the weapons with the infused mana, I need to become proficient in collecting that mana back and using it.’\nIf he did so, his Bone Armory wouldn’t be just a simple storage house, but an extension of his body. And if it did become an extension of his body, Lee Shin Woo could gain ’power that couldn’t be measured strictly through levels’!\n’Now that I think about it, my stats are already at a total of 3,093. I only need to raise my stats by 107 to get to level 6...’\nHe’d bragged that he could get to level 6 in just a month when he was still level 4, and ever since he’d reached level 5 to now, he’d made the best choice he could in most situations, so it would be strange if Lee Shin Woo hadn’t grown by this much.\nUnfortunately, there was a huge gap between Lee Shin Woo and Jin now. When they had first met, Jin had been a higher level than Lee Shin Woo, but now, there was a difference of about 500 stats between them. Still, at the very least, Jin possessed the Child of Light skill, which increased his agility stat gain by three times, so the disparity hadn’t grown any larger than this.\n’The number of skills we have are way too different.’\nJin only had a few skills he could use (Steel Heart being the main one) and concentrated on those few skills, whereas Lee Shin Woo trained the variety of skills he’d gained from Bone Reinforcement as much as possible.\nMost low rank skills wouldn’t increase one’s stats very much even when they leveled up, but when they reached the intermediate level, even the most lousy looking skills would increase one’s stats by at least 5, so there was no way there wouldn’t be a gap between the two.\n’It doesn’t seem like Jin can obtain as many skills as me, even if I reinforce him with the same amount of bones as me... It can’t be helped. This might be the directions of our respective karmas.’\nThere was only a fixed number of bones that Jin could absorb, so there was a difference in the amount of bones the two could absorb; it would probably be better if he gave up on equalizing their stats.\nOf course, it wasn’t like Jin wouldn’t be helpful if his level dropped below Lee Shin Woo’s. Jin’s sprint related skills, his body designed for running, and above all, the imbalance of his high agility stat with his other stats that resulted in his speed, would certainly increase Lee Shin Woo’s strength.\n\"Shin Woo. Shin Woo!\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"Look over there.\"\nLee Shin Woo, who was thinking far into their future, was awoken by Jin’s voice. Because of their connection, Lee Shin Woo immediately knew what Jin was pointing at. It was a city. The amount of death energy being released from the city confirmed that it hadn’t been purified by the other heroes.\n\"What do you think? Should we stop by?\"\n\"...Yeah. I suppose we could stop by and then continue.\"\nIt should be ok, as it had nothing to do with resistances or dungeons. Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and followed Jin’s offer. Both Lee Shin Woo and Jin were unaware of this, but Jin had been considerably corrupted by Lee Shin Woo.\nExactly three hours later, they managed to purify the city. Anyone hearing that they’d purified a level 2 danger zone city within three hours would be shocked, but unfortunately, the two skeleton heroes had already forgotten what it meant to be ’normal’.\n[1] T/N: Crying sound.\n[2] E/N: His identity as a Joker and/or his adaptability.",

    "novel_title": "Stop, Friendly Fire!",
    "chapter_number": "Chapter 21 part5",
    "content": "<Chapter 21. Inherited Hope - 5 [End of Volume 4]>\n[You have perfectly purified the intermediate city, ’Buote’ where countless merchants from small towns gathered! You have acquired 2 permits to God’s secret shop. You have acquired 100,000 Perium. Proficiency in all combat related skills increase. The finding friend location function has been added. If your comrade permits you to do so, you can track their location.]\n[You defeated every undead in the city with a single blow! You are powerful enough to be called the most powerful level 5, as you easily overpowered similarly leveled undead. All stats have increased by 3.]\nLee Shin Woo had experience in clearing the similarly sized city, Kehebe, so he didn’t even need to worry about conquering this city, and just slaughtered every undead that came his way. But perhaps because of that, he achieved another feat and his stats increased.\nWell, he’d repeatedly killed level 5 elite undead in a single blow, which couldn’t be common within the ranks of level 5 heroes. Even if Lee Shin Woo was right about to level up to level 6, that is.\n\"So that’s how it is. The strongest level 5...\"\nLee Shin Woo felt like that title was exposing his location, so he wasn’t all that happy about it. No matter how much he boasted, he was still only the strongest amongst level 5s!\nHowever, he quickly regained his spirits. Someone might pick a fight with him if he were self-conceited or became too relaxed. It was always important to strive to improve oneself; even his own parents had told him that.\n\"So what did your parents do for a living?\"\n\"What’s with you all of a sudden?\"\nIn the process of conquering the city, he had consumed all of the level 5 elites bones he’d acquired, but the effects weren’t worth writing home about, so while he was here, Lee Shin Woo investigated all of the sewers as well. There was nothing in the sewers this time too.\nThere were some Anti-Skull hidden facilities remaining, but there was no one inside of them, so he felt twice the dejection. Was he becoming careless after recruiting the golems and Dryads as allies? He became angry, even though it didn’t really matter.\n\"Maybe the guys in here were smarter than the rest and regained their intellect on their own and left.\"\n\"How unfortunate.\"\n\"It’s not that unfortunate, you know.\"\nLee Shin Woo left the city gaining essentially nothing, and began running towards his destination with Jin once more. A few more hours passed like that.\n’Mmmm... I think I’m done with this now.’\nAfter he’d infused mana into the weapons, he maintained it, as well as drawing out that mana to use for his skills; in less than 4 hours of training, Lee Shin Woo mastered that technique. At the very least, he wouldn’t make a mistake while controlling this few weapons.\n’I’m done checking my stats too.’\nLee Shin Woo clenched and unclenched his fist a few times, and then nodded his head. He checked his stats, his skills, and even the titles he’d acquired thus far. His self-inspection was perfect. Even if he encountered a level 6 elite monster, he would be able to take it on without any problems.\n’Then, I suppose I should start resting a bit...’\nOf course, it was just called ’resting’, as Lee Shin Woo couldn’t waste his time with that. He took a ’deep breath’, opened his inventory, and took out a book from it. It was the book seemingly left behind by the Elementalist Mellonia, who had an amicable relationship with the Dryads.\n’There are a total of 5 volumes... It’s sorted by number.’\nHe opened the first volume. Though he was given the ability to speak and read this world’s language, because he had absorbed countless undeads’ memories and experiences, he didn’t really need to use that ability anymore, and was able to read the letters naturally.\nPerhaps because of that, he could understand the meaning behind each and every letter.\n[I hope that this book comes into the possession of one who loves spirits.]\nThe 1st volume started with such a cliche and pretentious line, and could be considered an introduction to spirits that was written personally by Mellonia. As he read the first volume, Lee Shin Woo was able to supplement his knowledge considerably with the absorbed Silver Ice Tiger’s canine.\nThere was a difference between theory and actual experience. He laughed at the fact that he was able to acquire both from Mellonia. High ranked knowledge and experience; it was easy for him to tell that Mellonia was someone renowned when she was alive as she possessed both.\n’But even Mellonia is saying that an Elementalist can’t use elemental power themselves, but instead uses the spirits to acquire it...’\nBased on the experiences he’d acquired from the earring, elemental power just referred to elemental magic.\nBut contrary to Lee Shin Woo, who had realized that he could transform his mana into said elemental power, Mellonia stated that one must form a contract with a spirit to do so.\nOf course, Mellonia was wrong. Since Lee Shin Woo was proof that she was wrong.\n’If that’s the case, then I don’t need to contract with a spirit as I can already use elemental power.’\nHowever, it didn’t seem like that was actually the case. As Mellonia said, spirits are as smart or smarter than humans, so they can also move independently, and the more authority the spirits have over an element, the more powerfully they can wield that element...\n[Above all, they lead their contractor to immortality.]\nAs Lee Shin Woo read that section, his goblin fire blazed. It was a phrase that he really didn’t like. Since entering the Underground Empire, the term ’immortality’ could cause Lee Shin Woo to shake. Thɪs chapter is updatᴇd by NoveIꜰire.net\nMoreover, if one could actually achieve immortality from contracting with spirits, then Mellonia shouldn’t have died.\n[A spirit causes their contractor to slowly, very slowly become like them. These spirits do not have the physical constraints of an aging body, but are composed of magic and a soul; in theory, they possess eternal life. But as the contractor slowly starts to resemble these spirits, what would happen to them in the end?]\n[The contract between a spirit and an Elementalist is like the relationship between trees and the Dryads who parasitize them. It becomes easy to understand by comparing the Elementalist to the tree, and the Dryads as the spirits. The moment the Dryads attach to these trees which have no ability or will of their own, the trees begin to obtain a certain spiritual power.]\n[In the process, the trees become a place where Dryads are born, as well as the resting place for the other Dryads. Ultimately, the tree becomes a new spirit. One of the reasons I made a research facility in the Forest of the Dryads is because I wanted to thoroughly observe the trees’ changes.]\nIt seems like Mellonia hadn’t come to the Forest of the Dryads with innocent intentions, contrary to what the Dryads had thought; it didn’t seem like she spent her days pleasantly researching by strolling through the forest, and breathing in the aroma of the forest. She said that she didn’t want any harm to come to the Dryads, yet she was clearly a researcher who studied the Dryads.\n[This is my supposition based on the Dryads’ relationship with trees. One day, an Elementalist contracted with spirits will lose their body and will become a pure astral body. If that’s the case, can we even call that an evolution? Can we call that immortality?]\nLee Shin Woo didn’t think so. They wouldn’t become a different species regardless of if they had a physical body or an astral body. There would be living organisms with superior physical bodies, as well as living beings with inferior astral bodies. One couldn’t conclude whether one was strictly better than the other.\nAnd if turning into an astral body was indeed considered a form of evolution, he wouldn’t walk that path. Giving up one thing to gain another; he was sick and tired of those kind of deals. He wanted it all now.\n’Hoo...’\nLee Shin Woo had already read 3 of the 5 volumes and inwardly sighed. He had attempted to learn a specific method of handling spirits, but the history of spirit theory was extensive, and there was a lot of knowledge and usage of spirits which seemed to be filled with only subjective opinions.\nOf course, that wasn’t bad. It wasn’t bad, but it felt like he was licking an extremely delicious and sweet fruit. Or the feeling of figuring out the history of the painting, but not providing the winning bid at an auction.\n’What about the other two remaining volumes? ...Huh?’\nThe 4th volume’s contents were much shabbier than the previous three volumes, yet it was the book detailing the method of contracting with spirits. It was the book Lee Shin Woo had been wanting to read the most!\n’Plus, the contents are dry.’\nVolume 1-3 had explained spirits quite enthusiastically, yet when he actually got to the method of contracting with spirits, it was extremely abstract, stating that one must find a place abundant with the energy of nature, which wasn’t very helpful and only stated things that were discouraging.\n[Spirits are living beings. Without life, there are no spirits. You must find a place most abundant with life.]\n[If one can become a knight through their own efforts, and a magician is heaven sent, then an Elementalist is chosen by nature. Personal training isn’t really instrumental in becoming an Elementalist. An abundance of mana is important, and above all, luck is paramount. That’s because one must be chosen by a spirit.]\n[An Elementalist must try to take after nature. Spirits love the most natural mana. Next, the more captivating you look to the spirits, the better.]\nThe first half of the 4th volume evoked the feeling of ’Conquer them! Make the spirits fall for you! The makeup that’ll make them fall for you!’. And the second half sounded like something a guru cultivating himself in a forest would say; the disconnect really bothered him.\n\"It’s exactly like I thought.\"\n\"What about?\"\n\"It was impossible to contract with spirits in this Empire, as the curse had already taken root.\"\n\"That’s quite unfortunate.\"\nIf he went into a dungeon, would spirits be in there? Even if there were, they wouldn’t easily form a contract with him. Moreover, he would need a charming exterior appearance; so long as Lee Shin Woo didn’t continually maintain his Disguise, the clear conditions were impossible! Since he was a skeleton!\n\"Ah, I already knew it all, but I read it thinking that maybe... Damn it. There’s only the last volume remaining, so I should read that.\"\n\"Are you the type that can’t stop reading a series even when it goes to shit?\"\n\"Don’t traumatize me.\"\nAfter Lee Shin Woo quieted Jin down, he started reading the 5th volume. It was Mellonia’s journal, and seemed like it was written after she had become an Elementalist. The dates were all mixed up, but they were properly arranged by time.\n[His name is Silver. They say all Silver Ice Tigers are like this, but Silver’s the only Silver Ice Tiger for me.]\n[Silver lead me to a different world. I was able to meet other Elementalists as well, and I, who was once a stupid countryside girl, was able to become a Royal Elementalist and wear nice clothes. Everything feels like a dream.]\nTo think she didn’t erase this section of her journal, the time when she was so naive. Perhaps this was the last thing Mellonia could remember? He felt slightly resistant in reading further, but Lee Shin Woo resolved himself and went to the next page.\n[It seems like I have an aptitude for magic. Since I have an aptitude in magic, and I’m also loved by a spirit, I can become a talented Elementalist. I’m not used to getting complimented by others.]\n[Someone more talented than me entered. They’re only 7 years old, yet they’ve been chosen by 3 high ranking spirits. Moreover, she’s the royal princess. Is it really ok for someone to have it all?]\nLee Shin Woo stopped at this part. If they were clearly this powerful, then perhaps Lee Shin Woo would meet them later.\nBut if that were the case, then Lee Shin Woo had to read further. He continued onto the next page without rest, and was able to obtain more information regarding the princess from Mellonia. However, Mellonia’s diary which detailed her life in the palace, ended abruptly with one sentence.\n[Silver died.]\nAfter that, what was depicted afterwards was dark. Reviving a spirit, the research involved, leaving the palace, as well as regarding where she disappeared to (the Forest of the Dryads)... And.\n[When I had no way out, and had fallen into despair, they found me.]\n[They said they would give me all the materials I needed, so I plan to follow them.]\n[I knew their resistance, their treachery would end in the worst way possible, but...]\n[But still, it doesn’t matter. A world without Silver can go to hell for all I care.]\nThat page ended with that final line. Ultimately, this was clearly related to his quest of uncovering the secret of the Empire (but not telling him about how things progressed beforehand)!\nLee Shin Woo sported a discouraged expression and wanted to burn the diary to a crisp, but he suddenly saw something written very small on the last page.\n[Does anyone have the Key to Heaven’s Gate? At the very least, that is something that doesn’t belong to either Anti-Skull or the Emperor.]\n\"...?\"\nPutting aside the fact that she knew about Anti-Skull, what’s with this clearly suspicious line...? Lee Shin Woo tilted his head. However, Jin called Lee Shin Woo at just the right time.\n\"Shin Woo, we’ve arrived.\"\nWhen Lee Shin Woo raised his head, he saw a completely ruined city before him. It looked a lot bigger than any other city he’d seen before, but because everything was broken, it felt truly empty.\nAbove all, what was most peculiar was the disorderly traces of undead in various places, yet they had already left the city. As well as the presence of a hero who’d become an undead... that had died alone silently within the city.\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\nLee Shin Woo shoved the five volumes of Mellonia’s books into his inventory and gripped one of the swords in the air. He pushed away the various thoughts in his head and sharpened himself, like a blade.\nHe could progress the quest later. That was the appeal of quests: he would have a bunch of them at once and eventually he’d complete them one by one.\nThere was only one thing of importance right now.\n\"He’s my senior, so I have to pay my last respects.\"",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 22 part1",
    "content": "<Chapter 22. The Beginning of a Corps - 1>\n[You are fighting against a higher leveled enemy. The Rebellion skill increases all stats by 10%! All stats increase by an additional 5% because of your partner. All effects are shared with your partner.]\n’Good. I’m all ready now...’\nLee Shin Woo gripped his sword and glared at the zombie. Unfortunately, he couldn’t approach from behind without him knowing and attacking. The moment they got close enough to recognize their enemy, the zombie... Shino Rendu also noticed them.\nWell, even a level 6 magician would’ve noticed their approach, so it would’ve been strange if Shino Rendu, who looked like a warrior, hadn’t noticed them approach. It was pretty much impossible to hide, as well as ambush a higher leveled enemy!\n’Especially because Shadow Sprint isn’t a perfect stealth skill.’\nIt would however help in concealing his appearance, as well as making it difficult to perfectly grasp his attacks. Before he was the one taking the first hit, he acted without wasting any time. All of his sprint related skills had activated.\n[By activating Intermediate Shadow Sprint, you become one with your shadow. Your sprint speed and your secrecy increase. It has become more difficult for your opponent to grasp your form.]\n[You have activated Low Rank Twin Horn Charge. The force of your charge increases. The moment you ram into your opponent with your horns, your destructive power increases overwhelmingly.]\n’If I knew it would be like this, I would’ve summoned a Drake Horn Lance as one of them.’\nLee Shin Woo hadn’t looked far enough ahead. If his plan was to execute a charging attack on his opponent as soon as he noticed him, then he shouldn’t have summoned four Lightning Tooths; instead, he should’ve summoned a single Drake Horn Lance just in case.\nHowever, he didn’t have enough time to unsummon one of his Lightning Tooths and summon a Drake Horn Lance right now; plus, it was a waste of mana. He patted Jin whilst taking a mental note of not making the same mistake in the future.\n\"Let’s go!\"\n\"Heup!\"\nThe hero who’d become undead, Shino Rendu, looked exactly like a human from a side view, but the moment he noticed Lee Shin Woo and Jin, there was a sudden ’kwang’ sound from the floor! He had struck the floor and piles of rocks shot up everywhere, hiding him.\nLee Shin Woo could tell that Shino Rendu’s physical strength was much higher than his own after seeing that move.\n’Fighting him face-to-face is risky.’\nA red light went off in Lee Shin Woo’s head. They could only win with a hit and run strategy! However, Jin turned directions at that very moment. Immediately after, Lee Shin Woo’s head passed by a rock.\n\"He’s throwing them!\"\n\"Hoo...!\"\nIt’d be great if he hit them, and even if he missed, he would cause Jin to dodge, which would reduce his speed, as well as the resulting force; was that his intent? That was the moment that Lee Shin Woo realized that their opponent retained his reasoning somehow, despite being undead.\nIf that’s the case, then the last thing he needed to check was... The moment Lee Shin Woo gripped his sword, Jin knew what he was planning, and charged once more, dashing through the area covered in thick dust. It seemed as though they had instantaneously closed the gap, yet then they would seemingly be far away. It was because Jin had intentionally turned around.\n’3, 2... Now!’\n’Kuu!’\nAnd in the next instance, Jin’s steel covered legs momentarily stretched in a direction that they normally shouldn’t be able to. Then, he kicked off the ground; Lee Shin Woo and Jin’s bodies bent at a 90 degree angle and turned to the right. This was their intention from the start!\nThey launched towards the impact area like a rocket, and that impact area was where Shino Rendu was. He threw another rock at them, had missed due to Jin’s charge, and tilted his head!\n\"Hit!\"\nShino Rendu, who had belatedly noticed Lee Shin Woo, raised his arm, but at that moment, Lee Shin Woo’s sword burrowed deep into Shino Rendu’s head!\n[Kuhaahk!]\nAfter Lee Shin Woo had stuck his sword into the back of Shino Rendu’s head, he gave it up. Lee Shin Woo’s sprint skills, as well as Jin’s frightening speed combined, resulting in the power that would blow away their enemy, regardless of if they were a level 6 elite.\n\"Good job, Jin. Nice drift.\"\n\"That guy’s standing up!\"\n\"He can’t stand up.\"\nWhat would be the point of filling the Lightning Tooth with mana if he didn’t blow it up? Lee Shin Woo didn’t give Shino Rendu, who was arduously standing from the floor, even a little bit of time as he immediately exploded the Lightning Tooth stuck in his head. And Shino Rendu emitted an awful scream.\n[Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\n\"Tch, did I screw up?\"\n\"You’re sure you didn’t kill him?\"\nLee Shin Woo muttered, and Jin replied, stunned. However, immediately after, Shino Rendu dashed out of the explosion. Lee Shin Woo gazed at Shino Rendu and was speechless. He didn’t think he would be able to instantly kill an undead who was once a hero, but...\n’He’s regenerating, too.’ Googlᴇ search novel⚑fire.net\nIt happened immediately after the burrowed Lightning Tooth burst into a lightning explosion. It wouldn’t have been strange if his bones crumbled and his rotten flesh was burnt.\nHowever, the occipital region of his head was regenerating from the Lightning Tooth’s explosion, as if time had been rewound. His bones, his brain, his blood, his skin, everything!\n[Kuhahk...! U-Undead...!]\n\"He’s even talking now.\"\nWhat the hell was that unbelievable super regeneration that even restored his brain? The warning bells rang in Lee Shin Woo’s head. He was sure that his regeneration didn’t even compete with Shino Rendu’s!\n\"Hoo.\"\nLee Shin Woo looked upon Shino Rendu, who stumbled while standing up, chuckled, and got back into position. He called another Lightning Tooth into his empty hand, and summoned a new weapon from Bone Armory to fill in the gap. The Melting Bone Double Axe.\n’If lightning doesn’t work, then I have no choice but to go with acid this time.’\nHis Acid element had grown substantially. If acid didn’t work, then nothing else would work; he could just run away if it didn’t work. In any case, it was clear that they were ahead of him in agility.\n[Undead...! D-Die!]\nIn between, Shino Rendu had regained his posture, stretched out his right arm and charged at them.\nHis right arm was just as impressive as his super regeneration. It was his right arm that had struck the floor upon discovering Lee Shin Woo; if he exerted force into his right arm, it would temporarily glow with a red light, turning his arm gigantic.\nThat gave him supernatural strength, proving his authority as a hero.\n’And his supernatural regeneration ability is the same. He’s got both strength and regeneration, so he’s pretty much invincible. Are all the other heroes this monstrous?’\n...But when he thought about it calmly, Shino Rendu obviously wouldn’t have died to one of the 12 generals if he were invincible.\nThere was probably a limit to his strength, and there would likewise be a limit to his super regeneration. Lee Shin Woo’s goblin fire didn’t fade. No, it actually blazed even more than before.\n’If I fight against a strong foe and defeat him... I’ll grow even quicker!’\nJin responded to the charging Shino by kicking off the floor himself. He was planning on using the same movement that they just used, but Shino Rendu smashed the floor with his fist, as if saying that he wouldn’t fall for their scheme a second time. Pieces of stone surged in all directions! Was this a skill as well? Each and every rock possessed an unusual amount of force.\n\"Tch... You thought that would work!?\"\nJin responded so quickly that their connection temporarily became faint, breaking through the area the skill was in effect. Lee Shin Woo grit his teeth and gripped the Lightning Tooth in preparation for the coming collision. His goal was to not get hit while simultaneously lodging his sword into the back of Shino’s head.\n[I won’t... fall for that twice!]\nBut before Lee Shin Woo’s sword came into contact with his head, Shino stuck out his right arm, as if taking Lee Shin Woo head on; his stuck out right arm created an intense pressure on the surrounding area.\nDespite not personally crashing into him, both Jin and Lee Shin Woo’s bodies simultaneously felt his absurd strength! His physical strength was augmented by a magical force as well.\n\"Tch...!\"\n\"Gguaaaaahk!\"\nLee Shin Woo’s body suddenly stopped midair. He momentarily thought it was a waste, and shot one of the Lightning Tooths that had followed behind him into the air.\nShino attempted to intercept this one was well, but the Lightning Tooth, filled with an abundant amount of mana, was able to disperse the pressure, and struck the middle of Shino’s forearm. It softly cut through the arm as if slicing through cheese, as it was powered by an overwhelming amount of magic!\n[Kuaaaaaaaahk! You bastarrrrrrd!]\n\"Heup!\"\nShino cried out, and forcefully flailed his arm, but at that moment, the pressure that prevented Lee Shin Woo from moving was released! At that very moment, Lee Shin Woo stuck his Lightning Tooth into Shino’s arm. It was a truly lightning like combo!\n\"Heut!\"\nLee Shin Woo had succeeded in his attack, and the moment he retreated, Shino’s arm cut through the air emitting a menacing piercing power. If he were hit by that, a part of his body would’ve been smashed to bits regardless of his defense; fortunately he had attacked after Lee Shin Woo was quite a distance away.\n\"Explode!\"\n[Kuaaaaaaahk!]\nThe two Lightning Tooths simultaneously exploded and Shino’s arm broke into pieces. Lee Shin Woo, who had evaded the explosion by retreating, gripped his last remaining Lightning Tooth and pressed Jin to dash forward again. If he regenerated his arm, things would become difficult!\n\"Heuuup...!\"\n[You undead bastards...! You hateful...!]\nHe had already activated his super regeneration, and his bones, as well as his muscles were beginning to heal starting from his shoulder. Lee Shin Woo, who thought that he would miss his chance to attack in just a few seconds, gritted his teeth and stretched out his sword.\n[Kuahk!]\nShino Rendu attempted to hold Lee Shin Woo back with his left arm, which was tiny in comparison to his right arm, but unfortunately, his left arm wasn’t able to stand up against Lee Shin Woo’s Lightning Tooth. Immediately after sparks were emitted atop the blade, Shino’s left arm flew into the air.\n\"Then... Rest in peace, Senior!\"\n\"Did you really have to say something like that!?\"\nLee Shin Woo, gripping his sword, immediately lodged his sword into Shino’s head. With a cracking sound, his head was cleaved in two.\nBefore his super regeneration repaired that crack, his previously summoned Melting Bone Double Axe which he had poured mana into and charged prior, precisely burrowed into the crevice. Even Lee Shin Woo thought that his control was hair-raising.\n\"Explode, the both of you!\"\n[Kahahk!]\nThe final remaining bombs exploded. Lee Shin Woo and Jin weren’t able to dodge the ensuing explosion completely, and were swept away by the rear blast. However, it wasn’t as bad as having their head blown off.\n\"Hoo...\"\n\"Huuu...\"\nLee Shin Woo inspected Shino Rendu, who had fallen flat on his face, and sighed deeply. Jin also spoke as though he was sapped of all his energy.\nIt was a battle where they used all available means to win in such a short time. He had used up all four Lightning Tooths saturated with mana in an instant, and even the Melting Double Bone Axe as well!\n[..., ...!]\nBut in exchange, it was truly that effective. Perhaps because Shino had lost both his arms and his head in one fell stroke, his super regeneration had slowed down, and the addition of Acid Poison following the explosion would melt away his body, even if those body parts were restored!\n’We won.’\nLee Shin Woo smiled pridefully, and stretched out one arm into the air. The weapon he’d summoned and gripped was none other than the Drake Horn Lance.\nSince he was his senior, should he give him a magnificent end? Screw that. Despite using up all of his weapons, he hadn’t yet died and endured, so Lee Shin Woo had no choice but to completely end him.\n\"You’re ready, right Jin?\"\n\"Hoo... Ok.\"\nAs it was a short and intense battle, Jin was likewise pushing himself. He had been continuously turning his body here and there whilst pushing his concentration to the limit. As a result, he had sustained damage in various places on his body. If he weren’t undead, he would’ve fallen over already. Likewise, if it weren’t for Steel Heart, his lumbar vertebrae would already have been broken.\n\"Good, then.\"\n[Did you say... Senior?]\nBut then, Lee Shin Woo heard a voice that made his body feel cold. Were his vocal cords restored during that time!? Of course, there were several who could speak without vocal cords in this world, so it wasn’t actually something that surprising!\n[Yeah. I’m a... hero...]\n\"No, you’re undead.\"\n[Undead... I’m undead...]\nLet’s finish it here. It would be better to finish it here than let things get out of hand, right? Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and raised his lance high up into the air.\n’Calling...’\nWith the mana (he’d stored a ton of mana into his Lightning Tooths, so he had about 80% of his mana left) he had remaining, Lee Shin Woo infused his mana into the tip of the lance, creating a dark blue lightning.\n[I don’t want to...]\n\"Thunder...\"\n[die... though.]\nWhy was it? The moment he heard that, Lee Shin Woo lost all strength in his body. He tried to figure out why, but his actions just came out as obviously illogical to him... Despite coming to that conclusion, he ultimately spoke like this.\n\"...Do you want to live, even at the cost of living on as an undead?\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 22. The Beginning of a Corps - 2>\n’Shin Woo!?’\n’I have a lot on my mind right now, so don’t talk to me.’\nThat arm containing superhuman strength and that super regeneration. It was obvious that if he were to obtain both of those, he would become much stronger.\n[Can you even... call this living...?]\n\"Fine then. If you want to die, then...\"\n[No...!]\nBut because he noticed Shino Rendu was clearly regaining his reasoning, he couldn’t thrust his lance.\nIt could aptly be called a whim, but he didn’t feel inclined to pierce his lance forward and end Shino’s life.\n[Let me live... Even if I have to live as an undead...]\n\"Alright. Sure, I’ll let you live.\"\n[Ah, ahh...!]\nImmediately after he said that, Lee Shin Woo chuckled as he suddenly looked back at the thoughts he’d had the day he rescued Ye Jin Jin.\n’That it would be more advantageous to do that. How absurd.’\nA human cannot always calculate the outcomes of a situation and then act. Life isn’t a game. He didn’t know if he would regret making this decision, but... perhaps this decision would be the greatest decision he’s ever made.\nHe didn’t know how the future would turn out, so it was an especially attractive choice. It was a choice that followed his heart. As a Joker, he couldn’t make any other choice.\n\"My name’s Paul Zero. What’s yours?\"\n[Shino... Rendu...]\nAlthough he was undead, Shino Rendu was different from the other Pauls and precisely remembered his name; perhaps this was because he was a high level before he died. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and spoke.\n\"Do you hate humans?\"\n[No way! I was... human...]\n\"But you’re not now.\"\n[...]\nHe remained silent for a second, and examined his body. At the sight of the rotten flesh on his right arm being regenerated, as well as the splattering black blood, he accepted that he was an undead.\n[A dead body...]\n\"How about it? I can kill you if you’ve changed your mind.\"\n[I want to live... Let me live...]\n\"What do you want to do if you live?\"\n[Revenge...!]\nHe had roughly anticipated that. Lee Shin Woo replied harshly.\n\"Who do you want revenge on?\"\n[Metafel...! The undead!]\n\"Good. That’s enough.\"\nSince it’s come to this, he couldn’t help but accept it. His memories of being human were intact, and was acting in accordance to his goals as a human... Shino Rendu was undergoing the same phenomenon as the other Pauls. He didn’t know why that was. Since other heroes who became undead couldn’t all go through the same phenomenon.\n’If that’s the case, is it because he met me?’\nNo way. Lee Shin Woo just laughed at his unbelievable assumption. These guys possessed the disposition of becoming like this. Their strong tenacity, as well as their deep-seated grudges would meet, allowing for them to be awakened!\n\"Follow me. I’ll help you get you revenge on him one day.\"\n[I’m...!]\n\"Anything else and I’ll kill you. This isn’t an offer, nor is it a request. It’s an order.\"\n[Keuk...]\nLee Shin Woo spoke in an excessively strong voice, and stopped Shino from voicing his opinion. There were two reasons for him wanting to make Shino Rendu his subordinate.\nFirstly, he couldn’t let someone so dangerous free without some restraints on him. Secondly, if he can’t have his abilities, then he would only be satisfied by owning the possessor of those abilities.\n\"Will you follow me?\"\n[...I’ll follow you.]\nSparks flickered across the Drake Horn Lance. He raised the lance into the air and then thrust it into the ground. Blue sparks spread everywhere, causing Shino Rendu to tremble. Lee Shin Woo spoke quietly.\n\"Again.\"\n[I will follow you, sir.]\n\"Good, Shino. Henceforth, you’re my subordinate.\"\nOnce Shino Rendu understood, and obediently accepted Lee Shin Woo as his master, an unbreakable master-servant relationship was formed between them. Once that connection was formed, black light surged from Shino Rendu’s entire body.\nAnd Lee Shin Woo knew exactly what that signified. It was the same light that would appear when a Paul was reborn as an elite!\n[You have succeeded in making a higher leveled individual your subordinate. It was difficult to tame him, but so long as you succeed in taming him, he will become your greatest helper. The Intermediate Command skill has become Lv3. All stats have increased by 1.]\n[The Lv6 Zombie Elite has transformed into the Lv6 Undead Avenger - Shino Rendu.]\nLee Shin Woo thought that was it, but he was wrong. In fact, they were only now moving onto the main topic.\n[You have successfully inspired a ruined hero who had forgotten his past with a new purpose! Revenge is the most simple and most powerful emotion. That will allow him to remain an undead that is not truly an undead. Proficiency in all corresponding skills has greatly increased.]\n[The Acting skill has become Lv14. You can induce the desired response from an individual with even the simplest of words.]\n[The Instigate skill has become Lv2. Magic has increased by 10. The emotions of those who hear your voice can be more easily moved.]\n[The Rebellion skill has become Lv2. All stats have increased by 3. Whenever you satisfy a condition for the Rebellion skill, stats increase even further. Currently, stats are increased by 12%.]\nBecause he hadn’t killed the hero, he wasn’t rewarded with the quest reward, but as he had expected, a variety of his skills had grown. Leveling up his Instigate and Rebellion skills was especially huge. Though he didn’t really know why those two skills had leveled up!\n[Hooooo...]\nAround the time Lee Shin Woo was finished reading all the messages, the light began to wane, and Shino Rendu was revealed, being reborn as a never before seen class, the Undead Avenger.\nNot only was his once injured head and arm completely healed, but the pitch black magic formed a bleakly glowing armor that covered his entire body, likely in exchange for the equipment that he’d lost from fighting against Metafel’s undead army.\n’Those guys get some cool armor once they turn into elites, but what about me?’\n’Then why don’t you stop being a hero and just start being an undead?’\n’My bad.’ The rıghtful source is novｅlfire.net\nAfter Lee Shin Woo honestly apologized to Jin, they approached Shino Rendu. Shino Rendu briefly examined his body, but soon nodded his head as if satisfied.\n[It’s not bad... sir.]\n\"How much do you remember from before you died?\"\n[Not... much.]\nOnce he became an Undead Avenger, he talked more naturally than before. Lee Shin Woo was becoming more and more envious of this guy. He was an undead in name, but he had flesh on his bones.\nAs expected, the higher leveled they were when they died, the more vibrant they were when they revived. If the starting point was a skeleton, then one would end up as a skeleton. Shit!\n[But... I do remember that I was originally a hero that was dispatched here. And that I had to kill all of the undead. That’s all I remember. Ah, and lastly... that Metafel killed me!]\n\"Very good. That’s plenty.\"\n[...]\nIt was a comment befitting an Undead Avenger, who acted based on their hatred and vengeance. Pleased, Lee Shin Woo nodded his head as Shino Rendu glanced at him perplexingly.\n[Who exactly... are you?]\nHe sure was quick to ask. Of course, they had attacked each other when they first met, so he didn’t really have the time to ask.\n[An undead that goes around hunting other undead... Moreover, that intellect, as well as that peculiar ability. Are you also an undead who was once a hero?]\nIt seemed like this guy became a lot smarter than when he was alive!? However, he couldn’t be honest with him, so Lee Shin Woo roughly concocted a suitable response.\n\"I wonder. Perhaps I was a hero some time ago. It’s been a long time. Right now, I just cut through any undead I encounter.\"\n[I see... How peculiar. I wonder why I’ve just been killing all of the undead I’ve encountered thus far. Why didn’t I have any doubts about that?]\n\"...What about now?\"\n[On the contrary... it feels like I can see things more clearly now.]\nShino Rendu said. Lee Shin Woo could see the pitch black goblin fire beyond Shino’s helmet; That was proof that he wasn’t human, but undead.\n[I see this world differently now.]\n\"That’s a relief. ...More importantly, since you fought against Metafel, you should know his special characteristics. Tell me about those in detail. Since we’ll face him someday.\"\n[Alright. I’ll tell you everything I know.]\nLee Shin Woo listened as Shino Rendu told him everything he knew then and there. The tens of thousands of troops that the Mercenary King Metafel lead, as well as the fearsome strength of the level 7 Metafel...\n\"Level 7?\"\n[That’s right. He has a few level 7 undead troops as well, but Metafel’s strength is on another level...]\nAs expected, Metafel was weaker than the other 12 generals! He had thought so ever since he’d fought against the level 6 Corps Commander, Vitas, but it seemed like he was right. Lee Shin Woo inwardly marked Metafel as the weakest of the 12 generals.\n[Moreover, Metafel... often eats his subordinates to increase his strength. I feel like he was... a ghoul. He was likely a high rank ghoul at that...]\n\"Mmm, that’ll definitely be troublesome.\"\nA ghoul normally eats corpses, restoring its vitality and mana. If there was plenty of prey, there was no enemy harder to face than a ghoul; that ’hard to face’ ghoul was the leader of a corps! He was just like Popeye who carried spinach around with him everywhere!\n\"Hmm? If he’s a ghoul, how did you manage to keep your body?\"\n[I was buried in debris during our fight... He ordered his troops to look for me, but because all of those troops were low rank...]\n\"They’re all idiots, so they couldn’t find you. You remained hidden until the very end.\"\n[He was just too strong for me, so I was buried under debris. That’s all. I was... lucky.]\nLee Shin Woo remembered the superhuman strength that Shino Rendu exhibited. To think that Metafel was even stronger than that; though he considered Metafel the weakest of the 12 generals, he was still one of the 12 generals. He was pissed that he wasn’t at that level yet, but he had no choice but to accept it.\n[So, I became level 6 in the middle of the fight... yet I still died.]\n\"Tch.\"\nShino Rendu had definitely spoken like that. That he attempted to grow too quickly, and would die as a result. He had died after achieving what he’d wanted, so he couldn’t even begin to describe the bitterness he must feel. Lee Shin Woo thought that perhaps that bitterness allowed him to maintain his reasoning even after becoming an undead, and felt strange.\n\"Why did you go that far?\"\n[I had a junior who was so talented... Everyone liked that junior. Especially Seira...]\n\"...Huh?\"\n[Heroes... welcome exceptional heroes. I... just wanted to become like that as well.]\n\"...\"\nThat comment made Lee Shin Woo feel dirty. After all, that junior he was talking about was him! Moreover, he had wanted to become just like Lee Shin Woo; he should’ve been careful with what he wished for, as he became an undead just like him.\nHow could something so stupid happen... Lee Shin Woo sighed (even though nothing came out), and clutched his forehead.\n\"Fine. Forget about the past. You’ve decided to live on as an undead. You don’t have to concern yourself with heroes any longer. You’re not a hero, you’re an Undead Avenger.\"\n[...Of course.]\nHe sounded like he was full of regret, but Lee Shin Woo ignored that. Didn’t Shino Rendu say it himself? That the heroes would kill the undead no matter what. If they forgot about that, they might be faced with a horrific end.\n[Then what... should I do now?]\nShino Rendu asked. However, that’s what Lee Shin Woo wanted to ask himself. He had wanted to pay his final respects to his senior, as well as gain some abilities, but he hadn’t even paid his final respects; instead, he had resurrected him...\n\"I have some other subordinates I’ve taken in already.\"\nBut the Joker, Lee Shin Woo had already reached the pinnacle of acting. He subconsciously moved his lips after finding the best possible scenario.\n\"Join up and lead them, and destroy the undead.\"\n[I understand.]\nTo think he already had other subordinates; he truly was an extraordinary individual! Shino Rendu became certain of this and after clearing his mind, and nodded his head.\nWhile Lee Shin Woo caused trouble here and there for no reason, the beginnings of an undead force that destroyed other undead was gradually becoming visible.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 22 part3",
    "content": "<Chapter 22. The Beginning of a Corps - 3>\nThere existed something amongst his subordinates that allowed them to instinctually find each other. He’d become sure it existed after observing the Pauls, and sure enough, Shino Rendu didn’t really need to ask where Lee Shin Woo wanted him to go, because he was able to figure out where they were.\n[There are quite a lot of them.]\n\"It’ll just get bigger from now on.\"\n[...What do you wish for?]\n\"The purification of the Empire.\"\n[Like the heroes.]\n\"...Perhaps.\"\nLately, he thought of something else, aside from just the purification of the Empire, but didn’t say it out loud. Even he himself thought it was unreasonable, so the moment he spoke it out loud, he felt like he’d just be ridiculing himself.\n\"Are you ok with just that?\"\n[I originally fought with my fists. There were times where I fought with a greatsword as well...]\nFists and greatswords; those two definitely fit his image of Shino Rendu. Moreover, that fist. He shouldn’t have needed another weapon aside from that fist.\n[Moreover, the moment I was reborn as an Avenger, all the karma within my inventory disappeared and was transformed into this armor... Because of that, I’ll be able to better use my authority.]\n\"Huh?\"\nLee Shin Woo tilted his head, and Shino Rendu seemingly knew that he wouldn’t be able to understand what he meant by his inventory disappearing, so he explained starting there.\n[The inventory is exclusive to heroes. It’s like a subspace storage house... I became unable to use my inventory when I became an undead, and all of the karma within my inventory turned into this armor. All my accumulated Perium thus far... the bones I hadn’t sold... equipment... everything.]\n\"Huh...!?\"\nLee Shin Woo momentarily couldn’t believe his ears. However, he soon shuddered as he realized that he didn’t even have any ears.\nHe didn’t hear wrong. Shino Rendu was saying not only were bones used in the formation of his armor, but also all the karma he possessed!\n’Was that always possible?’\nWell, it probably was always possible. Didn’t the shop owner, Pleine tell him before? That it wasn’t possible for Lee Shin Woo to change Perium into a different type of karma at this point in time. That meant that it was possible to change the karma into a different form so long as one had the ability to do so!\n[It’s strange for me as well. It seems like it wasn’t something normal.]\n\"It was the moment your karma changed from being a simple zombie to an Avenger, so I don’t think it’s that weird.\"\n[...Indeed. If you think about it that way, it’s not hard to understand.]\nSeeing Shino Rendu calmly nod his head at his words, Lee Shin Woo pledged that he would examine every type of karma he acquired from now on.\nEspecially Perium! Since there weren’t any bones he could buy at the secret shop anymore, he might be able to create something more effective than just weapons or skill books!\n[Then, I’ll get going immediately.]\n\"I already told you, but try to avoid heroes as best you can. They won’t believe that you’re Shino Rendu.\"\n[I’ll keep that in mind.]\nIt looked like he didn’t understand based on his expression, but so long as it was a direct order from Lee Shin Woo, he had no choice but to obey.\nThat was also the reason he formed a master-servant contract with him. In this world, contracts were absolute! He was probably the one most informed about contracts amongst his fellow heroes.\n\"Good. He left.\"\n\"Ah. In the end, another Paul was created.\"\nWhen Jin could no longer see Shino at all, he opened his mouth. Read complete versıon only at novelfire(.)net\nIt wasn’t like he was really trying to hide his identity. It’s just that conversing with the undead was kind of awkward. Plus, he was an undead that was originally a hero! Talk is cheap; one wouldn’t even think of talking with the undead, unless they were Lee Shin Woo that is.\n\"Are you going to do that for every undead hero we meet from now on?\"\n\"That sounds interesting, but I’m not sure I can do that every time.\"\nLee Shin Woo still wasn’t very sure as to how he made Shino Rendu into his subordinate. If he met one or two more undead heroes, he should be able to figure out how he did it.\nHe shrugged his shoulders and changed the subject.\n\"Shino Rendu definitely said that once they figured out he was a hero, one of the 12 generals was summoned here, right?\"\n\"Still, it’s a relief that the men brought by one of the 12 generals were taken care of.\"\n\"...It feels kind of disappointing to leave like this, so let’s take a lap around the city.\"\nUnfortunately, this city, which had been trampled by Metafel’s troops, left nothing to do or explore as it was all ruined.\nLee Shin Woo got on top of Jin and took a lap around the city; Lee Shin Woo searched the surrounding area with mana, which was an ability that level 5s couldn’t possibly have. But even with his senses, he couldn’t find anything of note. No matter what they did, they couldn’t figure out how the troops contacted Metafel.\n\"The sewers... are just regular sewers. Indeed, it doesn’t seem like the right place for Anti-Skull to hide.\"\n\"It’s possible that they awakened on their own without needing us, and joined up with Anti-Skull.\"\n\"That’s probably what they did, but still, I wanted to find those traces and follow them to Anti-Skull’s headquarters.\"\n\"Headquarters, huh...\"\nLee Shin Woo had been given a quest where he had to find an executive from Anti-Skull. Of course, he would eventually be able to clear the quest as time passed, but if given the chance, Lee Shin Woo thought it wouldn’t be so bad to search for them and find them on his own.\nThe faster he found them, the better his plan would play out.\n\"...Plan? What plan?\"\n\"What are you talking about all of a sudden?\"\nLee Shin Woo reprimanded him, as it seemed as though Jin didn’t know about his plan.\n\"There’s an organization that’s resisting the Emperor amongst his troops. They’d be useful; there’s nobody better. You didn’t know that this quest was given to me as a hint that I should use Anti-Skull?\"\n\"That’s what it meant!?\"\n\"Oh, so you didn’t know about it.\"\nLee Shin Woo softly patted Jin’s neck, as if saying that he should work harder. That really pissed off Jin, and consequently began to shake his body like a rodeo; but because Lee Shin Woo was so familiar with this ’rodeo’, like he was a cowboy, he didn’t drop from Jin’s back. Ultimately, Jin could do nothing but accept his defeat.\n\"It’s an organization that’s involved with one of the 12 generals, Seagald. There’s a lot we could get from them.\"\n\"You’re... You’re always looking so far into the future.\"\n\"Alright. Now that you mention it, let’s start moving actively, now shall we?\"\nThis was their first time entering a danger level 3 zone, but it was still the same as usual. There were still plenty of sewers that they hadn’t cleared within the level 2 danger zones (though they had cleared most of the sewers in the level 1 danger zones)!\nThere should still be several Pauls waiting to be rescued, and before he earnestly moved on to the level 3 danger zones, he planned to finish saving them all (a.k.a. brainwash them). If he could, he would level up in the process.\n\"What about undead heroes?\"\n\"Aside from Shino Rendu, most of them are beyond the level 3 danger zones... Of course, there are some in the level 1 or 2 danger zones as well, so I’m planning to do both at the same time.\"\n\"It’d be quite the sight to see if you made all of them your subordinates and put them all in one place.\"\nJin recalled Shino Rendu bowing his head before Lee Shin Woo and snickered, finding it laughable. Lee Shin Woo sighed and shook his head.\n\"Even I think you’re getting out of hand, so let’s leave it at that. And it makes me feel ticklish when you laugh like that, so stop.\"\n\"What?\"\nOnce they were finished with their very short break (if one can consider entering a level 3 danger zone and fighting a level 6 undead hero a break), they went back to the danger level 2 zones. With Jin’s remarkable speed, as well as sometimes using the golem train, they began to go around to every city in the Empire.\n\"What about dungeons?\"\n\"Ah... I don’t think those will really be helpful to me, so I’ll leave them be. I have to leave something for my future juniors.\"\n\"When were you so considerate of your juniors...\"\nOf course, there weren’t as many hidden facilities in the level 2 danger zones as there were in the outskirts of the Empire. However, if they found one, they would find a considerable amount of Pauls that hadn’t awakened yet.\n[Pauls 118 - 150 will only follow your commands, Paul Zero!]\n[We’re not Anti-Skull, but we’ll try to become even greater than them!]\n\"Oh... R-Right.\"\nAfter Lee Shin Woo labored in vain a few times, he gained 33 level 4 Doom Factors as subordinates, and realized that this entire region was an endless gold mine. As expected, the higher the danger zone, the higher quality the Pauls would be!\n[Paul Zero!]\n[Paul Zero! Paul Zero!]\nHe moved around busily, searching the level 2 danger zone cities; the more he searched the sewers where these Anti-Skull hidden facilities were located, the more materials he gained. Anti-Skull’s history, their test methods, as well as the location of each hidden facility!\nThe chance of finding nothing lessened, and he was able to easily find the most hidden of facilities, as well as exponentially increasing the amount of Pauls.\n[How can this be... This man must be a hero sent by God to purify the Empire!]\n\"Somebody already said that before.\"\n[I was touched by your iron will. Why... Why did we cower within this dark storage house!?]\n\"Probably because there’s a giant level 5 poisonous snake lurking outside.\"\nOf course, there weren’t a lot of monsters that could threaten Lee Shin Woo and Jin in the level 2 danger zones. Because Lee Shin Woo and Jin had to split the bones they absorbed, their rate of progression had gotten a bit slow.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo trained his skills any every moment, without wasting even a second of his time, which was allowing him to progress forward.\n[Paul Zero, that’s too much for us!]\n\"Tch. Watch and learn. Paul 807.\"\n[How can this be... That’s...]\n[Lightning. It’s lightning. Lightning just came from the sky...!]\nGradually and precisely. It was less than during the time of his explosive growth, but nevertheless, everything he had absorbed and learned thus far gradually connected and fused together; they harmonized, reforming his abilities once more.\n\"Your... Your name is...!\"\n[I’m... I’m... Keuk, Kuhaaaaaaaahk!]\n\"Tch. As I thought, it doesn’t work on all of them.\"\n\"How unfortunate.\"\n\"I don’t know who you are or when you came from, but... rest in peace, Senior.\"\n[You have acquired 2 permits to God’s secret shop, and 1,275,910 Perium.]\n[You have brought peace to a comrade who had gone past the point of no return. You have satisfied a portion of the quest’s conditions, and have acquired 1 additional permit to God’s secret shop. The maximum level of Invisible Heart increases by 1.]\nPerhaps he needed an opportunity like this before. When constructing a tower, doesn’t one always have to worry about the foundation?\nBecause Lee Shin Woo had only been fighting against higher leveled foes, he was only accustomed to irregularity; in the process of killing monsters weaker than him or possessing similar abilities to him, he was able to train his abilities from the ground up and further strengthen them.\n[Silene Viesa - It’s been a long time, Senior!]\n[Lee Shin Woo - Oh, it’s a relief that you’re ok.]\n[Prince Altania - You act like he has the highest seniority around here.]\n[Silene Viesa - At the very least, I feel as though Senior Shin Woo is more experienced than you, Senior Altania.]\n[Prince Altania - What did you say!? By the way, why are you calling me by my last name when you’re calling him by his...]\n[Ye Jin Jin - Please congratulate me. I’ve finally reached level 5!]\n[Lee Shin Woo - Oh, that was really fast. Congratulations.]\n[Ye Jin Jin - Hehe...]\n[Erian Ruparte - Ha... It really does sound like Shin Woo is more experienced than Ye Jin Jin.]\n[Prince Altania - I’ve had enough of this. You guys are just outright ignoring me now!]\nAfter parting ways with the now undead Shino Rendu, they had been on the road for 2 months going through the level 2 danger zones; it had only been half a year since Lee Shin Woo had come to the Underground Empire.\nIn the meantime, Ye Jin Jin had become level 5, and another extremely talented newbie entered in after Kratia. None of the other heroes had died, and were enduring in this dangerous Empire. It was truly awkward to say that living in this awful environment that was an empire of undead was everyday life, but the other heroes were all leisurely growing.\nAnd...\n[The Intermediate Combat Sense skill has become Lv7. Agility has increased by 5.]\n[Your stats have surpassed 3,200. Your preparations are slightly, no, largely, perhaps even unbelievably perfect. It seems disrespectful to even ask if you are ready to accept your karma. Would you like to accept your karma?]\nShin Woo was finally qualified to become level 6.",

    "content": "<Chapter 23. Level 6 - 1>\n\"How unexpected.\"\n\"It turned out well, didn’t it?\"\nLee Shin Woo and Jin got off the final golem train that passed through a level 2 danger zone, and rushed into the city, clearing it of the undead, as well as exploring the sewers.\nAfter they were done fighting in the final level 2 danger zone city (there weren’t any hidden facilities), Lee Shin Woo’s Combat Sense skill leveled up, as if it were waiting for this very moment; thus, his stats had surpassed 3,200.\n\"Once we level up to 6, we can move on to the level 3 danger zones.\"\n\"...Yeah, right. It’s about time we move on. I was kind of spacing out for a bit wondering what we should do once we hit 6.\"\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo heard Jin talk about level 3 danger zones, he thought he might’ve been living comfortably for way too long.\nIt’s not like he’s been resting thus far; he was doing everything that needed to be done, yet he thought that perhaps somewhere along the way, he’d adapted to that calm and risk-free everyday life. Thɪs chapter is updated by novel-fire.net\n\"No. It’s not like we haven’t been in any sort of danger...\"\nJin thought Lee Shin Woo’s response was absurd. Though they hadn’t fought higher leveled enemies that often, they had fought more than thousands of enemies, and they had even been surrounded by level 5 elites before. Since a level 2 danger zone area wasn’t really safe for 2 level 5 heroes in the first place!\nBut the problem was that their abilities, especially Lee Shin Woo’s abilities, had grown so much that these enemies no longer posed any sort of threat to them. Didn’t the message say so? That he was more than qualified to level up.\n\"Jin, you’re still not there yet, right?\"\n\"I’m at around 2,950. I caught up quite a bit though, right?\"\n\"You caught up because I gave you most of the bones. ...In any case, I’ll level up first.\"\n\"Don’t talk like you’re leaving and not coming back.\"\nLee Shin Woo chuckled at Jin’s curt voice, and disembarked from him. They had completely cleaned up the vicinity, so there weren’t even any level 1 skeletons. There wasn’t any better place to level up.\n\"...Alright, I’ll accept all my karma now.\"\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo decided to accept his karma, blinding light burst from his body. His currently equipped equipment were released all at once, and his body began to noticeably develop!\n[You have become a level 6, Powered Elemental Bone Joker. In the pursuit of countless changes, your strengths have been maximized. Your control over nature has become more powerful and diversified; as a result, you have successfully broken free from the limitations of being a skeleton.]\n[You are no longer restrained by the title of skeleton, a low rank species. After training a variety of ways of handling bone, you have become the one and only swindler, the Bone Joker, to both yourself and to the world. All stats increase by 20. The Intermediate Mana Bone skill has become Lv8, and Magic has increased by an additional 20.]\n[All elements grow. Intermediate Fire has become Lv2, Intermediate Ice has become Lv3, Intermediate Lightning has become Lv5, and High Rank Acid has become Lv2. Magic has increased by 110.]\nSo am I a skeleton or not? Lee Shin Woo inwardly complained. While complaining, his body’s bones became larger, thicker, and glistened with mana, resulting in a whiter light than before.\nIt was truly ironic. His bones had continuously gotten darker until he turned level 4, but starting from level 5, it went in the opposite direction!\nLee Shin Woo took a look at the magic that glistened from his bones. Mana which possessed the potential to change in an infinite number of ways... that blinding and resplendent mana could harmonize no further with his Joker karma.\n[You have become able to handle mana more broadly and diversely than before. The Disguise skill has become Lv3. You can disguise yourself well with even less knowledge of your target.]\nHis growth to level 6 affected almost all of his skills and was complete. Lee Shin Woo was still an undead composed of all bone, but the harmonization of the mana that made up his bones was vastly different from before.\n\"Who the hell cares? I’m still made up of bones. Are they messing with me or what?\"\n\"Someone said you weren’t made of bones?\"\n\"No. Apparently, they’re saying I’m not a skeleton anymore.\"\n\"But you are a skeleton.\"\n\"No one’s arguing with you.\"\nLee Shin Woo complained, as if enthusiastically agreeing with Jin, and checked his status; it had been a long time since he’d checked it. Though it was true that his body had undergone some fundamental changes, he still needed to check his status.\n[Lee Shin Woo]\n[Powered Elemental Bone Joker]\n[Corps Destroyer; 4 others]\n[Lv 6 (Status effectiveness 200%)]\n[Strength - 681, Agility - 698, Health - 699, Magic - 1,380]\n[Passive skills - Acting Lv15, Invisible Heart Lv3, Rebellion Lv3, Intermediate Bursting Thunder Lv7, Intermediate Mana Bone Lv8, Intermediate Shadow Sprint Lv5, Intermediate Command Lv6, Intermediate Assimilation Lv5, Intermediate Combat Sense Lv7]\n[Active skills - Disguise Lv3, Instigate Lv2, Bone Reinforcement Lv7, Rule of Bone Lv7, Bone Armory Lv5, Intermediate Regeneration Lv8, Sacrifice Lv1, Emergency Evasion Lv4, Low Rank Twin Horn Charge Lv9]\n[Elements - Intermediate Fire Lv2, Intermediate Ice Lv3, High Rank Acid Lv2, Intermediate Lightning Lv5]\n[Resistances - Holy: MAX, Curse: MAX, Acid: High Rank Lv1, Ice: Intermediate Lv2]\n\"So I need 3,000 more stats from here to get to level 7, huh... It’s starting to feel really far off.\"\n\"You know, you said something like that when you were level 5. Moreover, you got a 200 stat increase once you hit level 6, so you’re really making a big fuss over nothing.\"\n\"The problem is that most of that stat increase is in magic.\"\nCompared to the others, only Lee Shin Woo’s magic stat increased incredibly fast. That was because most of his skills used magic as their foundation.\nBut even so, he needed his other stats as well; it was troubling for him that his magic stat was almost double that of his strength or agility stats.\n\"Hoo. No choice but to divide the bones evenly from now on. For now, you’ll take care of the magic bones.\"\n\"What!?\"\nThat wasn’t all. Another problem was that he’d only been training the skills that increased magic thus far. Of course, he didn’t really have many skills that didn’t increase magic, which was a problem, but if he looked amongst them...\n\"That’s right. There’s this.\"\n\"Ah... that.\"\nJin’s goblin fire blazed subtly, watching two horns protrude from Lee Shin Woo’s head. That’s right. It was the skill that he’d acquired from absorbing a bone from the shop: the Twin Horn Charge.\nIt was certainly a close combat skill, as it increased the force of a charge, as well as increasing attack power through the horns. Twin Horn Charge was also a skill that he’d only been able to level up by 1 these past two months as there weren’t any strong foes to use it on.\n\"Let’s get moving after I get this to the intermediate level.\"\n\"Just saying, weren’t you not using that on purpose?\"\n\"...That’s true.\"\nThere was only one reason for that. It was because Lee Shin Woo didn’t have any horns. Because of that, he couldn’t effectively make use of the Twin Horn Charge’s increase in attack power, and couldn’t hastily increase the skill’s level to the intermediate stage, causing him to worry.\n\"But I’ve been training my others skills, so I have a rough idea of how it works. Moreover, as I leveled up, my mana senses further developed as well, so it’s time I try it out.\"\nWhat were horns? They were a means to attack. And in situations where charging is required, Lee Shin Woo had the lance. In that case, the answer was simple.\n\"I just need to use the Twin Horn Charge in tandem with my lance.\"\n\"Sorry, but I don’t get it, so do what you want.\"\nJin retorted, distanced himself from Lee Shin Woo, and began to run by himself. Jin knew that studying the skill would take some time, so he’d given him some space beforehand. That was also its own type of skill training, so Lee Shin Woo didn’t stop him.\n\"Tch.\"\nIn the past, Jin would stand next to him, almost with a question mark above his skull, and genuinely listen to him, but now... Lee Shin Woo wished that Jin was like that again, and began to study, no, remodel his skill.\nHe’d already told Jin what he wanted to do: he wanted to combine the Twin Horn Charge’s horns with the lance. In other words, he would be changing the release of magic, as well as the intrinsic pattern a bit.\n’Twin Horn Charge aggressively speeds up the mana, and pushes the body in the direction of the attack. In the process, the twin horns naturally jut out. The twin horns form at the target destination that’s designated by the accelerated mana... In other words, if I’m able to change the direction of the skill to my lance, then...’\nWhen that charging technique is combined with Jin’s speed, its force would be beyond his imagination!\nLee Shin Woo was sure of himself, nodded his head, and began to study the skill immediately. He’d taken out the Drake Horn Lance simply because they were both horns; thus, he thought that maybe they could work together somehow, but there wasn’t really any meaning to it.\n\"Hey, monsters are coming! I’ll take care of them myself and come back, ok?\"\n\"Don’t forget to bring back the bones.\"\nIn a sitting position, Lee Shin Woo repeatedly activated and cancelled his skill a few times, and studied the change in mana upon the skill’s activation, as well as the flow of mana. Between these two, he would probably have to keep the change in mana the same, and control the flow of mana. However...\n’It’s not hard.’\nLee Shin Woo was quite surprised. He seemed to grasp the changes in the mana upon activation of the skill, and was likewise able to figure out how the special flow of mana was created without difficulty. The only thing left to do was to change the structure slightly, but even that was way too simple.\n’Is it because it’s still a low rank skill?’\nNo, that wasn’t the issue here. It was just Lee Shin Woo’s extraordinary ability of handling magic. While he was at it, he added another skill as well. It was Shadow Sprint, which was treated like a charging type skill.\nShadow Sprint had the special ability of adding a shadow to the charge, whilst also increasing one’s secrecy as well as their speed. It was certainly lacking in terms of destructive force. He was attempting to fill in that weakness with the Twin Horn Charge, but it wasn’t very natural to use two similar types of skills at the same time.\n’Shall we combine them?’\nThough his skills had combined with other skills on their own in the process of evolving, Lee Shin Woo had never actually tried to fuse the characteristics of two skills on his own before. It was clear by his face that the thought had never even occurred to him before.\n’But I feel like I can do it now.’\nLee Shin Woo focused on controlling his interior mana. He activated both Twin Horn Charge and Shadow Sprint simultaneously, and tied both their mana properties together. Stealthily, yet sharply. Agile, yet weighty. All of those characteristics were fused into one to create a forceful thrust...!\n\"I got all of them. Huh...?\"\n\"Hoo...\"\nJin, who easily swept away the group of level 4 monsters, saw Lee Shin Woo’s body engulfed in a dark red energy and stopped in place.\nThe two horns that burst from his head slowly receded, and a giant horn appeared on the lance in his hand, as if engulfing it. And soon, the lance was covered in a black mana, causing its form to become unclear. Even though he was staring at the lance with both of his eyes, he couldn’t tell exactly what it looked like!\n\"Shin Woo...?\"\n\"...I did it.\"\nImmediately after Jin carefully called for Lee Shin Woo, Lee Shin Woo’s eye sockets blazed with dark red goblin fire. The dark red energy that tinged the lance blended together, and covered the lance.\n[The Low Rank Twin Horn Charge skill has become Lv10 and is evolving! Absorbing the Intermediate Shadow Sprint skill. You have learned the Intermediate skill, Shadow Horn Lv1! Strength and Agility have increased by 10.]\n\"Ah, crap.\"\n\"What’s wrong? Didn’t it turn out well?\"\nBut the moment he created a skill that would overpower anyone, Lee Shin Woo lamented quietly. Jin, who couldn’t tear his eyes off the completed Shadow Horn, asked why and Lee Shin Woo sighed deeply and replied.\n\"It became a combat skill like Bursting Thunder rather than a sprint skill. It’s a skill that accelerates the speed of the thrust itself, not the charge...\"\n\"...So you focused too much of the charging force into the weapon, huh?\"\n\"Shit. I should turn it back into a charge type... forget it.\"\nLee Shin Woo could feel it instinctively. That this skill he made might actually be amazing, and with this amazing skill he might be able to grow!\nHe had succeeded in combining the two skills’ charging force, stealth, and attack power into one skill. Lee Shin Woo thought it might be better to leave the skill as is. If that’s the case, then there’s only one answer.\n\"I’m going to go visit the secret shop.\"\nAfter clearing out all the bones in the secret shop, he didn’t really feel like he needed to go there, even if he leveled up.\nHe had no choice but to find a new charging skill in God’s secret shop.",

    "content": "<Chapter 23. Level 6 - 2>\n\"Gute Nacht...[1] Congratulations on the level up. Then, sleep well.\"\n\"No wait. Please don’t lie down.\"\nPerhaps he’d come at a bad time; the merchant behind the counter, Pleine, congratulated him whilst wearing a nightgown and bent her body over the counter. Lee Shin Woo, taken aback, stopped her, and Pleine, as if expecting it, sighed and raised her head.\n\"I don’t usually take customers when I’m about to sleep...\"\n\"So you have times when you don’t take customers, huh.\"\n\"But you’re special Mr. Lee Shin Woo... Hoo.\"\nShe said, and tapped her own cheek. It was a teasing gesture, but it seemed to work, as she awoke slightly and barely opened her eyes.\n\"Thank you for the consideration.\"\n\"Haam [2]... You understand me how I feel, right?\"\nAs there was a empty wine bottle rolling atop the counter, even Lee Shin Woo, who didn’t understand women very well, could tell exactly how she felt. He was sure that she was a woman who loved her alcohol.\n\"It was such good liquor that I wanted to drink it with someone else. Would you like to drink with me? Ah, that’s right. You can’t drink it, Customer. Hehe.\"\nPleine, who was always teasing him, sounded tipsy. Lee Shin Woo felt like it would take quite a long time to do his shopping, shrugged his shoulders, and approached the counter. Pleine still looked at him with drowsy eyes and spoke.\n\"Is it urgent today?\"\n\"No. But since I used up one of my permits, I’d rather finish my business or it’d be a waste.\"\n\"Are you saying you have some time? Then... please listen to my story.\"\n\"?\"\nShe wasn’t asking him to tell her his story, but rather, she wanted him to listen to hers? What was this granny talking about? With that in mind, Lee Shin Woo looked at Pleine vacantly. It seemed like she’d understood the doubt within his goblin fire, so Pleine added on.\n\"I’ll give you a 20% discount on one item. In exchange, please don’t tell this to anyone else.\"\n\"Then please go ahead. I don’t have ears, but I’m still a really good listener.\"\nTo think she’d deduct 20% of the price off an item just by listening to her story! Lee Shin Woo knocked on his chest, as if he were ready to listen at any time, and sat down.\nPleine chuckled at Lee Shin Woo’s trustworthy figure, and opened her mouth, releasing a pink sigh.\n\"You’re fine in this regard, Mr. Lee Shin Woo, but given the opportunity, the other male customers will hit on me. You know that, right? You see, today...\"\n\"Wait a sec. Where did you just look? Where were you looking when I said you were fine!? You know that’s sexual harassment, right!?\"\n\"I suppose you can’t even sexually harass me. At any rate, that customer bought wine, drank it on the spot, and kept sticking to me; I should put up a sign saying no eating or drinking because seriously...\"\nPleine completely ignored Lee Shin Woo’s protests, and continued to speak. Pleine started with that drunk customer (Lee Shin Woo felt like he knew who she was talking about for some reason), who drank alcohol and attempted an unbecoming trick on her. She also told him about how much her usual customers pestered her, as well as the fact that she couldn’t meet with God very much and all the things she was trying to figure out, like God’s intent...\n\"It’s better above ground. Since I’m just one merchant amongst many up there. It’s just a clean, business relationship up there...\"\n\"...How is it up there?\"\n\"It’s completely unscathed. Everything is plentiful and peaceful up there, excessively so. I wonder if they’re even aware of their impending doom...\"\nShe started by talking about business, but when he thought about it, this was the perfect chance to hear about what happened on the surface, as she had a link to it. Lee Shin Woo asked her naturally.\n\"I heard that there have been times where heroes were dispatched to the surface as well.\"\n\"It’s only happened a couple of times. You should already be aware of this Mr. Shin Woo, but this curse that has completely covered the Empire... hasn’t invaded the surface yet.\"\n\"It’ll invade the surface at some point though, right?\"\n\"I believe the humans above ground won’t allow it to.\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\nThis was news to him. Lee Shin Woo’s (nonexistent) ears pricked his ears. Before she continued, Pleine brought out a new wine bottle, and immediately bit her lips. As she was beautiful, even the sight of her vigorously drinking from the bottle was quite nice.\n\"Gulp, gulp... Puu. You see, they’re overconfident in their strength. After they received the first oracle, they sent heroes down underground a few times; when they didn’t return, they just decided to seal off the underground.\"\n\"So did they succeed!?\"\n\"They thought they did at least. But no... At this rate, the curse will someday take over the surface as well. This is the price of their arrogance, and... their sin.\"\n\"Sin...\"\n\"That’s it with the bonus information. Mmm, paa...\"\nIt ended at the most exciting part. But, as Pleine could read Lee Shin Woo like a book, it didn’t seem like she’d tell him anything more about the surface. While Lee Shin Woo clicked his tongue, Pleine continued to curse at the secret shop customers.\n\"So, about the customer I had last time...\"\n\"Who’s your most handsome customer?\" Thıs content belongs to novel⁂fire.net\n\"Lloyd H.K.?\"\n\"Then what about the prettiest?\"\n\"Seira... Von Retadane.\"\nShe replied, and then nodded her head.\n\"She’s a beautiful woman, though she’s quite rude.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Hoo... I suppose it’s time I let out all the curses I’ve been holding back.\"\nPleine cursed at Seira Von Retadane for quite a long time, as if it was the right time. Pleine looked so happy as she cursed at Seira with every single word; Lee Shin Woo couldn’t even think of stopping her, and just stood still whilst listening to her. Thus, two hours passed.\n\"Oh my. It’s already this late? I’ll be going to sleep now.\"\n\"Go after you’ve sold me something.\"\n\"Tch.\"\nPleine plainly clicked her tongue. He looked at her in astonishment as she looked like she was saying ’you could’ve just let me go’. Before she played another trick on him, Lee Shin Woo cleanly and firmly spoke.\n\"Please give me the best charge type skill you have.\"\n\"A charge skill? Are you saying that you haven’t acquired a single charge skill, even though you possess the Bone Reinforcement ability, Customer? Elite monsters all have a couple of charge skills.\"\n\"I had two, but I fused them together, and it became a combat skill, rather than a charge skill.\"\n\"You fused them!? ...Just for reference, what is that skill?\"\nLee Shin Woo created the Shadow Horn with his bare hands, and showed it to Pleine. This skill was a special passive skill like Bursting Thunder, and would passively buff (faster, and stealthier) his thrust like attacks, but it was still possible to physically manifest the skill by using mana.\nBy doing so, shadows would envelop the weapon, turning it into the shape of a sharp horn, but it was also possible to activate the skill with his bare hands.\n\"...This skill. This wasn’t gifted through God’s grace, but was actually created by you, Mr. Shin Woo?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"There are some parts that are sloppy, but... this is tremendous. Divine skills that are recorded as legends are typically born this way. Like the Bursting Thunder you possess, Mr. Shin Woo.\"\nShe soon clapped her hands and made a suggestion.\n\"Would you like to reinforce this skill by adding in more skills? It’d definitely be possible with your ability, Mr. Shin Woo!\"\n\"I said I wanted a charge skill.\"\n\"I think it’d be better if you became even stealthier. In terms of power... it was originally based on horns, so I’ll go find some materials from other tough monsters. You’ll be able to extract their characteristics from them.\"\nShe had already stopped listening to Lee Shin Woo. Seeing Pleine rummage through her inventory here and there, Lee Shin Woo felt like he was out shopping with his girlfriend. Of course, he didn’t have a girlfriend.\n\"Here, I only picked out two.\"\n\"What’s this... Giant Growth. So this is where it was. Though it’s only one part of it...\"\nJust from looking at them, Lee Shin Woo could tell that the skill books Pleine had brought out were really subtle. The first was ’Intermediate Horn Giant Growth’, and the second one was ’Low Rank Shadow Extension’; just by reading the skill book names, he couldn’t help but feel that they were unclear, such that he couldn’t even describe them.\n\"The first can only be learned by those with horns, but that shouldn’t be a problem for you, Mr. Shin Woo, as you possess the Bone Reinforcement skill which can absorb anything. The second skill is also a skill that is meaningless unless you can control shadows, but this should also be no problem to you, Mr. Shin Woo.\"\nPleine stressed that there were no defects in her goods, and Lee Shin Woo’s goblin fire softly blazed.\n\"How much are they?\"\n\"Both skills are extremely subtle, but also extremely rare, so they’re quite valuable. In total, it’ll be 16 million Perium.\"\n\"You swindler.\"\n\"Since we agreed that there’d only be a 20% discount on one item!\"\nHe thought they’d gotten closer, as he’d listened to her drunk talk for 2 hours, yet it seemed like she would only allow the discount on one item.\nAs expected, he couldn’t take this merchant lightly. If he had his wish, he would’ve just asked for a charge skill, taken it, and then gone home, but...\n\"Don’t you feel it? That you can strengthen the Shadow Horn skill significantly with these skills!?\"\n\"...Ugh.\"\nShe was right. As expected of an outstanding merchant; Pleine had brought out items that Lee Shin Woo really wanted to buy.\nHorn Giant Growth would increase the destructive power of his horns by increasing their size, and was a truly simple skill that was effective in an extremely limited range. On the other hand, he didn’t know how effective the other skill would be, as it would disperse shadows and confuse his opponents. However, if he applied Shadow Extension to Shadow Horn, he would be able to create quite the diverse skill...\n\"Ugh...\"\nBecause he’d gained so much money from going around the Empire, especially from cutting down the Forest of the Dryads, he had enough money to buy both skill books. He possessed 57.52 million Perium. It wasn’t an easy sum to acquire for even the level 6 heroes who had been in the Empire for a few years.\nHowever, perhaps she’d expected that as well. No, was her story for two hours also a way to lower his decision making ability!?\n\"...Probably not, but I’ll take them.\"\n\"I love you, Customer!\"\nPleine smiled beamingly, and Lee Shin Woo sighed as he accepted the skill books. He immediately learned the two skills. Pleine gazed at him with wide eyes.\n\"You’re not going to try it out right away?\"\n\"I’m not a genius, you know. I’ll attempt it after I’ve studied both of the skills.\"\n\"I feel like the fact that you were even able to fuse two skills together makes you a genius... Here, this is the charge skill you were looking for. You’ll probably like it.\"\nPerhaps she had prepared it beforehand, as she placed a book onto the table without delay.\nIt looked a lot different from all the other skill books he’d found or bought before. The edges of the book were decorated in gold, yet the cover of the book was in tatters.\n\"This is... Keuk?’\nThe moment he stretched his hand towards the skill book, the book emitted sparks that flickered across Lee Shin Woo’s hand. It was powerful lightning! The glitter in Lee Shin Woo’s eyes changed as he gazed upon the book. Pleine spoke with a satisfied expression.\n\"Spirit Arts - Lightning Sprint. It’s a high rank skill, but... I believe you should be able to use this skill, even without the help of spirits, Mr. Shin Woo. What do you think?\"\n\"I really like it. How much is it?\"\nPleine smiled brightly. Seeing that smile, Lee Shin Woo felt slightly uneasy.\n\"With a 20% discount, it costs a clean 41.5 million Perium, Customer!\"\n[1] T/N: Good night in German.\n[2] T/N: Yawning sound.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 23 part3",
    "content": "<Chapter 23. Level 6 - 3>\n\"She got me again...\"\n\"Why did you come back so late... What’s wrong with you?\"\nJin looked at Lee Shin Woo oddly, who’d just returned after being completely robbed at the secret shop. He wondered whether he should tell Jin that he’d been caught up in Pleine’s business acumen and only had 20,000 Perium left, but decided against it.\n\"Did you get a charge skill?\"\n\"I was able to get a good one.\"\n\"That’s a relief... But wait, why were you late in the first place?\"\nJin was extremely curious, but Lee Shin Woo didn’t tell him the details. That’s because he had promised Pleine that he wouldn’t tell anyone else what they’d discussed.\nTherefore, when Jin suggested that they practice the charge skill together, Lee Shin Woo shook his head, saying no to that as well.\n\"Let’s try it after I gain Lightning Resistance.\"\n\"Lightning Resistance!?\" Read complete versıon only at novel·fire·net\n\"It’s a good skill, but I didn’t think it’d have that kind of a problem when I bought it... No, I’d probably still have bought it even if I knew about it beforehand.\"\nAfter paying a sum total of 41.5 million Perium, he’d learned the high rank skill, Lightning Sprint, which would wrap the entire body in lightning and charge with an impressive speed and destructive force; a wild skill.\nOrdinarily, the skill could only be used when one is contracted to a lightning spirit, but Lee Shin Woo was able to use the skill without any problems, as he could create lightning by himself. It also had a high compatibility with Bursting Thunder as well.\n\"High rank skills aren’t often sold in the shop, but when they are, they’re sold immediately. But it seems like this one hadn’t been sold because of the troublesome conditions.\"\n\"You’re saying that you’ve satisfied all the conditions, but you can’t use it because of me, huh...\"\nThere was no way the lightning would inflict damage on its caster, but the problem was Jin. Because it would create such intense lightning, befitting its high ranking, he couldn’t use it before Jin learned at least intermediate lightning resistance. If he himself possessed lightning resistance, he would be able to share it with Jin, but he didn’t have it.\n\"I could also just not ride on your back and use it, but that’s pretty pointless.\"\n\"That’s true.\"\nThe reason Lee Shin Woo’s charge attacks possessed such destructive force was because of Jin’s formidable speed and reaction time. He couldn’t match it, even with a high rank skill.\n\"They don’t sell lightning resistance in the shop?\"\n\"It’s not just lightning. They don’t sell any resistances. I didn’t really know, but apparently resistances are really amazing.’\n\"Ah, yeah. That sounds about right...\"\nThere was the problem of obtaining the resistance, but there was also the issue of training it. Resistances level up when one is heavily damaged by an element, but most people weren’t stupid enough to continuously put themselves in that kind of situation... Even if one possessed resistances, low rank to intermediate would probably be the max for them.\n\"But that means that you can’t use that charge skill of yours.\"\n\"I guess we have no choice but to substitute it with your skill and Shadow Horn for now...\"\nThough he spent pretty much all his money to buy these three skills, he couldn’t even use a single one of them immediately! It felt as though he’d been robbed, but he’d already learned the skills, so he couldn’t get a refund. Jin threw something out there.\n\"Why did you even go to the shop again?\"\n\"It hurts enough without you reminding me, so could you lay off?\"\nLee Shin Woo, who’d been hurt both physically and mentally, travelled to the closest golem train station. There were only two trains that went to level 3 danger zones, located in either the western or eastern part of the Empire.\nThey were areas he couldn’t have even imagined going to when he first rode on the train, but now they had to go to at least level 3 danger zones to grow. They would’ve moved on to the level 3 danger zones earlier had it not been for the Paul expansion plan.\n\"When I look back, we’ve travelled through about 60% of the Empire in a few months.\"\n\"But the tough part starts now.\"\nAfter they’d heard an explanation regarding the concept of ’danger zones’, a few months had passed, yet nothing changed amongst the other heroes. Most of them were still residing near the level 3 danger zone satellite cities that were connected with the large cities.\nApparently, they would only be able to see level 6 or level 7s in level 4 or higher danger zones; so it could be said that Lee Shin Woo and Jin’s experiences were just a taste of what is to come. Their adventure, as well as their Bone Reinforcement had just begun.\n\"Level 7 elites... Bones that are tasty and good for you...\"\n\"Man, you’re already starting to talk about that?\"\nThis wasn’t the first time that he’d looked at Lee Shin Woo and thought, ’I guess I’m going to die this time’, but it seemed as though that time was actually quickly approaching this time. Even after he’d seen firsthand that Shino Rendu had died after invading a satellite city, Lee Shin Woo was still ready to attack it!\n\"Even I won’t do something as stupid as Shino Rendu. Yeah, I’m going to attack the city, but I’m going to get out quickly too.\"\n\"So in other words, you’re going to invade the city and then rely on my mobility.\"\n\"You noticed that? You really are the best partner.\"\n\"Yeah, though you don’t have any of that sense.\"\n\"Who, me?\"\nWhilst conversing with Lee Shin Woo, Jin had become uneasy, and checked how many Blessings of Death he’d accumulated.\nBecause of Lee Shin Woo’s instruction, Jin was better able to absorb the surrounding curse and had accumulated nine lives. However, he was still concerned whether or not this was enough.\n\"The speed at which your Blessing of Death stockpiles will increase from now on as well.\"\n\"We’re going to a place really close to death, aren’t we...?\"\nThe two arrived at the train station and unhesitatingly rode the train. They were now used to the sudden acceleration, and Lee Shin Woo was no longer weak enough to fall from its speed. Lee Shin Woo had realized just how much he’d grown from such an unexpected source.\nHowever, the moment the train stopped and they got off and onto the platform, Lee Shin Woo felt a powerful but familiar wave of mana. He tilted his head, and instinctually hid his mana.\n\"Huh?\"\n[It’s been a while, Paul Zero.]\nIn the center of the platform where all nine trains were on standby, they saw Guillotine Steelworker, someone they hadn’t seen since being given authorization to use the trains. It seemed as though he’d confirmed that the train had entered the platform and had come directly over.\n\"It’s been a long time... Were you waiting for us?\"\n[That’s right.]\nGuillotine looked quite serious, causing Lee Shin Woo to inwardly feel quite uneasy, yet he maintained a calm expression. To be honest, the only thing he needed to do was keep his goblin fire blazing at a steady rate.\n\"But we haven’t been causing much trouble lately.\"\n[You’re right. You’ve also been disposing of the low rank golems for us... I was thinking about spying on you, but I chose not to. I wasn’t waiting to interrogate you.]\n\"Then, do you have a request?\"\n[You’re really quick on the uptake, you rascal.]\nGuillotine sported a bitter smile at Lee Shin Woo’s words. Despite being a golem, the way the skin on his face moved was truly sensitive. And when he thought about it, he was also jealous of his natural hair. It wouldn’t get like that through hair transplantation. I hope you lose all your hair!\n[You should already have some idea, but we’ve been keeping an eye on you whenever you’ve come and gone from this place. Since we had no choice but to be suspicious.]\n\"So what’s your request...?\"\n[Yeah. We’re not as suspicious of you as we once were. At the very least, we’re sure that you’re not one of the Emperor’s men.]\n\"I told you that at the beginning, didn’t I?\"\n[Haha.]\nThey both knew, whether it be the uncomfortably speaking Lee Shin Woo or the awkwardly smiling Guillotine. That they couldn’t truly trust one another. But they could agree that they ’wouldn’t act to harm the other’. It had taken this much time to reach that conclusion.\n[Like you said, I have a request for you. It may be difficult for you, as you’re level 5, but it should be possible with the help of your group.]\nLee Shin Woo’s eyes gleamed for two reasons. Firstly, Guillotine didn’t get his level right. That meant that Lee Shin Woo was concealing his mana from a higher leveled individual.\nAnd secondly...\n\"I don’t have a group backing me though.\"\n[Let’s leave it at that.]\nLee Shin Woo only inwardly smiled bitterly at Guillotine’s reply.\nAt the time, Lee Shin Woo had told him that both he and Jin were the result of their test, and that only they were the survivors of the test; but so long as the golems weren’t idiots, there was no way they’d just trust him. It was obvious that they’d assume that there were others backing Lee Shin Woo and Jin.\nAnd from the very beginning, that was what Lee Shin Woo was aiming for.\n’A small lie is exposed when trying to hide a larger lie. In order for them to believe my lie that Jin and I were the only survivors of the test, I clumsily acted like I was hiding the fact that there was a group behind me. And they focused on that...’\nThus, they thought of Lee Shin Woo as some sort of secret agent for some unknown group. Just like he had planned.\n’Doesn’t it hurt your head to always be thinking so complicatedly?’\n’Surprise. I don’t even have a brain!’\nLee Shin Woo and Jin exchanged trifling jokes through their connection, and Guillotine Steelworker went to the main point. As expected, he had quite a serious tone.\n[Do you remember what the General told you last time... regarding our creation?]\n\"Of course I remember.\"\n[Good. Then that quickens things. At the time, the Emperor sacrificed promising knights for his own protection. The Golden Army was established with 500 members, but thousands were sacrificed in order to make that 500.]\n\"Thousands...\"\n[So what would’ve happened to the thousands of knights sacrificed? They were discarded. In order to conceal how wicked the Emperor was, the testing facilities were completely buried.]\n\"...No way.\"\nLee Shin Woo momentarily froze at an awful thought that came up. Guillotine Steelworker nodded his head calmly.\n[It’s probably as you’ve imagined. They likely were resurrected and became undead. We made a mistake; we should’ve cremated them, but we didn’t...]\n\"That’s... I ended up hearing something that puts a bad taste in my mouth.\"\n[If I could, I would take care of it myself, but... the day following the curse, the General forbid any of us from going outside. That’s why I’d like you to do it in my place.]\n\"Huh?\"\nHe spoke as if it were completely unrelated to him, but the conversation ended up going back to him. Lee Shin Woo’s goblin fire narrowed. Guillotine Steelworker continued.\n[It’s time for them to rest. I hope that you’ll let them rest in peace in our place. I’ll tell you where they are. It’s near the satellite city, Kadinan. You’ll be right there if you take that train.]\n\"Is that all?\"\n[Of course.]\nLee Shin Woo momentarily didn’t respond to Guillotine’s unnecessarily brisk response and acted as though he were thinking about it, but... like always, he made his decision right away.\n\"Fine. I’ll take up your request. There’s a reward, right?\"\n[If you return, I’ll give you something beyond your expectations. I promise, as Guillotine Steelworker, one of the Four Commanders.]\nConsidering that he called himself one of the Four Commanders, there must be three other level 7 golems aside from Guillotine. Lee Shin Woo roughly nodded his head at Guillotine’s confident declaration. Though Jin looked like he was feeling uneasy, Lee Shin Woo just ignored him.\n\"Then I trust you’ll keep your promise and go immediately.\"\n[Good luck.]\nGuillotine, who was worried that Lee Shin Woo would ask some more questions, saw Lee Shin Woo accept his request unhesitatingly and immediately get on the train. Once they were inside, he smiled without them knowing.\nThe train soon departed. Guillotine was the only one remaining and turned around, but suddenly, he heard a dignified voice from within his head. It was Arema Steelworker’s voice.\n[Guillotine, I believe that was an order I gave to you.]\n[I wanted to reduce our casualties. Moreover, there’s reports that the other generals are getting more involved now, so I thought that we’d be discovered if we went outside, no matter how careful we were.]\n[But if they were to discover the facility...]\n[Even if they were to find it, they don’t have the right to enter it.]\nArema hesitated once he heard Guillotine, and Guillotine continued to press.\n[Paul Zero only possesses general administrative authority. Unless you’re a golem, one cannot possess an authority any higher than that. Isn’t that what you said, Sir Arema?]\n[... It’s plenty surprising already that he acquired a general administrative authority from just studying a golem. That’s why I originally thought he was one of the Emperor’s men.]\n[Indeed, it is surprising. It’s something we need to pay attention to. Thus, if he were to come back safely after completing the task, I’m planning on watching him through hidden surveillance. This task was a good excuse to give him that.]\n[...Mm...]\nArema, who had been pondering, was persuaded by Guillotine and looked favorably upon his plan.\n[Fine. I entrusted you with this, so do as you please. But you have to take responsibility for it as well.]\n[I’ll keep that in mind, my lord.]\nAs soon as Arema Steelworker’s voice, which took hold of both his mind and body disappeared, Guillotine instinctually ended up sighing.\nThen, he walked over to the production facility in order to create a Surveillance Unit Zero to give to Lee Shin Woo.",

    "content": "<Chapter 23. Level 6 - 4>\n\"What could possibly be hidden for him to act like that? Are they trying to kill me? If not, then are they trying to use me to provoke someone?\"\nBut unfortunately for Guillotine, Lee Shin Woo didn’t trust his words at all. He spoke, once he got off the golem train and stepped into a new area.\n\"Shin Woo, can’t you try trusting in people some more?\"\n\"It’s not between people; it’s between a skeleton and a golem. The genre’s completely different, so what’s the point?\"\n\"...\"\nEven as Lee Shin Woo spoke, he activated the administrative seal naturally, like flowing water, and came into ownership of the abandoned golems on standby in the production facility. He’d already become quite familiar with the process, as he’d done this several times already.\n[In honor of Steelworker.]\n[I will protect you with my life.]\n\"Yeah, yeah. Oh, it’s a level 5 one!\"\n[I am an Iron Golem. I will protect you, Steelworker.]\n[I will protect you as well.]\n\"It’s not just one!\"\nAs he’d roamed the Empire, Lee Shin Woo had a rough idea as to the value of golems. Firstly, level 3 Stone Golems were pretty much worthless to him, while the level 4 Bronze Golems were normally quite strong. However, they were pretty pointless once he surpassed the level 2 danger zones.\nHowever, it’s different when referring to the Iron Golems, which were level 5 elites. They’re definitely the ’bully’ of the level 2 danger zones! They would probably be useful, even in the level 3 danger zones with their level of durability and power.\n\"But I haven’t found any golems that are a level higher than them...\"\n\"They’re probably in those rooms that they didn’t let us in, right?\"\n\"There might be some of those golems in the level 3 danger zones already.\"\n\"Yeah, there’s a high chance of that.\"\nThe two chattered on whilst Lee Shin Woo lead the golems outside. There were five golems standing by in the underground facilities, with another five outside as well; so in total, there were 10 Iron Golems by their side.\n[Waiting for your orders, Steelworker.]\n[It’s an honor to be guarding you, Steelworker.]\n[Command us.]\n\"They’re quite loyal...\"\n\"Mm, so Arema Steelworker doesn’t really care about the level 5 Iron Golems, huh...\"\n\"Huh? That’s what this means?\"\n\"Look. There are Iron Golems right outside the train underground even without us going above ground, so they didn’t bother picking them up. That means that these Iron Golems hold no value to Arema Steelworker.\"\nThe fact that Arema Steelworker sent them on their way on the train, despite knowing that there were Iron Golems there meant that he considered these Iron Golems trash ’yet to be disposed of’.\nHowever, Arema treasured the level 6 golems. Lee Shin Woo and Jin were able to roughly estimate the level of the golems in the areas where they weren’t permitted to enter.\nHe didn’t care about the level 5 golems, but he did care about the level 6 ones. There was one thing that suggested as such.\n\"He has no way of creating cores. If he were able to create cores, he would’ve collected the level 5 golems, and even the level 4s and taken them apart. And would’ve created more level 6s, but the fact that he didn’t means that...\"\n\"Ah, you’re probably right.\"\nThe Iron Golems’ cores were high-class, and were very similar to the Original Core. Honestly, Lee Shin Woo was confident that he would be able to make an Original Bone Core with just four or five of them. However, Arema Steelworker was leaving those Iron Golems alone.\n\"...I wonder what Arema Steelworker is thinking about? What does he intend to do? Why did he send us here?\"\n\"I wonder. ...I suppose that’s for us to find out.\"\nIf there were one thing he was sure about, it would be that Arema Steelworker made a huge mistake; he hadn’t taken into account Lee Shin Woo’s latent potential and had thoughtlessly revealed his secrets. It didn’t take long for Lee Shin Woo to come to that conclusion.\n\"You guys go back. If we keep going like this, we should be able to reach the level 2 danger zone without any danger.\"\n[As you command, Steelworker.]\n[I will follow your command, by working together with my comrades.]\nThough he’d just gotten command over the group of golems, Lee Shin Woo sent the golems away in the next moment. To be exact, he’d sent them to the designated gathering place for his troops in the level 2 danger zone.\n\"Go to the meeting place as soon as possible, but if you think there’s any danger to your cores, run away and take a detour immediately. If you can’t escape, collect your comrades’ cores and keep them with you. Remember that.\"\n[I understand!]\n[Thank you for taking us into consideration, Steelworker.]\nOnce they grouped up with the other golems, their mission would be to roam around the Empire, collecting information and hunting monsters.\nIf they don’t overdo it, such that they don’t incur casualties and cut down the number of undead, they would help in gradually, very gradually purifying the Empire. If they worked together, they would at worst be as effective as 1 hero.\n\"Unlike the Pauls, the Golems can’t grow.\"\n\"But the bones that they collect can be used to reinforce the Pauls, right? Moreover, there’s something else I’m thinking about, too.\"\nLee Shin Woo sent the golems, which departed for their long journey, off with a delighted smile. Lee Shin Woo had frantically picked up the Iron Golems while Arema Steelworker had thrown them away and considered them useless. From the outside, it clearly seemed like a completely one-sided superior and subordinate relationship, but it was strange, as it felt like if it were Lee Shin Woo, it might be different.\n\"Then, shall we get going, secretly?\"\n\"How? You don’t have Shadow Sprint anymore.\"\n\"Ah, that’s right.\"\nAt the beginning, Lee Shin Woo thought he’d be able to change skills as he wanted like how he could so naturally change mana as he wished, but he couldn’t. If it were that easy, they wouldn’t be skills. If it had a particular element to it, then he might’ve been able to recreate it, but the ’Shadow’ element didn’t exist in this world.\n\"Whenever I try, I just keep making Shadow Horns. Damn it...\"\n\"It can’t be helped. If we need to, we can just run away. Let’s go.\"\n\"Sseup...\"\nLike with all of the golem production facilities, their destination was in the highlands, northwest a ways away from the center of the Empire. When they looked down, they saw the satellite city that Guillotine had told them about, Kadinan.\nHe inwardly thought that this city might’ve been cleared out by the other heroes, but considering the abundance of mana he felt, it meant that the undead were still stationed inside the city.\n\"Is the lord about level 6? Level 6...\"\n\"Don’t smack your lips. Yeah we’re going to charge in, but now’s not the time, right?\"\n\"You’re right. First, we...\"\nHe didn’t know if it was done on purpose, but the golem testing facility was quite a ways off from the production facility. Kadinan was at the center, and the testing facility was at a place that they could only reach by departing from the highlands and going all the way around.\nKadinan was like a basin, and the testing facility and the highlands all felt like a part of the enclosing mountain range.\n\"It’s really strange. How did they make this kind of natural environment underground...\"\n\"You know, if the Emperor’s this good at magic, to the point that he’s able to do something like this, then isn’t it pretty much guaranteed we’d lose?\"\n\"...It’s not the result of some transient magic. Let’s go with the idea that he’s stockpiled power over many years.\"\nThey chattered on like usual, but as they travelled, Lee Shin Woo’s expression stiffened unexpectedly. Dıscover more novels at novel✦fire.net\n\"They’ve way too many patrols.\"\n\"We’ve already gone past a lot of patrols thus far. What’s wrong with you all of a sudden?\"\n\"No, I’m saying... that there’re way too many people patrolling around our destination.\"\n\"...\"\nHe’d thought it unusual, but it seemed like they already took notice of them. Lee Shin Woo was dumbfounded.\nDid Guillotine look down on him? If not, then was he not truly aware of what was going on around here? Either way, it didn’t matter. Lee Shin Woo was starting to become curious as to what lay at his destination.\n[Hey you, stay there.]\nIt wasn’t very long before Lee Shin Woo was discovered by one of the patrolling Skeleton Knights. Since he didn’t even have Shadow Sprint, it was impossible for him to move without being discovered. However, both Lee Shin Woo and Jin looked relaxed.\n[Woah!? W-What a nice horse!]\n\"My thanks for the compliment. Are you a knight under the lord’s command?\"\nNine times out of ten, someone who doesn’t recognize him would say something like this.\n[T-That’s correct. If it’s not too much trouble, may I ask where you came from...?]\nEven after dying, knights and aristocrats were idiots and still respected ranks of power! Regardless of how suspicious he might’ve looked, he wouldn’t be able to treat him so thoughtlessly!\nMoreover, Lee Shin Woo was currently garbed in luxurious armor (he purposely kept his helmet open so that others could see that he was undead) and spoke gallantly (for someone who can’t even breathe, Jin acted as if he could and drew out his breaths).\nThe knight couldn’t help but wonder about his identity!\n\"I am one of Marquis Satepen’s men.\"\n[One of Marquis Satepen’s men!?]\nMarquis Satepen was the lord with the highest standing amongst the lords that controlled the level 2 danger zone cities!\nHe had retired to the countryside after passing his land over to his son, and he was sure of the family’s power and position; Lee Shin Woo had cleaved his skull and absorbed his bone, so he was able to nigh-perfectly imitate him, but he was purposefully posing as his knight instead!\n\"You know of these unruly and strange individuals moving around throughout the Empire, yes? The Marquis was quite worried about this, so he sent me and some other knights throughout the Empire. Thus, it is my duty to capture and torture these flies, and report back to the Marquis.\"\n[As expected... As expected of Marquis Satepen! A noble loyal to the Empire, even after passing his position to his son!]\n\"Thus... What are you all doing within? I have already discovered quite a few knights patrolling around.\"\n[T-That’s...]\nThe Skeleton Knight was flustered and stepped back. He had already accepted that Lee Shin Woo was Satepen’s vassal! But if he was too forceful, the knight may become angry with him, so Lee Shin Woo purposefully made his voice less forceful.\n\"As a mere knight, I have no plans of interfering with the lord’s work. We are all loyal to the Empire, are we not? I just asked out of concern, so there is no need to be alarmed.\"\n[Ha, haha. Thank you for your consideration. Ah, what is your name...?]\n\"You can call me Seta.\"\n[Sir Seta, it wasn’t something that I couldn’t tell you, as you’re under orders from Marquis Satepen. To be honest, the lord received an imperial command.]\n\"Hoh.\"\nHe even told him about the imperial command; seriously, dumbasses like this are the best!\n[This is what the Emperor commanded. Rebels will definitely appear here, so if anyone suspicious comes, then we should report immediately. Then, one of the 12 generals will come and personally execute the rebels...!]\n\"Is that so?\"\nLee Shin Woo completely understood now. For some reason, the Emperor was sure that Arema Steelworker would appear here, and Arema Steelworker was also aware of the Emperor’s motives.\n’If I thoughtlessly entered, then around the time I exited the dungeon, one of the 12 generals would be there to meet me.’\nWas Arema’s plan to get rid of him? No, if it was, he would’ve just told Guillotine to kill him. In other words... it was a test. It was a test for Lee Shin Woo, as well as his group (Arema trusted that a group backing him existed), so Arema could gauge their abilities.\n’There could be something else as well, but this is probably it for now.’\nHe could just figure out the rest starting now. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and spoke.\n\"So you were following the imperial command. If it is not too much trouble, may I help as well? I will go and talk to the lord personally.\"\n[Ooooh, it would be a great help [1] to us if you were to assist us, Sir Seta! I will personally guide you to the lord!]\nThe deeply touched knight yelled! Jin, who had heard it all, inwardly cried out.\n’What the hell are you doing!?’\n’I mean, if we just barge in, one of the 12 generals will show up soon. Even so, we can’t just go back. I’m too curious as to what’s going on in there.’\n’So!?’\n’So henceforth, we’re beginning operation [Operation: Bro [2], why are you there?’]!’\n’...You.’\nThere were so many parts about that statement he wanted to retort about, but Jin decided to concentrate on only the one he was truly confident about. The two ’operation’ words were overlapping! [3]\n[1] T/N: In Korean, he says something along the lines of saying that he’s similar to a force of a thousand. It’s just a saying that emphasizes how helpful he would be.\n[2] T/N: Hyung, or big brother. As it’s comical, ’bro’ is the more contextually correct English translation.\n[3] T/N: The first operation uses the Korean word, while the second uses the English pronunciation spelled out in Korean.",

    "content": "<Chapter 24. Operation - Bro, why are you there? - 1>\n[As expected... Impressive, very impressive.]\n\"You’re too kind.\"\nLee Shin Woo was meeting with Count (or who used to be) Nellopa, the lord of the satellite city, Kadinan in a reception room. He was like a mummy who was all skin and bones, and according to Lee Shin Woo’s assessment, his name showed up as [Lv6 Undead Commander].\nHe was already well aware that the higher leveled the undead, the more likely they were to not be bound by the form of a mere skeleton or zombie, so he wasn’t very surprised by it. At the same time, he could easily tell that the lord’s intellect... was higher than a normal undead as well.\n[Ahem... Is Marquis Setapen... doing well?]\n\"I have not been in contact with him, as it has been some time since he left his estate, but there are trustworthy knights by his side.\"\n[Marquis Setapen’s knights... are renowned for their valor. Indeed. I had thought he would pass on all of his forces along with his estate, but to think that he had kept people like you by his side; what a sly old fox... Ahem, he’s a powerful man.]\nThe undead were truly mysterious. Even if the undead possessed a similar level of intellect, when thrust into a combat scenario, several undead recklessly threw themselves into the fight; on the other hand, if they met other undead, and remembered their status when they were alive, they would act the part.\nThere was an extremely thin line between insanity and normalcy for them; only by understanding and arbitrating between that line would one be able to command them. For the past half year, Lee Shin Woo had encountered countless undead and had roughly been able to ascertain how to do this.\n[But... is it really alright for you to help us?]\n\"The Empire is in danger. Must I say anything else?\"\n[Hmm... You’re right. Absolutely right. You truly are extraordinary!]\nThat sense that allowed him to turn the conversation to the present situation, regardless of what the other was saying! He didn’t know how he felt about Marquis Setapen, but now wasn’t the time for Lee Shin Woo to be worrying about something like that!\nAs he thought, because of his statement advocating their cause, the Undead Commander, Count Nellopa nodded his head in satisfaction.\n[Then, could I ask you to do something? Since surveillance has been tough with just the knights we have.]\n\"Of course. Please do.\"\nAnd thus, Lee Shin Woo much too casually and successfully infiltrated the city, Kadinan. The lord didn’t call one of the 12 generals, Lee Shin Woo had entered the city, and they got the opportunity to scout out the area all at once.\nJin was speechless as he saw Lee Shin Woo march out of the reception area (as Jin obviously couldn’t go in), where the level 6 undead lord, the Knight Leader (a level 5 Elder Knight), as well as undead wizards resided.\n’You’re really...’\n’Nice. Then, shall we begin?’\nNow, operation ’Bro, why are you there?’ had begun in earnest! Lee Shin Woo volunteered to patrol the outskirts so that he would avoid the lord’s suspicion; he pricked his ears and activated his mana senses, and then began patrolling his allotted area.\n[Sir Seta. Thank you for all your hard work!]\n\"You’re working hard as well. Are you on your way back from patrolling?\"\n[That’s correct. I was patrolling an important, protected area. Hundreds of knights go through dozens of routes in order to patrol so that there’s no gap in our defenses.]\n\"Impressive.\"\nAnd in the process, Lee Shin Woo got closer to the other knights, and obviously acquired some information as well. For reference, they were telling him about the protected area; all the knights that had participated in human testing were buried there.\n[Your horse is quite splendid, Sir Seta.]\n\"Haha, thanks. You’re a full-fledged knight as well; don’t you have a horse as well?\"\n[That’s... For some reason, all of the living horses in the city died. There are countless knights in the city without a horse.] Newest update provıded by NoveIꜰire.net\nTo think that all of the horses had died. There should only be dead horses in the Empire by now... is what he thought, yet Lee Shin Woo didn’t utter those words.\n\"How unfortunate. If I have the chance, I’ll find a good horse for you.\"\n[Thank you very much!]\n’There’re two over here. And it looks like they’re the only three disguised on the western outskirts, but there’s actually one more hiding there as well.’\nThough they were all undead, the dead in Kadinan, and especially the knights, trusted Lee Shin Woo, as he emphasized loyalty to the Empire. The most important virtue for a knight within the Empire was strength, while the second most important virtue was loyalty.\n\"Hmm. It seems that the north side’s defense isn’t up to par. Shouldn’t we adjust the patrol route a bit?\"\nMoreover, Lee Shin Woo made it seem like he was concerned about the defense of the city and their patrols while in actuality, he was fishing for information; he acted like he actually had some ’recommendations’ for them, so the undead didn’t even suspect Lee Shin Woo in the slightest. There was no way for them to be suspicious of him.\n[You truly are perceptive, Sir Seta. However, there’s a hidden magic trap over there, so...]\n\"As I suspected. As I thought, Kadinan is truly an impressive city.\"\n’Ok. I wondered if they knew about it, but it seems like these guys really don’t know that their magic trap is broken and still think it’s working... If that’s the case, then I can say that there’re really no reserve troops over there.’\nLee Shin Woo enthusiastically continued patrolling and collecting information; as a result, he figured out their patrol routes, the scope of the patrol, when they changed shifts, and even the route by which they were deployed and returned. It only took him a couple of days to successfully figure this all out, and organized the information in his head such that it was much simpler.\n\"Good. Then we should...\"\n\"How the hell did you get such detailed information!?\"\nJin, who had definitely been with Lee Shin Woo at every moment, watched as Lee Shin Woo organized the information on paper. He started with the outskirts and their complicated patrolling routes. Once he saw Lee Shin Woo detailing where and when the knights were stationed at each and every moment, he couldn’t understand how he had come up with it all. However, once he looked over the details, he couldn’t deny that it looked accurate.\n\"This is way too easy. We can already infiltrate the facility, huh?\"\n\"...Then let’s get rid of that operation or whatever you call it, and just go for the facility right now.\"\n\"But think about it, Jin. Do you really think all they’re doing is patrolling the area with some knights? Especially when they’re so protective of this place? Even when they have a way to communicate with the 12 generals in place?\"\n\"Then?\"\nThere was a single level 6 magician along with several level 5 magicians in the city. Above all, Lee Shin Woo was most wary of the magicians, whose ability was to change mana to enact miracles; he had no idea what they could do!\nLee Shin Woo was sure that they were involved in all this, so he couldn’t move in haste and make a mistake that shows any sort of weakness. Rather, now was most important!\n[Ah, Sir Seta. Thank you for all your hard work!]\n[Sir Seta, please rest well!]\n\"You guys worked hard, too. Good work.\"\n’One would think that you were born as an aristocrat.’\nLee Shin Woo, who’d completely explored the outskirts in only two days, was off duty, and after changing shifts with other knights, observed the magicians’ movements in a way that wouldn’t arouse suspicion, whilst also searching for the ’hot line’ that he assumed allowed the lord to communicate with the 12 generals.\nIn order to do so, he would need to get closer to the lord.\n\"My lord, it is I, Sir Seta.\"\n[Ooh, Sir Seta. Have you been comfortable here?]\n\"Yes. I am quite comfortable due to your consideration.\"\nThough that ’consideration’ only really included accommodations outside where he could keep his horse, that was more than enough for Lee Shin Woo.\nThe location of his accommodations was also excellent. Though he could inspect the outside from the inside, the same couldn’t be said of the reverse; in order to watch their movements, one would have to get within a certain distance, which was especially pleasing to Lee Shin Woo.\n[Then, what have you come for? ...If you wanted to ask about the imperial command, I apologize, but I can’t tell you much. It’s not because I can’t trust you. It’s quite sensitive information, so please understand.]\n\"Ah. Please don’t apologize. I don’t have the authority to ask for such information. Rather... if it’s alright with you, my lord, I could take over some of the patrols in the inner city that have been ignored as a result of the knights following the imperial command.\"\nAnnouncing his intention to break away from the main task at hand, upholding the imperial command, meant that, in other words, Lee Shin Woo really wanted to help, but he wasn’t really interested in detailed information!\n[Mm, you truly are...]\nThe lord was slightly moved by his words. This man was genuinely trying to help him! He was acting loyally to the Emperor, without any suspicions or putting up any fronts! To think that there was still a knight like this in the Empire...!\n’Of course, I’ve already explored as much as I could on the outside, so now it’s time I look inside as well.’\nSeeing the Undead Commander, who was completely moved by him, Lee Shin Woo inwardly smiled a rotten smile. If Jin was with him, he would be shocked by how the meaning of words changed based on how one said them.\n[If that’s really what you want, then... then can you do it for me? This is also a part of upholding the imperial command.]\n\"The more important the mission, the more one must focus on the task. My lord, you are the one who was issued the imperial command. Does that not mean that your safety is paramount, my lord?\"\n[Indeed. Marquis Setapen must’ve felt reassured having you by his side. Hohoho!]\nThough it was a special situation because he was upholding the imperial command, Lee Shin Woo was much too easily able to gain access to the inner city. Since most of the knights were assigned to the mission area, Lee Shin Woo could move freely through the inner city.\nOf course, because he didn’t know who was watching and where, he kept up the facade of a truly earnest guard. He wasn’t even this perfect when he was in the army and assigned to a guard post.\n\"How is it over there?\"\n[Jin Taylor - There are magicians above the walls, but they’re not really doing anything special.]\n\"Move around and look for places that have an excessive concentration of mana, or check if they make any sort of suspicious hand gestures.\"\n[Jin Taylor - Ok, I got it.]\nIf he’s going to search the inner city, then Jin would be responsible for exploring the outskirts. Lee Shin Woo asked if it was ok if Jin could move around, since he would be bored being tied down. The lord readily nodded, stating that so long as Jin didn’t cause a fuss, there was no reason that his horse couldn’t move around freely.\nAnd that was really a mistake. Of course, it wasn’t easy to figure out that Jin was an undead horse, let alone a hero, especially when the other heroes couldn’t easily figure it out either!\n’There are quite a few magicians, but there are a lot less of them than the knights. If I can just figure out when they all gather in one place, it shouldn’t be difficult for me to wipe them out all at once.’\nOutwardly, it looked as though Lee Shin Woo was emitting a cool-headed vibe, but in actuality, Lee Shin Woo’s head was turning, busily studying the state of the soldiers deployed on the outskirts and the inner city. All while keeping a close eye on the movements of the magicians, especially on the level 6 Magician Leader.\n’If this guy can’t, then the lord must be the one who can communicate with the 12 generals. I’m sure of it.’\nIf he could just figure out which one for sure... then ’Operation: Bro, why are you there?’ could move on to the next stage. Lee Shin Woo’s goblin fire blazed; the plan was going really smoothly.",

    "content": "<Chapter 24. Operation - Bro, why are you there? - 2>\n\"There aren’t that many magicians over here.\"\n\"What...?\"\nIt’d been three days since he’d patrolled the inner city, and this was the result he’d come to after comparing information with Jin. Hearing that, Jin was momentarily dumbstruck, but soon retorted.\n\"You said those guys were the ones you needed to be most wary of. That it wouldn’t be so simple; that it wasn’t just knights patrolling around.\"\n\"That’s what I thought, but when I actually looked around, I found that it wasn’t all that. That’s what you found in your patrol too, right?\"\n\"That’s... That’s true.\"\nThere had been a time that Lee Shin Woo had assumed that all high leveled magicians would be on par with Kratia. However, that wasn’t the case. Kratia was the exception. Then again, she was a hero; she wouldn’t be a hero if she wasn’t the exception.\n’Moreover, it’s pretty obvious that their intellect went down considerably when they turned into the undead, though I’m not sure about their magic.’\nNormally, there weren’t that many undead that could even use magic. Even if they could, most of them could only focus on one or two spells. That’s because they wouldn’t be able to properly cast the spells without the calculations; the spells that they could cast were ones that they’d often used while they were still alive and were deeply instinctual.\nOf course, the higher leveled they were, the more they regained their abilities and intellect, so more higher leveled undead could use magic. However, the effectiveness of their magic was still a few levels down!\n\"Then what about that feminine looking undead? There’s a level 6 undead in the castle.\"\n\"Yeah. There is one magician in this city that I have to be wary of.\"\nThough there were few that were defending the inner city, the reason that the lord was so willing to send most of his knights to the outskirts was because he had someone he could count on in the inner city. It was none other than the level 6 Magician Leader!\nThe Magician Leader was dreary and feminine (the fact that he could ascertain what gender she was made it clear that she was a high rank undead), and like the lord, looked emaciated. At first glance, she looked slender, but she possessed impressive magic. It was at a level that didn’t trail behind Kratia’s, whose magic he’d checked before they parted ways.\n\"But that just means I have to be wary of her during battle. That’s all. I’m sure of it. Her communication abilities, surveillance abilities, and even her skill in basic magic searching is worse than mine. Even if she saw normal patterns that moved magic, or if I used magic to secretly provoke her, her response was always the same.\"\n\"If you provoke her, she might report it to the lord!\"\n\"Including all that, don’t we need to see how she responds to such a provocation?\"\n\"...\"\nThat meant that he was confident that his identity wouldn’t be exposed, regardless of how she responded to the provocation. Jin felt sick of hearing Lee Shin Woo’s confident attitude. The most surprising thing was that it wasn’t arrogance; that confidence always came from a thorough analysis.\n\"And as a result of my tests, she wasn’t able to sense my magic until very late, and was barely even able to sense it. Next, I released magic a few times into the air. Ultimately, it seemed as though she thought she was seeing things and returned to what she was doing.\"\n\"That trait of finally sensing magic but then not really doing anything about it really fits an undead...\"\n\"Right?\"\nIn other words, no matter how powerful they were, their brains were damaged, and thus, they were idiots. Her magic’s offensive capabilities were likely unquestionable, but this wasn’t the first time he’d fought against a powerful opponent; Lee Shin Woo was even confident enough that he could get close to and take care of her before she could even start casting her magic.\n\"The magicians aren’t really following the imperial command. The alarms in the city or the patrol routes aren’t covered by magic, and their only real purpose is to act as artillery troops...\"\n\"Then there’s nothing to be afraid of now. Let’s go to the secret facility.\"\n\"No, not yet. There’s just one more thing I have to do before we can move on.\"\nIt was to find their communication line with the 12 generals. If he just found it, and either destroyed or secured it, then he would have nothing to be afraid of. And now that he’d figured out that the magicians weren’t all that strong, the thing he had to look out for was...\n\"The lord.\"\n\"You’re just doing this for fun, aren’t you?\" Orıginal content can be found at NoveI~Fire.net\n\"I’m doing this so we can avoid danger and get a clean victory, you know? Ah, Jin. Starting now, figure out how to covertly get into the city without being seen.\"\n\"Can’t we just kill the lord and prevent them from contacting the 12 generals?\"\n\"Well, you’ll see.\"\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t blowing everything out of proportion just so that he could fulfill Guillotine Steelworker’s request.\nHe wanted to use this chance of infiltrating the city to figure out how the Empire operated... He also wanted take over the level 3 danger zone city as well. To do that, he couldn’t just kill the lord and run!\n’But if Jin knew about this, he wouldn’t really cooperate with me.’\nHe’d already experienced clearing several level 2 danger zone cities, but the level 3 danger zones and up were completely different. There were three level 6 elites in this city alone, and there also some normal level 6s on top of that... there were also hundreds of level 5s. If he added in the level 4 knights as well, they couldn’t take on those numbers.\nIt would be barely doable to fight straight-up if he had all of the Pauls and Golems with him. However, Lee Shin Woo couldn’t use up his valuable resources here.\n’Those guys... I should be able to use them.’\nHe left his lodgings and returned to doing his duty whilst his brain turned hectically. How could he destroy this city whilst completing his objective... He was gradually estimating how he would go about it.\n[Now... give your regular report...]\n’Huh...?’\nIt had only been a day since he’d marked the lord as his primary target, yet surprisingly, things were progressing much faster than he expected!\nWhile Lee Shin Woo was on his regular patrol and wasn’t even bothering to hide his presence, he began to see a peculiar magic reaction, though it seemed like the lord hadn’t expected him, a ’mere knight’ to see him.\n[Where, here... this way...]\nLee Shin Woo didn’t miss the lord’s flow of magic from beyond the bedroom door, and clearly remembered it. It seemed as though the lord wasn’t guarded in the least and was letting the world see his magic.\n’It’s not really that difficult.’\nTo be exact, it was about the same level as the Anti-Skull’s security. It was so easy to figure out that he actually felt uneasy; after the magic pattern was displayed, he heard a small sound coming from inside the room.\nAt the same time, he felt an odd magic reaction... it seems as though the lord had just taken out an item that he had been hiding.\n[Mm...]\nAt that moment, the mana pattern that the lord exhibited changed again. If the first was to unlock the security around the castle, then this one was to activate the magic tool that he’d taken out.\n’This isn’t very tough either.’\nIt wasn’t very difficult for someone who possessed general administrative rights. Of course, if the other heroes knew, including Kratia, they’d be pissed. Lee Shin Woo’s magical ability had developed significantly; to such an extent that they couldn’t even begin to imagine.\n[Greetings, Lightning General.]\nAfter Lee Shin Woo had completely memorized the magic pattern, he listened carefully to the suddenly speaking lord.\nUnfortunately, he couldn’t hear the other speaker, but he could at least tell that the one he was speaking to was one of the 12 generals, or more specifically, the Lightning General.\n[There are no abnormalities. Yes, of course.]\n[Our defense remains impenetrable. A golem, or even a single fly won’t be able to get through. But what kind of golem... No, it’s nothing.]\nIf Lee Shin Woo still had lips, he would be smiling bitterly right now. It was apparent that the lord’s back was bent and that he was kowtowing, even through the wall. Lee Shin Woo could also observe their one-sided relationship. That must prove just how high a General’s position was.\nBut then...\n[Unimportant changes...? But, mm...]\nBecause the lord kept repeating the Lightning General’s instructions, Lee Shin Woo was able to hear what the Lightning General was saying. As he thought, once an undead gets around the General level, they’re able to surpass the limited intellect of an ’undead’, which was slightly worrying to him...\n[There’s nothing like that. Yes, you can trust me to carry out your orders.]\nFortunately, because the lord was an idiot, the lord didn’t mention Lee Shin Woo at all! Of course, even if he did mention him, he was still acting as though he was an undead loyal to the Empire, so it wouldn’t be such a big deal. However, it was obviously much better to just pass over him than to draw attention to him.\n[Then in a month... Yes, of course. I’ll contact you if those golem bastards show up. His Imperial Majesty... it’s a relief that he’s still healthy!]\nThe lord was sycophantic to the very end of their conversation. Lee Shin Woo had acquired some information: he gave a regular report to the general once every month! Moreover, their conversation had ended without any mention of him, so as long as he stole the device that allowed the lord to communicate with the general, he would be able to clean everything up.\n’Hoo...’\nLee Shin Woo had a hunch that his plan could move on to the next stage. However, he didn’t act immediately.\n’I’m going to aim for a time when I can kill the lord without any suspicion. What’s most important is the aftermath... I have to focus on that first.’\nHe patrolled through the inner city, and it wasn’t only the lord or the magicians that he was keeping his eye on. Lee Shin Woo watched the undead who regularly visited the lord, as well as the lord himself, as he called them and gave them their orders... in other words, he watched how the undead within the city communicated with each other.\nThe knights who were finished patrolling would have to report to the lord, so the lord wasn’t left alone most of the time. There was a reason that this was a level 3 danger zone.\n’But still, it’s not like the lord’s protected 24/7.’\nHigh leveled undead accept their death and move on. They accept the fact that they have died, and build a new life and order for themselves. Obviously, these undead, who’ve accepted their deaths, are much scarier than those who roam around, rejecting that they’ve died.\nDespite that, there was still one habit that they couldn’t leave behind: sleep. Even though they know that they can’t sleep, they lay on their beds in order to retain their sanity. The higher ranked the undead, the more likely they were to do so.\n’And this lord is the same as well.’\nThat time was now! The lord, who had activated the lock again and hidden the crystal, slowly walked outside. Lee Shin Woo acted as though he met him by coincidence as he passed by the area, and calmly bowed his head.\n\"My lord.\"\n[Good work, Sir Seta.]\n\"This level of work is nothing if I can help uphold the imperial command.\"\n[Mm, very impressive. I’ll call you later separately and reward you.]\nHe responded, called over one of the knights nearby on standby, and went towards a different room. It was the room where the level 6 Magician Leader was staying in; it seemed as though these two were lovers before they died who always slept in the same place.\nThere was no way to tell if these two still were sexually active, but Lee Shin Woo prayed that they weren’t.\n’Nice. Then let’s see where they’re going.’\nLee Shin Woo saw the two join up and head to the bedroom, and naturally entered into the room the lord had once inhabited. He’d already perfectly memorized the patrol routes for the inner city, and knew that there wouldn’t be anyone guarding the lord’s room for 7 minutes.\n[Code 0819 Communication Line]\n[A high rank communication line that enables communication by using a special frequency.]\n\"Nice. Now I won’t encounter one of the 12 generals through this.\"\nHe unlocked the extremely simple lock and had extracted the communication line that had been hidden in the room. After Lee Shin Woo had placed it into his inventory, he comfortably escaped the room. And realizing that he had time to spare, grinned, and went towards the lord’s bedroom.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 24 part3",
    "content": "<Chapter 24. Operation - Bro, why are you there? - 3>\nWhile patrolling the inner city for the past few days, Lee Shin Woo had figured out exactly where all the knights and soldiers were stationed.\nFrom first glance, their defense looked impenetrable, with no avenue of getting through, yet the corridor leading to the lord’s bedroom chamber wasn’t watched. And above all, so long as one wasn’t discovered as soon as they entered the lord’s chamber, no one would even try to stop them from exiting through the corridor.\n[Thank you for all your hard work, Sir Seta.]\n\"You too. Is the lord asleep?\"\n[Yes, he is. With the Magician Leader. Ahem.]\nThe knight sheepishly slandered the lord. Lee Shin Woo imagined their skin and bones coming into contact with each other, entwined in lovemaking, and felt truly disgusted. But that just meant that this was his opportunity!\n\"If you’re aware of that, why are you standing here? We should just let them enjoy themselves and leave them be.\"\n[Actually, I’ve already sent the other soldiers away. I’ve already confirmed that it’s safe, so I was going to go...]\n\"Alright. I should go rest too.\"\nSince a level 6 magician was with the lord, more protection shouldn’t be necessary. As such, with just one sentence from Lee Shin Woo, the knight obeyed and left without any suspicion.\nHis plan probably wouldn’t progress as smoothly if the level 6 Knight Leader were here, but as soon as Lee Shin Woo had entered the inner city, the Knight Leader completely trusted in Lee Shin Woo and continued with upholding the imperial command. Everyone in the city trusted Lee Shin Woo!\n’Yeah, this moment is when it’s most exciting.’ Official source ıs novel•ﬁre.net\nWhen he was sure that the knight had left and there was no one left that could see him, Lee Shin Woo comfortably walked through the corridor. Soon, he gripped a Lightning Tooth in his hand.\n’At the very least, they fortified the room with magic in case of intruders.’\n’Even if it’s rotten, it’s still a Herring’, huh. The lord’s bedroom was complicatedly equipped with alarm and defense magic. But that was all. To Lee Shin Woo, who could ascertain the very base structure of magic, it was even more useless than a physical wall.\n\"Hut.\"\nLee Shin Woo swung his blade, emitting powerful lightning, while curving it intricately; the next moment, all the magic that had been set-up vanished.\nIf a smarter magician had set this up, then the moment that the magic was forcefully dispelled, there would be an additional measure, like a magical formula that trapped the invader. But unfortunately, the city’s Magician Leader wasn’t that talented.\n\"Hmph.\"\nBut regardless of how stupid the magician was, they should at least be able to quickly recognize when their magic was released. Therefore, Lee Shin Woo didn’t hesitate and walked through the room. To an onlooker, seeing the two bare undead would cause severe psychological damage; the man and woman looked shocked and locked eyes with him.\n[Huh!?]\n[You’re...]\nHe hadn’t acted very covertly, but he had been quick; the moment he entered the room and they discovered him... Lee Shin Woo’s Lightning Tooth shot out like lightning, and struck the Magician Leader’s neck, cutting her off from speaking.\nNo matter how much Lee Shin Woo’s stats had gone up, or how powerful Rule of Bone was, an elite level 6 undead wouldn’t go down from just a single strike. However, what he used wasn’t just a regular sword. It was artifact that contained the lightning element, an element that he’d unleashed to its full potential.\n[Ga...ah...]\n\"You probably can’t move. Yeah, it seems like you don’t have lightning resistance either. I would’ve preferred if you did, and could still move around...\"\nAmongst all of his other elements, lightning was by far his most powerful. The lightning element was inherently quick, and was ridiculously powerful as well. Aside from that, the lightning element possessed a special ability: the electric current would paralyze the recipient for a short time.\nEven if he wasn’t able to kill them, the fact that he was able to momentarily impair their movement meant that he had an advantage. Moreover, the electricity prevented one from speaking, so it was suited for covert operations.\n[What are you...]\nThe lord stood up and attempted to yell at Lee Shin Woo’s brutality, but from out of nowhere, a Lightning Tooth flew like lightning at the back of his nape, striking true. Of course, the lord was likewise silenced.\nIf the two hadn’t been bare naked, with no defensive equipment on, and hadn’t been engrossed in each other, things probably wouldn’t have progressed so easily.\n’As I thought, they can’t stop themselves from engaging in their habits... Because they weren’t able to completely give up their humanity, they die so emptily.’\nThe lord and the magician had stiffened in place, but Lee Shin Woo didn’t become careless, and struck them with another two flying Lightning Tooths. This was because their paralysis would soon wear off.\n[Guah...]\n\"...\"\nLee Shin Woo, who’d acquired so much time to finish the job, gripped the first Lightning Tooth that was still embedded in the magician’s neck, and discharged all the lightning, completely blowing her head up. A truly clean and explosive strike, befitting of the name Bursting Thunder!\nLee Shin Woo’s lightning had paralyzed her mana, so it was impossible for her to guard against it, even if she had attempted to use her magic to do so! Ultimately, the level 6 elite magician pitifully lost her life in an instant.\n[You have acquired 157,550 Perium.]\n[You have acquired the Lv6 Kadinan Magician Leader, Soulrit’s finger bone.]\nLee Shin Woo collected the loot with his free hand that wasn’t gripping a sword, and turned his head. The lord was bare naked like his lover, Soulrit, who had been the first to go, but when Lee Shin Woo looked over the lord’s unattractive body, and in particular, a specific part of his body, he became more and more pissed off.\n\"I’m a level 6 undead too, so why...!?\"\n[Gaahk...!]\nOf course, it was because they were bare naked that he was able to kill them so easily, but even so... why!? He couldn’t go any further, as saying anything more left a bitter taste in his mouth. Lee Shin Woo gripped the sword burrowed in the lord’s neck and forcefully twisted.\nA powerful electric current was quietly discharged, afflicting the lord’s body with a horrific pain, but... contrary to Lee Shin Woo’s desire to torment and curse at the lord for hours on end, the lord soon died.\n[You have acquired 210,780 Perium.]\n[You have acquired the Lv6 Undead Commander - Nellopa’s lower jawbone.]\n[You have acquired the Lv6 Undead Commander - Nellopa’s sphenoid bone.]\nIt had been a long time since one of Bone Reinforcement’s abilities, Lucky Finish had activated, but because of it, he’d acquired two level 6 elite bones. This should’ve been a happy occasion, but he didn’t feel all that happy about it right now.\nHe’d definitely killed the lord with his own two hands, yet it felt unbearable, as it felt like he’d been defeated by the lord! Lee Shin Woo had acted it up, but Lee Shin Woo similarly couldn’t completely give up on his humanity.\n\"Damn it... Huh?\"\nHowever, whilst muttering in frustration, Lee Shin Woo turned his attention elsewhere, looking at the table next to the bed where the lord and the magician had placed their clothes. Plan A was progressing well, so this was something he definitely needed!\n\"The equipment will probably transform. But the clothes that have no abilities should be fine...\"\nLee Shin Woo steeled himself and grabbed the pile of clothes, but he felt something else inside of it, something that wasn’t cloth. The moment Lee Shin Woo tilted his head, he saw an odd light. Fortunately, the clothes hadn’t changed, but an item that was hidden within them had changed!\n[You have acquired the Lv5 Heart Evolution Pendant. Through Bone Reinforcement, the item has transformed. You have acquired the Lv6 Bone Evolution Pendant.]\n\"Oh!?\"\nAs soon as the light subsided and a message appeared, Lee Shin Woo hastily grabbed onto the... level 6 pendant that had been inside the clothes.\nThe pendant shined a clear, dark grey and was composed of bone as expected. He didn’t know what it was originally made of, but he could strangely feel that it was extremely durable!\n\"I didn’t expect to get something like this... Moreover, it’s a level 6 artifact. As I thought, level 3 danger zones sure are different!\"\nLee Shin Woo was deeply touched and muttered. Moreover, this was the second level 6 accessory he’d gotten since the earring!\nIt’d evolved from level 5 to level 6, so he felt like he could tell what its special characteristics were; moreover, all he had to do was wear the pendant around his neck, so he could actually equip it, unlike the earring! He checked the item’s information in genuine happiness. Then...\n[Bone Evolution Pendant]\n[Lv6]\n[Durability: 570/570]\n[Options: Health +30, Magic +30]\n[Special Passive Skill: Bone Evolution - Through this skill’s effect, your bones gradually, and permanently become stronger. In effect, as your health increases, your body evolves.]\n\"What!?\"\nPutting aside that vague description of evolving his body, it would increase his health permanently, so he could understand why it was a level 6 artifact!\nBut if that’s the case, then did the earring that he’d picked up before have a similar permanent growth ability? Unfortunately, before he could check its info, it had transformed into bone, so he didn’t have a way of checking its previous ability.\n’Wait, no. There’s nothing to feel bad about. This pendant is a good enough find.’\nMoreover, this pendant’s growth ability was created due to its evolution from Bone Reinforcement. Just because it was a high level item didn’t mean that every high level item would have this kind of ability.\nNow then, there’s one thing left...\n\"Do I just equip this or absorb it?\"\nEven so, the skill was too special. He was worried that he may not gain the skill if he so recklessly absorbed it. But on the other hand, even if he didn’t absorb the skill, he would be able to call it from Bone Armory.\n\"...Yeah. Dad always used to tell me this. Things will work out.’\nIt didn’t take long for Lee Shin Woo to make his decision. Honestly, he didn’t have much time to even think things through right now, which helped him quickly make his decision. He immediately raised the pendant and activated Bone Reinforcement.\n[The Bone Reinforcement skill has become Lv8. The amount of information you can extract from each and every bone has increased.]\n[Absorbing the Bone Evolution Pendant. Health and Magic have increased by 30. The Bone Evolution skill is absorbed, divided between Rule of Bone and Bone Armory. Both skills’ abilities have increased.]\n[The Rule of Bone skill has become Lv8. Bones under the effect of Rule of Bone will gradually and permanently evolve. All stats have increased by 5.]\n[The Bone Armory skill has become Lv7. You can now summon six pieces of equipment at a time. All equipment information recorded in the Bone Armory are gradually and permanently upgraded. Health and Magic have increased by 20.]\n\"Oh, oooh...!\"\nRight after he checked his messages, Lee Shin Woo was sure that his gambit was a success.\nHe hadn’t acquired Bone Evolution as it was; he had fundamentally improved his two core skills: Bone Armory and Rule of Bone. He had attained a much better result than merely absorbing Bone Evolution.\nFrom the start, he’d always reinforced his bones through Rule of Bone. Absorbing the skill was the right choice, as Rule of Bone had attained the Bone Evolution skill.\n’But that’s not all. Bone Armory was affected as well.’\nIf he were honest, he was much happier about Bone Armory’s evolution than Rule of Bone’s. All his weapons’ information would be upgraded because of Bone Evolution!\nIt was extremely radical to say, but as time passed, he would be able to summon level 6, maybe even level 7 equipment!\n’I’d just infiltrated the level 3 danger zone to find out what was going on inside to complete the golem’s quest, yet I found an unimaginable treasure here.’\nWhen he thought about it, it was always like this. Obtaining his current karma, the Joker, as well as core abilities, Bone Armory and Rule of Bone, was all due to luck.\nOf course, he hadn’t obtained all of that just because he was lucky. He’d worked diligently in multiple areas so that he could collect different pieces of karma; the moment those pieces gathered into one, that karma had simply sublimated into something greater. The growth of Rule of Bone and Bone Armory was similar.\n\"...Nice. Then...\"\nHe felt like he could destroy the entire city all by himself, but Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t act purely out of self-confidence.\nLee Shin Woo sighed deeply, even though nothing came out, and examined the loot he’d acquired with a calm gaze. Whether Operation - Bro, why are you there? would proceed with Plan A or Plan B relied on this loot, the lord... Nellopa’s lower jawbone and sphenoid bone.",

    "content": "<Chapter 24. Operation - Bro, why are you there? - 4>\nMeanwhile, Jin was finding a route where he could travel unseen from the outskirts of the city.\nMost of the undead only saw him as a skeleton horse as he roamed around, so they weren’t overly concerned about him. Therefore, one could say that his task was an easy one.\n’Sure, it’s a lot easier than Shin Woo’s job of infiltrating the inner city teeming with undead, but... that idiot’s gathering information right in the middle of enemy territory, so...’\nDespite Lee Shin Woo explaining his actions most of the time to Jin, Jin still didn’t really understand what goes on in Lee Shin Woo’s head. It was like when his math teacher had explained mathematical formulas to him; no matter how patient and kind his teacher explained the subject to him, he wouldn’t understand it at all.\n’Damn... I feel like we’ve gotten closer, but it feels like we’re actually growing further apart... Even though I’m working hard not to fall behind, even if I can’t surpass him...’\nJin momentarily thought about Lee Shin Woo and naturally recollected the time he’d met God for the second time. He didn’t really know why, but he had asked God about Lee Shin Woo, not himself.\n[You may never speak to me again, yet that’s what you’re asking...? You’re an entertaining child as well. But sure. I’ll tell you. At least, all that I know.]\nAccording to God, heroes were individuals from different worlds that didn’t live their full lives; amongst those who died, those with incredible latent potential would be brought over to this world and turned into heroes. But even God herself didn’t clearly know which direction that potential would lead.\n[Especially that kid. The power I granted him wasn’t that strange. I thought he’d become a true hero once he used up all his revives, but he went completely astray.]\nJin recollected what God had told him about Lee Shin Woo and looked upset once more. He’d asked her about Lee Shin Woo so that he could learn more about him and understand him a bit more, yet even God didn’t really know what was up with him.\n[He hasn’t even shown his limits yet. You don’t need to try so hard to stand beside him.]\n[...Please send me back. I want to try out my new skill.]\nGod didn’t even know the limits to Lee Shin Woo’s potential. Jin wasn’t a little kid, so it wasn’t like he was jealous or anything, but whenever he felt the gap between their abilities grow farther and farther apart, he occasionally felt anxious.\n’I know that a person’s personality and potential differ based on the individual...’\nThere was nothing worse than having an inferiority complex towards one’s comrade. Of course, if he were comparing himself to a normal comrade, Jin wouldn’t sigh like this, but this was Lee Shin Woo he was talking about here. Rather, he should feel reassured by his teammate, but...\n[Lee Shin Woo - Jin, are you about ready?]\nBut in the midst of his restlessness, a private message from Lee Shin Woo appeared. Startled, Jin replied.\n\"I’m about done. I can fight at anytime.\"\n[Lee Shin Woo - We’re going with Plan A, like we’ve discussed. Apparently, almost all of our reinforcements have arrived, so get out without being seen and join up with the rest of them.]\n\"...So what’s Plan A anyway?\"\n[Lee Shin Woo - I already told you!]\nOf course, he did indeed listen to his explanation on Plan A. The next step of the plan was similar to what Lee Shin Woo had told him to do.\nFirst, he would join with their reinforcements and then enter into the city without being seen with the aforementioned route.\nFrom here, Jin’s role was incredibly important. With his incredible mobility, he would lead all of the monsters (the undead, level 4 Skeleton Knights and up) outside! In other words, he had to gather the mob!\n\"I know that far. But it’s hard enough to find them one on one. What do you plan to do by dragging them out all at once?\"\n[Lee Shin Woo - I already told you about that too. I’m going to Instigate the mobs and take them down.]\n\"Instigate...\"\nIt was indeed an impressive skill, but was it possible to control all of the undead within the city? Jin felt like Lee Shin Woo was being overconfident and felt uneasy, but he knew that Lee Shin Woo wasn’t the type to change his mind once it was made up.\n[Lee Shin Woo - See you later.]\n\"...Alright.\"\nJin finished the conversation by replying in an unsatisfied tone. As if waiting for that very moment, someone else messaged him, and that person was none other than...\n[Kratia Melloi - I’m here. Can we really get in undetected?]\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo had entered the city, he messaged his reinforcements, a.k.a. Kratia. Jin was aware that Lee Shin Woo and Kratia often talked with each other, but he hadn’t expected him to call her when he realized that he needed help.\n[Kratia Melloi - Are you listening?]\n\"...I’m listening. I’ll come out to meet you.\"\nIt wasn’t really a secret; Jin didn’t really like Kratia very much. She was talented enough to have a discussion with Lee Shin Woo as equals... since she was human, unlike him. And she was so eye-catchingly beautiful!\nWhenever he saw her, he felt like he was seething inside. Even though she didn’t really feel anything for Jin, he couldn’t speak to her kindly. Especially when he saw her talking to Lee Shin Woo!\n\"Why do you come running just cause Shin Woo asks?\"\n[Kratia Melloi - Because it’s a fair trade. I scratch your back, you scratch mine. Plus, we share any gathered knowledge. Mm. Excellent.]\n\"...I won’t take very long. Just wait.\"\nYeah, this really pissed him off. But because Jin would never in a million years tell anyone why it pissed him off, Jin just kept his mouth shut and ran along. And his form, which ran so quickly and covertly so that no one could witness it, was truly beautiful.\nIn just seconds, Jin was able to leave the city and arrive at their designated location. Kratia was already waiting there.\n\"Hey.\"\n\"...Yeah.\"\nHe’d heard about how she was doing from Lee Shin Woo, but it’d actually been a few months since they’d last met. Jin replied, equally as curt as Kratia, and observed her.\n’She’s way too pretty. You shouldn’t even be able to take care of it here, so how?’\nKratia looked even prettier than before. Her light purple hair, which extended every which way, was the same, but even that had become more distinctive, looking more charming than before. And her contrasting sky blue eyes looked straight at Jin.\n\"If you’ve become so much stronger, then Shin Woo must’ve gotten way stronger.\"\n\"Don’t talk to me like I’m the odd one out. He’ll beat you too.\"\n\"Hoo.\"\nJin said petulantly, yet Kratia just laughed relaxingly at his remark. Could it be...? Jin examined Kratia, but he couldn’t gauge her level at all.\n\"Then let’s go. We have to try our hardest not to fight anything and just drag them out, right?\"\n\"Yeah. ...Get on.\"\nHe really didn’t like someone else riding him, especially when it was Kratia, but... now wasn’t the time to be swayed by such trivial feelings. Kratia looked a bit apologetic and got onto his back.\n\"There are undead everywhere. They looked really organized.\"\n\"Are you doubting me? Just stay there and watch.\"\nJin replied coldly and soon began to run. Unlike Lee Shin Woo, Kratia wasn’t able to adapt to his speed and cried out, holding onto Jin as tight as she could whilst shivering. Jin felt just a bit better. He was well aware of how childish it was.\n\"We’ll be there soon.\"\n\"Keuk, guuuek.\"\nThere were definitely undead patrolling around in their immediate vicinity, but Jin had already completely figured out where they were, where they looked, and even their movements; he was in the same area, yet they didn’t notice him at all.\nIt was possible by combining Jin’s unimaginable reflexes and the route that Lee Shin Woo had mapped out.\n\"We have 11 seconds. We have to get in within that time.\"\n\"Gueeek... O-Ok...\"\nFrom the outside, it looked like a normal, empty space within a forest, but to Kratia, who’d been updated on the situation by Lee Shin Woo, soon realized what was being hidden over there. She barely managed to overcome her motion sickness somehow, and took out an item: the Limited Order Bone Core that Lee Shin Woo had remodeled.\n[Confirming general administrative authority. Opening facility.]\nAn enormous door suddenly appeared on the ground of the vacant lot, and screeched open such that one could barely make their way through the door. Kratia’s expression stiffened once she sensed the awful death energy from within.\n\"Do you think we’ll be able to get out safely...?\"\n\"I guarantee you that we’ll get out safely, so long as none of our opponents use magic.\"\nLikewise, Jin spoke stiffly.\n\"But the real problem’s what happens after we drag all these guys out.\"\n\"Ah, you’re right.\"\n\"Let’s go in before the undead catch on.\"\nThere are enemies everywhere, yet they were adding more enemies to their list. If the other heroes were to hear about this... No, there’s really no reason to compare themselves to other heroes for every single matter. The situation made Jin wonder whether Lee Shin Woo was really a hero or not! Updates are released by novel{f}ire.net\n\"It’s closed.\"\n\"Can you open it again?\"\n\"Yeah. That’s not a problem.\"\nAs soon as the two heroes entered the facility, the door closed automatically. Though they were thrown into the dark all of a sudden, Jin’s blazing blue goblin fire dimly lit up their surroundings.\n\"Do you see anything?\"\n\"...\"\nKratia was a typical magician. While Kratia’s other stats were fairly high, as she was at a high level, her magic stat was almost ten times that of her other stats. It was impossible for her to assess her surroundings with her agility.\n\"Keep your defensive magic up.\"\n\"Got it.\"\nBut Jin, who possessed a ridiculously high agility stat, immediately realized that this place was an abode of demons once he’d entered the facility. He’d heard an explanation from Guillotine Steelworker, but he hadn’t imagined that it would be such a mess.\n\"Huh? I can sense a golem’s magic... Weren’t they failed test subjects that were buried? Then why are there golems here?\"\n\"At the time, they might’ve just been failed test subjects, but...\"\nKratia asked whilst activating her defensive magic, and Jin replied stiffly. He had already been thinking about how he’d have to move so that he could protect himself from ’them’.\n[Mm, I sense someone.]\nThen, one of them noticed them trespassing. At that moment, the pitch-black facility lit up all at once, illuminating the entire area.\n[A human...]\n[It’s a human!]\n[An administrator?]\n[The Emperor?]\n\"...\"\nThe testing facility was definitely a lot bigger than they’d expected it to be, and it looked like it had been buried, as it overflowed with sand, as well as messily abandoned unknown cables, machines, golems’ bodies, and piles of metals. As well as...\n[Are the tests... over...?]\n\"These crazy...\"\nAll of them were fused together, as if their bodies were glued together, forming a singular monster. One was a human body inserted into the center of a torso, embedded with a core rather than a heart, and in another monster’s body, there was a human body bizarrely affixed to it.\n[Lv5 Golem Chimera] [1]\n[Lv5 Flesh Golem]\n[Lv6 Chimera Golem]\nOne thing they were sure about was that none of them looked like proper golems... no, none of them even looked like proper undead.\n[If not... then did we fail...?]\n[Failure...]\n[Are they... alive...?]\n[They’re alive...?]\nThese ’golems’ that they’d found oddly stumbled here and there whilst speaking hoarsely and gradually approaching. Kratia tightened her fists at the horrific sight, and Jin sighed deeply.\n\"Hold on tight!\"\n\"Gyaaaahk!\"\nAnd just like Lee Shin Woo had told them, he began running. In order to awaken this facility’s nightmare that lay dormant for dozens of years.\n[1] T/N: I’m not sure if this is intentional or not, but the author writes \"Golem Chimera\" and then inverts it with \"Chimera Golem\" below.",

    "content": "<Chapter 24. Operation - Bro, why are you there? - 5>\n[Mr. Lee Shin Woo has entered.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: It’s been a while. I’m glad you’re safe.]\n[Erian Ruparte: I’m glad you’re safe.]\n[Mentes Orun: Oh, you’ve come.]\nWhen he couldn’t move, the chatting channel was the best. He had to stay in position right now, so Lee Shin Woo entered the chatting channel, though it had been a long time since he’d last entered the channel. Like always, there were several of his seniors that happily greeted him upon entrance. Lee Shin Woo very naturally began to act and replied.\n[Lee Shin Woo: I’m glad you’re all safe as well, Seniors.]\n[Mentes Orun: What are you doing right now?]\n[Lee Shin Woo: I’m waiting for the right time.]\nThat’s right. The right time. Lee Shin Woo was waiting for the right time to attack. Life was all about timing, and it was even more important against the undead. And right now, Lee Shin Woo was beginning to realize how to adjust that timing.\n[Mentes Orun: The right time...?]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Is it an ambush? That must mean you’ve figured out where the undead troops are going.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: Something like that. I have to ambush the undead troops, as the size of their force is a bit too much for me.]\nTo be exact, it wasn’t a group of undead, but an entire city’s worth; it felt like he was attacking both the inner city and the outskirts simultaneously, not through physical means, but mental. They wouldn’t understand, even if he explained it to them, so he just concocted a story for them.\n[Silen Viesa: I’ve been hiding and picking off the undead one or two at a time, but you’re amazing, Senior!]\n[Mentes Orun: Those one or two undead are at the same level as you; plus, they’re elites. Man, it’s been tough holding out over here, but I feel a lot better with such talented juniors appearing.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Now that you mention talented juniors, I met that girl before. That newbie that entered the chatting channel briefly, but then left. Don’t be shocked, but she’s not weaker than me.]\n[Erian Ruparte: ...That strong girl, who happens to be unnecessarily beautiful as well. You’re talking about her, right?]\n[Mentes Orun: Eh, why are you getting upset again, young lady?]\nLee Shin Woo had already heard about it from Kratia. That she’d managed to come across other senior heroes. She thought that they might be trouble, but because Lee Shin Woo had given her information on them beforehand, it seemed like nothing bad happened.\n[Prince Altania: You don’t think she was level 7, do you?]\n[Lloyd H.K.: I’m not sure, but I’m sure that she’s either at my level or stronger. Ah, and she’s a magician too.]\n[Prince Altania: A magician... Hoo, then we’ll just have to see who’s better sometime! Show her who’s boss, am I right?]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Heroes shouldn’t fight amongst each other, you dumbass.]\nLloyd spoke, and it seemed like the conversation was briefly paused... but then, a calm voice continued, as if it were a commander deciding whether or not he should press the nuclear missile button.\n[Lloyd H.K.: Perhaps... we’ll be able to take on the 12 generals soon.]\n[Prince Altania: ...]\n[Lloyd H.K.: You (their seniors) told us before. There are level 7s amongst the 12 generals. If that’s the case, we should be able to take down one or two of them if we work together.]\n[Mentes Orun: Don’t be hasty, Lloyd.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: ...Senior.]\n[Mentes Orun: I’ve seen four level 7 heroes die all at once because they were just as hasty as you. ...So become stronger while it’s still safe. Don’t be too hasty, nor too lax... since we’re still going to die here.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: ...]\n[Prince Altania: ...]\nAh, the mood in the chatting channel suddenly turned for the worst! They had finally gotten over Shino Rendu’s death, but it seemed like they were still deeply affected by it.\nLee Shin Woo softly sighed. Who would think of them as heroes, acting like this!? But then, he received a message. Kratia had arrived.\n[Kratia Melloi: We’re in the middle of gathering them all and leaving... Shin Woo, save me.]\n\"Nice work. You gathered them a lot faster than I expected. Then I’ll get going now too.\"\n[Kratia Melloi: Wait, no. Help me first...!]\nKratia sounded like she was dying, but it probably wasn’t from a severe injury. It probably wasn’t easy for her to ride atop Jin when she had neither the Horseback Riding skill nor the Assimilation skill.\nHe pictured the small, almost doll-like and beautiful Kratia, dizzy and banging her head atop Jin’s back, and grinned. Then, he stood up, wore some clothes over his wrinkled and dirty flesh, and finally, looked over at the broken mirror.\n\"Nice. It’s perfect.\"\nThe mirror reflected the appearance of Kadinan’s lord, Count Nellopa.\n\"Ah, aah. Aaaaah.\"\nThe Disguise skill was also capable of changing one’s voice. Lee Shin Woo smiled after confirming that his voice had indeed changed to the lord’s dreary and dismal one. As if reflecting his mood, the reflected emaciated flesh twisted around.\n’How could I feel like I’m worse than this undead?’\nHe couldn’t hide his misery or his distress, but it didn’t matter; the lord was dead. He couldn’t ’stand’ again. In any way!\n\"Hoo... Nice, it’s a lot better than I thought it would be. It’s almost perfect.\"\nHe had somehow managed to raise his Disguise skill to level 4 in the past few months, and contrary to when the skill was level 1 and he had to be familiar with the target to barely imitate them, he could now imitate an undead with a similar form with just the information from one bone (this was also due to his Bone Reinforcement developing as well).\nHowever, he had been uneasy as he didn’t know how Disguise would work with the Undead Commander; after all, he was a completely different species... But he hadn’t expected him to drop two bones simultaneously! At that moment, Lee Shin Woo was sure of it. The fact that he’d be able to progress with Plan A.\nThat’s right. Lee Shin Woo’s Plan A of Operation - Bro, why are you there? is...\n\"As Kadinan’s lord, I command you. All forces, assemble! To battle!\"\n[M-My lord!?]\n[The lord came personally... what’s going on...!?]\nPlan A was unbelievable: kill the Undead Commander, act as him, and commandeer Kadinan’s forces!\n[The Lord has given the command. To battle!]\n[But, wait...]\n[Do you plan on defying the Lord’s command!?] Official source ıs NoveIꜰire.net\n[No, of course not!]\nThe knights were considerably flustered once they saw the lord yell out his command right after exiting his bedroom. Even so, they couldn’t defy the Lord’s command and immediately relayed his command to all of their forces. The once stagnant satellite city became excited in the blink of an eye.\n[What about the soldiers charged with a mission...?]\n[Recall them all! It’s the Lord’s command!]\n[Magicians! Equip your magical devices and get ready to depart immediately!]\n[But, the leader isn’t...]\n[Wait, now that I think about it, the leader isn’t here...?]\nOnly after creating a huge fuss did the undead realize that the Magician Leader was absent. Both the Magician Leader and the Knight Leader were missing, and the undead didn’t know what to do; they shifted responsibility, as if playing hot potato, but ultimately, one of the level 5 Elder Knights who had heard his command approached him.\n[My apologies, but wasn’t the Magician Leader with you, my lord?]\nThis was the question he had been waiting for. He couldn’t tell them himself, but he could wait for someone to ask! Lee Shin Woo took a deep breath without anyone knowing and simultaneously activated Acting and Instigate, and opened his mouth.\n\"The place we were protecting... There was an intruder at the ’Sanctuary’. The Magician Leader was the first to notice and attempted to defeat them, but was defeated instead.\"\n[As expected of the Magician Leader!]\nThe Sanctuary was slang for the area they protected under the imperial command. Of course, they were dumbasses that couldn’t tell that his lie about the Magician Leader was bullshit, but it seems like the words ’Magician Leader’ were quite effective on the undead, as they didn’t find his lie suspicious at all.\nBut because it was a lord’s castle filled with level 5 undead or higher, not everyone let it go and questioned him.\n[If that’s the case, then wouldn’t it be prudent to contact one of the 12 generals first, my lord...?]\n\"That was my first course of action; I contacted the general and reported what had happened. But even so, do we just stand still and do nothing? When we couldn’t prevent the intruders from entering the Sanctuary?\"\n[T-That’s not my intent...]\n\"I cannot wait until the Lightning General arrives. It’s not only to prove my loyalty to the Emperor. I must punish these intruders myself. This is... this is...\"\nLee Shin Woo replied. He briefly evened out his breathing and looked as though he were pushing down his anger. The Elder Knight saw this intense anger and gulped, even though he didn’t have any saliva to swallow down, and stepped back. Lee Shin Woo was satisfied with that.\n’Good. It seems like faking my facial expressions is perfect as well.’\nHe’d never been in a relationship before, so he obviously didn’t know what it felt like to lose a lover. However, he remembered how sad he was when his scary friend in elementary school stole one of his grilled beef patties from his precious lunchbox that his mother had bought for him, so when he recollected those feelings, they completely bought his lie.\n\"We will uphold both the imperial command and at the same time, beef patties... I mean, it is also vengeance for the Magician Leader, Soulrit. ...Understood?\"\n[Kuheuk...]\n[The lord...]\nLee Shin Woo’s simmering anger and regret lead to one thing: vengeance! His feelings were clearly conveyed to the rest of the undead, causing them to feel both grief and pity! And sure enough, at that very moment, his skill leveled up.\n[The Instigate skill has become Lv4. You amplify the emotions of your listeners and can cover for any contradictions or scanty evidence.]\nWhenever his skill leveled up, the skill explanation would always be nothing more than ’is this really ok like this?’, but Lee Shin Woo kept a positive mindset, thinking that it’s a great skill and decided to completely ignore the message.\nHe needed to concentrate on all the undead focusing entirely on him right now. Ah, and he needed to focus on his partner, as well as his temporary partner, who were being chased from afar!\n[Everyone, line up! We go to uphold the imperial command! Remember that, and focus!]\n[As you command, my lord!]\nLee Shin Woo saw more than 10,000 troops lining up outside of the outer walls, and yelled without even twitching an eyebrow. The knights, charged with missions and that were in other areas, led soldiers and assembled as well; their numbers began to swell once more.\n[I trust that you know what the situation is!]\nLee Shin Woo used Instigate with each and every one of his words, his voice resonating and relaying his orders to the troops. This was to ensure that none of them became suspicious of him while simultaneously being a show of strength that would inspire them.\n[The ones who dared to invade the Sanctuary are there. Our mission is extremely simple. Executing all those who oppose his majesty! Do you understand!?]\n[I understand!]\n[As you command, my lord!]\nThousands of undead shouted all together, responding to his call. Hearing that, he calmly nodded his head, and if anyone were to see this, they would see him as an unimaginable big shot.\n\"Jin, when the two groups start fighting, take Kratia and run. I may be controlling them with my skill, but I don’t know how they’ll react to seeing someone alive.\"\n[Jin Taylor: I got it. I got it, but... how exactly are you going to do that?]\nLee Shin Woo didn’t reply. Instead, he ordered his entire troops to advance.\n[To battle!]\n[Don’t die in vain! You may not die until you uphold the imperial command!]\n[Uooooooooooooh!]\nAround that time, most of the knights and soldiers that had been guarding the Sanctuary (there were several undead that had already been killed from Jin and company) had come under his leadership, so he had around 20,000 soldiers under his command. It was truly a reassuring sight.\n\"All forces, halt! I see our enemy!\"\n[Our enemy!? But... our enemies are coming!]\nThat moment came faster than Lee Shin Woo had expected. After leading his troops and advancing for only a few hours, he saw a horse kicking up a dust cloud on one side... as well as formidable monsters that were chasing after him fiercely.\n\"Wow, that’s crazy. What the hell are Golem Chimeras...?\"\nHe didn’t know if the group that chased after Jin and Kratia would be at least level 5 or not, but when he checked the levels of the thousands of monsters, he smirked. But once his subordinates, the other undead, saw a mob of powerful enemies appear, they felt uneasy and took up their battle positions.\n[Jin Taylor: Hey, I can see the undead troops! But where are you!?]\nHe’d gathered mobs and even ran whilst allowing Kratia to ride on his back. Ultimately, Jin saw the undead force and was shocked at the force that numbered in the tens of thousands; he opened a private chat and messaged Lee Shin Woo. Lee Shin Woo calmly replied in the private chat.\n\"I’m right over here.\"\nHe said and calmly waved his hand. At first, Jin couldn’t see where Lee Shin Woo was, as he was protected by the level 6 Knight Leader, as well as a number of high leveled undead. However, he soon realized what Lee Shin Woo was doing and gaped.\n[Jin Taylor: You’re...]\nHe was at the center of the undead force; he was protected by them, instead of being the recipient of their attacks. No, from first glance, it just looked like Lee Shin Woo had just become the Undead Commander.\n[Jin Taylor: Why are you there!?]\nOnce he heard that, Lee Shin Woo was sure that Operation - Bro, why are you there? had succeeded perfectly.",

    "content": "<Chapter 24. Operation - Bro, why are you there? - 6>\n\"It’s them!\"\nLee Shin Woo yelled, as if he’d found the bully who had taken his short rib patties.\n\"Those wicked beasts are our enemies!\"\n[The lord has given the order: annihilate them!]\n[Follow the lord’s command!]\nOnce the Knight Leader repeated Lee Shin Woo’s command, the surrounding undead responded by raising their weapons and advancing. It was as if their spirits could even topple a mountain! However, a few of them hadn’t been caught up in the mood, and timidly asked.\n[I feel a living being’s energy in front of them...]\n\"Is that really important right now!?\"\n[Kuheok!]\nLee Shin Woo yelled. To an undead, being hostile to the living was paramount over all else; no, he supposed that their deeply ingrained instincts were just as important, so they wouldn’t just meekly nod their heads and obey his order when a living being is present!\nTherefore, he needed to request that they overcome their base instincts.\n\"We’re upholding the imperial command! We can take care of them later!\"\n[I-I understand!]\nBecause of how intimidating Lee Shin Woo was, the thunderstruck undead halted any hostilities towards Kratia and Jin, and focused their attention onto the Golem Chimeras.\nLee Shin Woo sent a message, telling them to take this opportunity and get out, and Jin, though dumbfounded, instinctively moved his body out of range of the undead. Though they were well within the range of the undead magicians, the undead magicians were now focused entirely on the Golem Chimeras and thus, let Jin and Kratia go unscathed.\n[Un...dead...?]\n[We... will... enemy...]\n[Kuhik... Kill them, kill them!]\n[You’re... trying to kill us again...!?]\n[I’m sick of... the Empire... and the Emperor...!]\n[Kill them! Kill them all!]\nAround that time, the Chimera troops, which had been chasing after Jin and Kratia like madmen, turned their attention towards the undead troops led by Lee Shin Woo.\nThough the Golem Chimeras, who had been asleep within the facility and recently awakened by magic stimuli, deeply resented Kratia, who possessed a healthy, living, and intact body while they themselves did not, their resentment towards the knights and soldiers that charged in the name of the Empire was considerable as well.\n’Jin and Kratia sure did well gathering those guys.’\nWhether it was a chimera with a normal golem’s body, but with human limbs attached, or one with two cores inserted into a human body’s twisted flesh, all the chimeras had a similarly bizarre fighting spirit, which was truly an astonishing sight. However, the undead troop’s morale was no joke either.\n[How dare you murder the Magician Leader! Kill them with extreme prejudice!]\n[As you command, my lord!]\n[Stop these awful beasts from reaching the rest of the Empire! We have to take care of them ourselves until one of the 12 generals comes!]\n[Kill themmmmmmmmmm!]\nThus, thousands of level 5 Flesh Golems, and the undead force, six times the size of the Chimeras and averaging at level 4, crashed into each other!\n\"Hoo... Nice. Shall I try acting like the Undead Commander?\"\nIn this world, numbers alone cannot overcome a qualitative difference in strength; thus, it was quite obvious that Kadinan’s forces should lose. However, Lee Shin Woo’s level 7 intermediate Command, as well as his Instigate skill could make up the difference! Now was the time for him to test just how much better his Command skill had gotten after absorbing the Undead Commander’s bone and leveling up!\n[They’re just worms rebelling against the Empire! Are you going to lose without even fighting back!?]\n[Kuheuk...Kuaaaaaaaaahk!]\n[We are... knights of the Empire! The swords of the Empire!]\n[The swords of the Empire! We are the swords that cleave evil! [1]]\nThe synergistic effect between Instigate, which steered people’s emotions a certain way and amplified them, and Command, which boosted the morale and combat abilities of his troops, was ridiculously high.\nBut the effects were so pronounced that even Lee Shin Woo himself was thunderstruck; almost as if on cue, organized messages courteously appeared before him.\n[Instigate amplifies the effect of the Command skill. All friendly forces’ morale has almost been raised to its limit. All offensive and defensive capabilities of your forces increase by 20%! A part of your subordinates can now use Bone to Bone; staking their lives to inflict a critical injury upon their enemies no matter what.]\nHis voice reached all of his troops due to his Instigate skill, and a faint red energy covered their bodies. Moreover, a portion of his troops, picked at random, would gain a skill that would even enable level 4 Skeleton Knights to inflict a critical injury onto level 5 enemies!\n’A skill? Does this effect manifest when my Command skill levels up even more? If not, then is it because of the Instigate skill? ... And more importantly, Bone for Boneis kind of...’\nIt wasn’t flesh for bone, but bone for bone [2]. Lee Shin Woo didn’t really feel like that change was necessary, but he soon realized that it would be incredibly disrespectful to the skill if he kept thinking like that.\nHe heard the sound of bones cracking across the battlefield, as well as powerful strikes that caused the Chimeras to clearly falter and retreat.\n[Proud knights of Kadinan! Give up your lives for the lord!]\n[If I can help the lord, even with this rotten body, then I will do so for so long as he asks it of me!]\n[Should this body die again and again a hundred times over...! [3]]\nLee Shin Woo was deeply moved as he saw the weak knights resolve themselves and sacrifice themselves to inflict damage upon the Chimeras. What a profit!\n[Knights of Kadinan, show them your loyalty towards the Empire! Magicians of Kadinan!]\n[Uoooooooh!]\n[We’ll burn all those wretched worms and show our loyalty to the lord!]\n[We (Kadinan) are one!]\nLee Shin Woo enthusiastically raised his voice, inciting the troops further, and the undead responded in kind; they raised their swords and wands, and shouted along with him. An outside observer might think that Lee Shin Woo had been their lord for 30 years!\n\"Is that really Shin Woo?\"\n\"Yep.\"\n\"Why is Shin Woo there?\"\n\"I don’t know. But I’m kind of curious as to who the ’Bro’ would be in Plan B...\"\n\"Huh!?\"\nMeanwhile, Jin and Kratia had successfully completed their mission and had escaped from the battlefield. They watched as the undead troops led by Lee Shin Woo, and the Chimeras that they’d gathered from the facility fiercely fought against the other, and cordially voiced their opinions vacantly.\nUpon reuniting, they both instinctively watched the other (obviously, there was no ill will there) and even argued with each other, but upon watching the spectacle laid out for them by Lee Shin Woo, they had no other choice but to put aside their differences.\n\"You might be right. I can’t keep up with that. The genre’s completely different.\"\n\"What did I tell you?\"\nThey watched the battle between the two forces whilst resting and relaxing the overwhelming tension from gathering the mob from the past few hours.\nThe difference in strength due to the level disparity was clear, but Lee Shin Woo’s Command and Instigate skills were still being used. Actually, Lee Shin Woo’s troops were starting to win, bit by bit! Perhaps his skill in commanding was even better than the Undead Commander, Count Nellopa, who possessed the Commander karma.\n\"What exactly have you guys been doing...?\"\n\"You saw a bit of it before when you were with us, didn’t you?\"\nThen again, this was Lee Shin Woo, who had split apart an army and caused them to self-destruct. If she thought back to that, it wasn’t really that surprising that Lee Shin Woo had commandeered an entire army to fight against another army.\n\"It seems like he’s gotten a lot stronger too.\"\n\"Actually, his increase in strength is a lot more pronounced than these other abilities. He’s been fusing skills...\"\n\"Fusing skills... It must be tough travelling alongside a monster like that...\"\n\"Don’t call my partner a monster.\"\n\"Oh...?\"\nShe’d thought that they’d completely reconciled by now, but it seemed like they were still at odds. Kratia pondered whether or not she should say anything at this point and her lips parted, but she ultimately decided to change topics. Not to mention that there was something that was bothering her.\n\"Are you sure you’ve stopped one of the 12 generals from coming?\"\n\"Seems that way.\"\n\"The seniors I met before told me go unnoticed in the level 3 danger zones. That I shouldn’t make a fuss, and if I did, a big shot would show up.\"\n\"I feel like it’s been several hours since Shin Woo started making a fuss.\"\n\"I see...\"\nFrom the very beginning, the reason Lee Shin Woo infiltrated the city and acted was to avoid an encounter with one of the 12 generals. He had used all the means available to him to tie up all the loose ends and move as quickly as possible; so long as the general didn’t have rockets on his feet, he wouldn’t be able to catch Lee Shin Woo.\nLee Shin Woo was daring, but he wasn’t an idiot. He’d made this plan after carefully assessing his own abilities.\n\"That’s what’s scariest: it wasn’t made out of pride.\"\n\"I’m a bit scared too.\"\nFortunately, things got a little better between Jin and Kratia again. They watched the undead free-for-all, as if they were enjoying some sort of war movie. Eventually, Kratia finished recovering her magic and stepped forward, as if she intended on helping.\n\"It seems like they’re evenly-matched, so it should be fine if I were to cut down both sides, right?\"\n\"But you can’t let them aggro onto you.\"\n\"I know at least that much.\"\nKratia replied leisurely, and covertly raised her magic. Jin’s goblin fire blazed immensely as he observed her.\nJin hadn’t noticed before, as they had only intended on provoking the Chimeras in the testing facility, but now that he had a chance to watch her draw upon all of her magic, he realized that the quantity was absurd.\n\"You...\"\n\"Huheut.\"\nKratia simply offered a subdued smile to the shocked Jin and displayed her magic. First, she would look for a wide area, and once cast, the large-scale debuff would freeze the mana of all those within that area, as well as disrupt their teamwork.\nBefore she could cast the spell, she had to completely understand all of the magic in the area, so it was an incredibly difficult task. While it was difficult to use, its effects were covert and immediate, so there was no better spell to use... in this situation...\n\"H-Huh...?\"\nHowever, she couldn’t continue with the spell. Kratia’s face momentarily paled. Though her face was normally quite pale, her complexion was pale enough to now resemble an ice statue.\n\"Did you fail?\"\n\"No, that’s not it.\"\nKratia firmly denied, and demanded a clear answer from Jin.\n\"You said one of the 12 generals wasn’t coming!\"\n\"They’re not. Shin Woo guaranteed that they weren’t.\" Follow current novᴇls on novel✦fire.net\n\"Then what the hell is that!?\"\n\"I have no idea what you’re talking... about... huh...?\"\nJin replied in frustration, but finally saw what she was talking about with his high agility. The moment he saw it, he looked into its identity and was dumbstruck; then, he messaged Lee Shin Woo.\n[Jin Taylor: Shin Woo, is that part of your plan!?]\n\"Advance more aggressively... Huh? What do you mean if it’s part of my plan? It’s perfect.\"\n[Jin Taylor: No, it’s become imperfect just now!]\n\"Huh...?\"\nLee Shin Woo had noticed its approach later than Kratia or Jin, not because his abilities were worse than theirs, but because his command over the undead was just that important. In any case, it was fortunate that he was able to figure out what they was talking about after listening to Jin’s warning.\n\"T-The hell...\"\nThere was something pushing through the dense, rotten trees beyond the mountain range at an incredible speed.\nIt was violently emitting a ridiculous amount of mana, and his eardrums, which he didn’t even have, threatened to burst from its scream; the familiar face that was violently running towards them was...\n\"Bro...\"\nLee Shin Woo couldn’t help but acknowledge that his plan, Operation - Bro, why are you there? had been completely derailed.\n[Lv7 Treasure Eater]\n\"Steve, why are you there!?\"\n[1] T/N: Could be a reference to Sanger Zonvolt from Super Robot Wars.\n[2] T/N: A Chinese saying adapted to Korean.

    "content": "<Chapter 24. Operation - Bro, why are you there? - 7>\n[You have encountered a higher leveled foe. The Rebellion skill increases all skills by 14%! Half of the effects are shared with your subordinates!]\nLee Shin Woo hadn’t really thought about it very much, but Bone Armory pretty much stored all of his equipment in his body. All the recorded equipment didn’t disappear, but instead became one with Lee Shin Woo; the equipment was also maintained by his body, and what’s worse, developed in his body.\nHe’d absorbed countless pieces of equipment and stored them in his body, and fused different attributes together in order to create even greater equipment. Thus, Lee Shin Woo’s body was like a treasure house. The moment any Treasure Hunter sensed his presence, it was obvious that they’d turn their attention to him!\nPlus, Kratia’s rare, growing artifact was enough to draw the Treasure Eater’s attention as well. It made sense that a Treasure Eater would appear when both of these ’treasures’ were in the same place.\n\"But why did he have to come now?\"\nLee Shin Woo was sure this issue came about due to his terrible operation name, and grit his teeth. But while he stared vacantly at the Treasure Eater, the Treasure Eater continue to advance, sending parts of the undead force flying; thus, he didn’t have any more time to spare.\n[What is that?]\n[The lord... Protect the lord!]\n[Kuahk, these monsters won’t let us go!]\nThe undead realized that Lee Shin Woo was the Treasure Eater’s target and even in their confusion, attempted to stop it from getting to him. But because they were definitely categorized as ’enemies’ by the Chimeras, they continued to tactlessly attack the undead troops, ultimately resulting in further undead casualties.\n[Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\nTo make matters worse, Steve used the Treasure Eaters’ patented technique, the Shriek of the Dead. Should he say ’as expected of a level 7’? Its shriek instantaneously affected the entire area.\n[The enemy has used Shriek of the Dead! However, Invisible Heart has completely protected you against mental status ailments.]\nLee Shin Woo momentarily did a double take and turned around. He was worried that Jin wouldn’t be able to endure it, especially because he wasn’t currently linked with him. Fortunately, Kratia had used her magic to protect both her and Jin from the shriek. As expected of a high level magician.\n[That monster’s using black magic!]\n[Don’t be afraid! The lord’s watching over us!]\n[Let’s stab its limbs with our spears!]\n’The undead are also... Good, they’re fine as well.’\nHe had roughly expected this outcome. Firstly, his troops were under the effects of his Command skill, which protected them from status ailments, and secondly, his Instigate skill had already taken affect; both the Shriek of the Dead and Instigate were the same type of skill, but Shriek of the Dead was definitely a lower ranked skill than Instigate. Therefore, Shriek of the Dead wasn’t very effective.\n[Ku-Kuhahk... Y-You bastards...!]\n[The Emperor? The Emperor is... No, I won’t participate in it!]\n[Don’t take me there. Not me...!]\nHowever, the Chimeras, who weren’t protected by either Kratia or Lee Shin Woo, were affected by the Shriek of the Dead. While the Chimeras were physically enhanced to the very limit, they were susceptible to mental ailments and were all affected by the Treasure Eater’s Shriek of the Dead.\nThe deeper one’s regret and resentment, the more effective Shriek of the Dead was. It was as though the Golem Chimeras were born to be affected by the Shriek of the Dead.\n[No, no. Don’t nod your head! Don’t!]\n[You can’t. The Emperor lied to us!]\n[Please don’t!]\nWere they remembering the time when they became sacrificial lambs for the experiments? The Chimeras cried tears of blood as they screamed and rolled onto the floor. Thousands of level 5 monsters had become unable to fight from just one skill!\nLee Shin Woo felt a bit sad when he saw them, but because of the Treasure Eater, the undead army could now breathe easy.\n[It’s time!]\n[Gouge its bones! Charge!]\n[Guoooooooooooh!]\nThe undead troops suddenly pushed past the Chimeras and charged at the Treasure Eater! Lee Shin Woo shouted quickly in an attempt to stop their indiscriminate attack, but because of the sudden turn of the events, the undead weren’t capable of properly accessing the situation.\nUltimately, he couldn’t stop half of them, and hundreds of undead rushed towards the Treasure Eater. Lee Shin Woo clicked his tongue and had no other choice but to watch the ensuing battle.\n’Now that it’s come to this, I suppose I have to sacrifice them to find out my opponent’s abilities...’\nHe clearly remembered when he’d first fought against the Treasure Eater, his desperate battle against the level 3 Treasure Eater, and even when he’d fought against the level 5 Treasure Eater.\nLee Shin Woo would get screwed whenever he encountered a Treasure Eater as it would always possess a unique ability. Plus, this Treasure Eater was level 7, so he wouldn’t be surprised if it could teleport and take a bite out of his ’heart’.\n[Guoooouuuuh!]\nAnd just as Lee Shin Woo expected, the Treasure Eater had a special ability. Fortunately, it wasn’t teleportation, but when it screamed, hair fell off of its body; then, blue light seemed to spew from its body, which ended up being lightning!\n[Kuaaaaaaahk!]\n[M-My lord!]\nThe Treasure Eater twisted its body, discharging lightning everywhere. The undead that came into direct contact with the lightning screamed, but they were better off than the rest. The weaker level 4 and level 5 undead couldn’t even scream before they vanished.\nLee Shin Woo gritted his teeth at the power that the level 7 elite displayed. He was frustrated at how it seemed no weaker despite using such an attack.\n’I barely got control over this army, yet they become a barbecued bone platter in the blink of an eye...!’\nIt didn’t matter whether it was against a level 1 skeleton or a level 5 skeleton; there wasn’t much difference between how long it would take for it to grill them anyway. Therefore, it would be stupid to just stand still and do nothing. Lee Shin Woo, who’d inwardly made his decision, used his Instigate skill to its very limit and yelled.\n[All troops, retreat! We’ll fight him in the city!]\n[B-But my lord...!]\n[All forces! Protect Kadinan!]\n[I... I understand!]\nNone could refute Lee Shin Woo’s stern command, and all of the undead there turned around. Their movements were so organized and systematic that... Lee Shin Woo’s movement, or lack thereof was quite noticeable.\n[M-My lord!?]\n\"His target’s me.\"\nLee Shin Woo said bravely.\n\"I’ll keep him busy, so you return to the city and evacuate all of the civilians from the city. Once I’m sure that everyone has been evacuated, I’ll bring him over.\"\n[It’s too dangerous, my lord!]\n[I cannot allow it!]\n\"You dare doubt me!?\"\nLee Shin Woo’s booming voice even startled the most powerful undead in Kadinan, the Knight Leader, Selloin.\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo was the lord he served and was a level 6 Undead Commander, but the Knight Leader had thought that his abilities surpassed the lord’s. However, once the Knight Leader heard the strength in Lee Shin Woo’s voice, he realized that that might not necessarily be the case.\n\"Go now. Even now, our precious soldiers are being sacrificed! You fool, I don’t plan on dying in vain. Kadinan and I are one. I will not fall, so long as Kadinan stays standing!\"\n[M-My lord..!]\n[Kuheuk, as expected of the lord we serve...!]\nThe Knight Leader, as well as the surrounding knights, were touched by Lee Shin Woo’s brave declaration and were on the verge of tears. He’d managed to fool them completely. Though Lee Shin Woo was planning on destroying Kadinan in its entirety so that he could safely annihilate the Treasure Eater!\n\"Go. Go tell them. Arm yourselves and be ready to die for Kadinan!\"\n[All the citizens will follow your command!]\n[My lord. At least let me stay by your side...]\n\"You fool. Only you can command in my absence! Don’t say anything so foolish and go!\"\n[Keuk... I understand! I will carry out your command perfectly, I swear it!]\nEven as he cursed at him, Lee Shin Woo reminded the Knight Leader that he was the next in command and that he had to be responsible for the troops in the lord’s absence; his words spurred him to act, causing the Knight Leader’s eyes to blaze with a bit of goblin fire and turn around.\nEven the undead that had been indiscriminately attacking the Treasure Eater began to assemble to the best of their ability. At least 20% of the troops had been burnt to crisp already, but it was comforting that most of their casualties were level 4s.\n[Guaaaaaaaaaah!]\nOf course, from the very beginning, the Treasure Eater’s target had been Lee Shin Woo and Lee Shin Woo alone. Therefore, when the obstructing skeletons got out of its way on their own accord, it seemed thankful and beelined towards Lee Shin Woo. Some of the knights couldn’t help themselves and turned around, drawing their swords, but Lee Shin Woo restrained them once more.\n\"I won’t say it again! Go!\"\nLee Shin Woo said, and once he raised his sword in one hand, they resigned themselves and turned around. It seemed like it hadn’t occurred to them that they had never seen that sword before.\n\"Now let’s see how good a lightning element monster is...!\"\nOnce he confirmed that the undead troops had fully retreated, Lee Shin Woo moved his body quickly and infused mana into the Lightning Tooth, as if to lure in the Treasure Eater.\nLee Shin Woo transformed all of his mana, which was at a frightening level, into pure lightning and infused it into the Lightning Tooth. The blade was covered in flickering blue sparks, and looked as though God had sent this lightning herself. Seeing that, the Treasure Eater snorted and opened its mouth.\n[Guuuuuuoooooooooh!]\n\"Heup!\"\nA lightning sphere popped out of its mouth! But because Lee Shin Woo had already figured out that its mana was mainly concentrated in its throat, he had already expected what kind of attack was coming beforehand. Lee Shin Woo threw his body out of the way, dodging the sphere, and forcefully shot out with the Lightning Tooth in turn.\n[Kihahk!]\nWith Rule of Bone, it seemed like the Lightning Tooth actually shot out at the speed of lightning, and burrowed into the Treasure Eater’s throat before it could close its mouth.\nOnce it became level 7, it became like some sort of dragon, as it had attained thick and durable scales. Even so, its inner organs had to be much less durable than its scales! Lee Shin Woo immediately exploded the Lightning Tooth, and funnily enough, despite it being level 7, it writhed in pain and made one full rotation on the floor.\n[Kihaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\n\"Keuk!?\"\nBut that was all. Though it should be in a considerable amount of pain, as well as sustaining severe injuries from the lightning covered blade and the resulting explosion, the momentarily moaning Treasure Eater immediately regained its posture and charged straight at Lee Shin Woo!\n\"Come out, fortress!\"\nLee Shin Woo, startled by the Treasure Eater’s unexpected speed, summoned a giant shield from Bone Armory (the reason he’d shouted so loudly was because he wanted to), placed it in front of him, and retreated.\nThe giant shield, which was embedded into the ground and created by weaving giant bones together in strands, truly looked like a fortress.\n[Bone Fortress]\n[Lv5]\n[Durability - 2,250/2,250]\n[Defense - 1,200 - 1,400]\n[Options - Effectiveness of defense +50%]\nWhether one looked at the level, the ridiculous amount of defense, or its even more ridiculous option, there was no way this couldn’t be considered a treasure! He’d gotten this shield from killing one of his undead seniors, but once it had been absorbed into his Bone Armory, it had been remodeled. Of course, it was an item that was bestowed upon a hero by God, but...\n[Kuaaaaaaaaah!] ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ n͟o͟v͟e͟l͟f͟i͟r͟e͟.net\n\"Uuuuuuhk!\"\nThe shield couldn’t even withstand the Treasure Eater’s charge for 1 second and broke apart! It had become weaker after smashing through the Bone Fortress, but its charge still retained an absurd amount of power; it got close and almost hit Lee Shin Woo. The resulting force flung him several meters, and left him with no other option but to endure the pain.\nIn pain, Lee Shin Woo diligently restored his body and thought.\n’Damn, this is... 100%.’\nHe hadn’t expected it to recover from the shock and charge so quickly. Now he was sure. The Treasure Eater possessed Lightning Resistance. It had the full package! He had a hunch when it had unleashed its lightning, but now that it’d come to this, he could say that he was sure now.\n’It can’t be helped. I have to take it down.’\nHe was thinking about how he could somehow lead it somewhere else whilst finishing up all his business here, but upon realizing that it had something he wanted, he knew he had to take it down.\n\"This probably won’t be enough...\"\nNothing good would come of him leading it to the city. Even if he did, the undead would just be sacrificed to reduce its mana. That’s all.\nBut even taking that into consideration, it wasn’t enough to take down a level 7 elite. Even if he added in the Chimeras, which were rolling around, as well as Kratia and Jin, who were behind him on standby, it wouldn’t work.\n\"Then.\"\nLee Shin Woo evaded its next attack and hectically moved his body around; he steeled himself and took out a small marble-like object. This was the obvious course of action. Since there was an opponent he couldn’t beat with his plan...\n\"The Lightning General, the great sword of the Empire. I, Nellopa, the Empire’s loyal servant, have an urgent report for you.\"\nThen he just needed to make a new plan!",

    "content": "<Chapter 25. Hansen Von Dorthe - 1>\nOnce Lee Shin Woo had seen Nellopa’s movements, he was able to understand the magic pattern immediately. He formed the connection extremely quickly and naturally. The communication line didn’t show faces and only transmitted one’s voice, so it was quite simple.\n[Mm... Is that you, Nellopa?]\n\"Yes, General.\"\nHe was communicating with one of the 12 generals, the Lightning General. He realized that the communication line would enable him to communicate with only the Lightning General after going through Count Nellopa’s memories.\nBut that was actually quite fortunate. Count Nellopa knew quite a bit about the Lightning General, as he worked under him, and that was the primary reason Lee Shin Woo took the risk of summoning one of the 12 generals.\n[You already gave me your regular report. An invader? So the golems finally... did they show up?]\nThe Lightning General, Hansen Von Dorthe, replied, and Lee Shin Woo spoke in an urgent tone. He wasn’t lying; the situation was quite urgent. Since the Treasure Eater was running wild, in an attempt to swallow him whole!\n\"It’s not the golems. But a considerably powerful monster appeared...!\"\n[The Emperor’s order was clear: execute the golems, who are rebelling against the Empire.]\n\"But the city will fall! If that happens, we won’t be able to uphold the imperial command, General!\" Thıs text ıs hosted at novel✦fire.net\n[...]\nIf the city responsible for protecting the Sanctuary fell, then they would obviously be leaving the Sanctuary unattended. It was such obvious reasoning, so why did he have to think it over so seriously? Lee Shin Woo wondered whether all the 12 generals were idiots.\n[Hoo... Fools. To think you’d be put into this kind of situation from a mere monster... It can’t be helped. I’ll go myself.]\n\"It’s an honor, General!\"\n[Keep as many soldiers alive as possible. If you’re right, then me going is pointless if all your forces, which are meant to protect the Sanctuary, are destroyed.]\n\"Indeed!\"\nHe’d planned on sacrificing his troops to ensure his safety, but Lee Shin Woo didn’t tell him that and cut the line. He hadn’t given the general any particular information on the monster, but it seemed like the general didn’t care.\nWell, he was one of the 12 generals. The 12 generals had nothing to fear in the Empire, aside from the Emperor!\n’Good. A resounding success.’\nHowever, if the general had been told, he wouldn’t have been able respond as calmly as he did. That his opponent, the Treasure Eater, was a high rank level 7 elite, capable of unleashing powerful lightning, as well as possessing Lightning Resistance!\n’The Lightning General, Hansen Von Dorthe, is level 7 and is one of the weaker generals. But because he’s a swordsman who wields a powerful and quick blade clad in lightning, as well as utilizing a powerful element, he’s about as powerful as a level 8 in a one on one fight. Thus, the Emperor uses him as an hitman (a contracted killer). Plus, he’s one of the generals who’s independent and works alone without commanding troops.’\nEven Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t be privy to this detailed information had his Bone Reinforcement been a lower level, or had he not gained two bones from Nellopa rather than one, or if Nellopa wasn’t someone connected with the Lightning General.\nHowever, all the conditions had been met, so he’d acquired plenty of information on Hansen Von Dorthe, and had succeeded in calling him over. He wouldn’t come over with bothersome high rank undead, and his match up against the Treasure Eater was the worst; the Lightning General won’t be able to win easily. If Lee Shin Woo succeeded in pitting them against each other... he would be able to take down both the Treasure Eater, and one of the 12 generals.\nNo. He put all this effort into calling him; he had to take him down.\n’I’m confident I took the best course of action, but... I may die a few times.’\nTo think he actually managed to call one of the 12 generals over here. He thought about how shocked Jin would be if he heard about this, and chuckled. With that in mind, the Treasure Eater shot out lightning once more.\n[Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\n\"Yeah, yeah. I heard you. Jin, get over here quick! I’m dying over here!\"\n\"I’m on my way!\"\nUnfortunately, Lee Shin Woo’s agility wasn’t high enough for him to dodge when fighting against a level 7 monster using its full strength. He attempted to stifle its approach by either using Bone Fortress’s, or spewing Acid Poison, but if he made even one mistake in this intense battle, he’d lose his head!\n\"Heup!\"\nThen, the Treasure Eater struck the floor with its giant tail, shooting lightning spears; at that moment, Lee Shin Woo knew that he couldn’t block the attack. He leapt into the air while the lightning spears struck his body.\nThe Treasure Eater began shooting him with large-scale attacks and its body temporarily stiffened. The fact that only its rotten eyeballs were moving and tracking his movements was truly goosebump inducing.\n\"Get on!\"\n\"Ok!\"\n\"Gyaaaaaaaaahk!\"\nRight when the Treasure Eater could move again, Jin skillfully jumped, approached Lee Shin Woo, and called for him. Lee Shin Woo grabbed onto Jin’s back and did a half-turn, safely landing on Jin’s back! Immediately after, the three landed at a location quite far from Treasure Eater.\n[You have joined up with your partner. Rebellion’s effect are fully shared with your partner!]\n\"Nice. This is perfect.\"\n\"That was really close, you know!?\"\n\"Ueehk...\"\nJin had easily avoided the Treasure Eater’s impressive lightning attack while advancing forward; he then jumped, catching Lee Shin Woo in the air and even landed perfectly... Kratia was reminded once more that Jin wasn’t normal. Her motion sickness was the price she had to pay for underestimating him.\n\"Run slowly... Ugh.\"\n\"Just let it out while we’re running. You’ll feel a bit better that way.\"\n\"If you vomit on my back, then I’m dropping both of you!\"\nJin yelled in astonishment as Lee Shin Woo patted Kratia’s back. Jin decided to ask about their current predicament.\n\"How long do you think we can keep avoiding it for without fighting it directly?\"\n\"Rebellion increased your stats, so... probably as long as we want?\"\n\"You... you’re a good guy.\"\nLee Shin Woo smiled bitterly at Jin’s refreshing reply. It still didn’t change the fact that Jin was level 5, no matter how close he was to level 6, while their opponent was an elite level 7 monster; to think he’d still be able to say something so confidently.\nNo matter how high Jin’s agility was, or how much his stats were increased through the Rebellion skill, the effectiveness of their stats shouldn’t be able to match a level 7’s!\n’Now that I think about it, there’s more to Jin than just his agility.’\nLee Shin Woo suddenly realized. There was more to Jin than just his high agility. Jin possessed several skills that allowed him to use that agility to its very limits, or even beyond its limits. According to him, each of Jin’s reflex related skills immediately increased his speed. Moreover, Steel Heart further increased his mobility, so it made sense that he was still confident.\n\"So why did you tell the undead to back off, Shin Woo? You could’ve sacrificed them to weaken it a bit.\"\n\"I sent them back to the city. Since it’d be better to fight within the city if we want to take advantage of our numbers.\"\nAnd in the process, he stayed behind to keep the Treasure Eater busy, further cementing their loyalty to him. If the undead could still shed tears, then his troops would’ve been sobbing during their retreat.\n\"And I’m going to group up with them soon.\"\n\"So what about those guys? You should be able to control them, right?\"\nOriginally, the Golem Chimeras had been their objective, but now, no one cared about the thousands of Golem Chimeras. Kratia didn’t doubt that Lee Shin Woo would be able to control them and use them to inflict damage upon the Treasure Eater. And if that happened...!\n\"If I can consolidate all our forces into one single force, we may be able to take down a level 7 elite. Since I’m level 7 now too!\"\n\"You really are level 7, huh?\"\nLee Shin Woo thought there might be some truth to Lloyd’s statement regarding Kratia in the chatting channel, but he hadn’t expected her to actually have reached level 7!\nThat meant that she was at the level of a high rank level 6 when they first met. However... he was surprised and knew that she was talented, but it wasn’t something that would change their situation very much.\n\"Mm... It’s not like your plan would’ve changed if you knew that I was level 7 beforehand.\"\n\"Plan? What plan? Isn’t your plan over with now?\"\nJin, who had been busy concentrating on evading the Treasure Eater, stuck his nose into their conversation. Lee Shin Woo genuinely laughed and replied.\n\"You probably wouldn’t know, but there’s one part left of Operation - Bro, why are you there?. I prepared something in case an unexpected, powerful enemy appeared: Plan D...!\"\n\"Plan D...!?\"\nOf course, he was lying his ass off, but Jin was completely fooled and replied in astonishment. Before he explained Plan D, he asked Kratia.\n\"Kratia, something unexpected happened. You could get hurt, so you can leave if you want; I don’t mind. You helped us attack the testing facility, so I can reward you too.\"\n\"Hmm...? I told you, I’m level 7. Didn’t you hear me?\"\nWas he intending on taking her, a level 7, out of his plan!? Her expression was no longer of disappointment; instead, she poked Lee Shin Woo’s back with a face marred with confusion. But because his back was entirely composed of bone, her finger just ended up hurting.\n\"I heard you.\"\n\"What kind of plan takes out a level 7? There’s no way I’d run away unless one of the 12 generals was...\"\nAs expected, she realized midway what his plan was with her impressive intellect.\n\"You’re going to bring one of the 12 generals into this!?\"\n\"One of the 12 generals!? Why would a general come here!?\"\nJin, who had been listening, was startled and yelled! However, Lee Shin Woo smirked and nodded his head.\n\"Yep. I called a general. I know about him through Nellopa.\"\n\"Are you insane!?\"\n\"What are you going to do!?\"\nKratia and Jin were shocked and demanded a clear answer out of Lee Shin Woo, who treated this like he were inviting a close friend over. Jin especially, as he pledged that they would live or die together.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo remained calm as ever. He was actually really nervous, but he was well aware that if he showed his unease, he would just further exasperate his teammates’ own anxiousness.\n\"Listen carefully. The Lightning General, Hansen Von Dorthe, is coming, and he’s one of the generals who works alone.\"\n\"Ah, I heard that there were generals that acted independently, but he’s still a general! He’s on another level, even to another level 7!\"\nTo become level 7, one needed to attain 6,400 total stats, and Kratia had barely made it past that to become a level 7 magician. However, that didn’t mean that every level 7 was the same!\nThose who’d reached 6,400 stats were level 7, but one needed 12,800 stats to reach level 8; and those who were really close to that threshold... like those with 12,799 stats, were still considered level 7. A general would be closer to level 8 than 7!\n\"Seriously, just listen. He specializes in one on one fights, so the Emperor uses him as his personal hitman. And he’s best at using lightning.\"\n\"Lightning...?\"\nHis explanation caused Kratia to furrow her brow. For a while now she’d been vacantly thinking ’a level 7 elite really is different from the norm’ after seeing the level 7 Treasure Eater continuously discharge lightning.\n\"Then, you’re going to make it fight against the general and then...?\"\n\"Even a general shouldn’t be able to take it down so easily when it has such a powerful lightning resistance. Of course, it’ll be tough for the Treasure Eater to take the general down too, but if it gets into a melee fight, then the Lightning General loses his advantage.\"\n\"Well, that’s true, but...\"\nLee Shin Woo was conjuring up some plans that would depend on the situation in case the general was much stronger than he expected. Since he held all the cards.\n\"So what are you going to do, Kratia? You want in or not?\"\nHis final card was Invisible Heart. Even if he did his best and prepared a myriad of strategies, he wasn’t confident that he could take down a big shot like a general without dying in the process.\nBut if Kratia nodded her head... he could replace Invisible Heart with Kratia. With her, it would be a perfect hand: a royal straight flush. He was sure of that.\n\"I’m...\"\nThe great level 7 magician anguished over his offer.\nUltimately, she made up her mind.",

    "content": "<Chapter 25. Hansen Von Dorthe - 2>\n[Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\n\"Shin Woo, you really think we can just leave them like that?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nHe sent Kratia away, and when it was about time that they return to the castle, Jin asked Lee Shin Woo a question. ’Them’ was referring to the Chimera Golems that were still rolling on the floor and grunting.\nThe fact that they were still like that, despite the fact that Shriek of the Dead should’ve worn off by now, must mean that they were suffering from PTSD.\n\"I feel like they’ll just stay like that if we leave them here.\"\n\"They don’t have a part in my plan for the time being. We should just leave them like that.\"\n\"So... you’re saying that you are going to use them later?\"\n\"Of course.\"\nLee Shin Woo nodded his head, as if saying ’wasn’t it obvious? why are you asking me that?’. They were already on a Joker’s stage; they couldn’t leave unless he said so. They would either dance to his tune, or die; he would only allow one of those choices to pass!\nThe Golem Chimeras were comprised of a group of undead that were at least level 5. He was confident that he could inflict damage upon a general, so long as he used them properly.\n\"What if something goes wrong?\"\n\"Well, then I suppose I’ll die a few times or something. Don’t worry about it too much.\"\nJin was well aware of the fact that Lee Shin Woo’s words were just hot air. They exchanged a few words before the battle, and in the process, Jin once again realized just how determined Lee Shin Woo was; then steeled himself as well.\n[Kuwoooooooooooh!]\n\"Keuk. How long do you think it’ll take before the general shows up...?\"\n\"To be honest, even Nellopa didn’t really know how long it’d take for him to show up. But I’m sure it won’t take very long. Since he had plans that would ’let him hold out until the general showed up’, no matter the situation.\"\nLee Shin Woo said, and looked backwards. The Treasure Eater was chasing after Jin and was close to catching them. Light was steadily radiating off its body, and it seemed as though it would let out a big one soon.\n\"Though I have no idea how long we can last against that guy...\"\n\"Why the hell did that thing appear here, when it’s so hard to even find a level 7? You said that there was only one level 7 elite bone in the secret shop!\"\n\"Instead of asking me, why don’t you ask him?\"\nLee Shin Woo was also speechless. This operation was supposed to be relatively risk-free and safe, and he had planned to finish things up without any problems! He’d let the chimeras and the undead destroy each other, and then loot everything in the facility; the fact that things had gotten so out of hand was all because of that asshole Steve.\nTo think that a level 7 Treasure Eater actually existed; even if he had assumed one did exist, how was he to know that that level 7 Treasure Eater would appear right before him? According to his seniors, Treasure Eaters were such a rare species that meeting one was like winning the lottery on Earth!\n\"Since it’s come to this, we have to get that thing to pay us back for making us walk on such a tightrope.\"\n\"Your voice is really scary right now...\"\n[Guoooooh!]\nThen, Steve began attacking. However, Jin was able to avoid it easily by momentarily accelerating; the lightning cannon ball barely missed, and vanished after leaving behind a crater several meters wide. If they had been directly hit by that, they would have been reduced to bone power; they would’ve died on the spot.\n\"...Just one of these would destroy the castle walls.\"\n\"It’s alright. Shall we use the undead as meat shields?\"\nFortunately, it seemed as though that skill wasn’t something Steve could use often, as it was apparent that Steve had gotten weaker; its speed at which it chased them had slowed. While it was slowed, Lee Shin Woo and Jin moved hurriedly and arrived in front of the outer castle walls.\nOne of the soldiers atop the walls, surveying his surroundings, noticed Lee Shin Woo and yelled happily.\n[The lord has returned!]\n[Oh, the lord...!]\n[The lord’s returned safely. Hurry, open the front gate...]\nBut before the undead opened the front gate, Jin let out a ’heup’, and seemed to put pressure in his legs. The soles of his feet, or rather his hooves, suddenly changed shape. Lee Shin Woo caught a glimpse of it, and to him, they looked like spinning helical springs.\n\"Huh...?\"\nDid Jin just get an ability like that one X Fruit!? [1] Lee Shin Woo was astonished, but at that very moment, Jin slammed his feet onto the ground, leaping high into the air. He’d leapt to a ridiculous height in such a short period of time that even Lee Shin Woo was shocked!\nSeeing that, the undead seemed confused, and Jin calmly landed above the castle walls. It was such a soft landing, belying the powerful leap.\n’How’s that?’\n’Awesome.’\n’Hut.’\nJin snorted at Lee Shin Woo’s honest appreciation and was quite happy. It seemed like Jin had been considering various ways in which he could make full use of his ability.\nHonestly, there was a large degree of freedom in the way he could use Steel Heart, which enveloped his body in mana steel, and he’d thought that he could develop it any way he wanted. But... to change a certain part of his body into springs... it was both a simple and extremely effective idea.\n[My lord, isn’t that horse Sir Seta’s...!?]\n[Now that you mention it, I don’t see Sir Seta anywhere. Did he perhaps...]\n\"Sir Seta left this horse to me. He... was a knight who fought loyally for the Empire till the bitter end.\"\n[Ooh...]\nThe knights took the death of this imaginary figure, Sir Seta, hard. There were several holes in his story that didn’t make sense. For example, why Sir Seta had stopped appearing around the halfway point, or how he died, or how he’d bequeathed his horse to the lord. However, those trifling matters didn’t matter to them right now.\n[That monster will fall by our hands no matter what!]\n[That’s not all. We’ll punish those disgusting bastards who invaded the Sanctuary in his majesty’s name!]\n[Follow Sir Seta’s example! Remember his will!]\n[Uooooooooooh!]\nJin didn’t do anything, but his existence managed to boost the morale of the undead. By the time he tilted his head, the pursuing Treasure Eater forcefully rammed into the outer castle wall and showed itself to all of them!\n[Kuaaaaaaaaaaah!]\n[Kuak!]\nThe Treasure Eater, its gigantic body several meters long, had substituted its speed for its weight in order to deliver such a powerful charge! It was truly a horrific impact. It seemed as though the castle walls would crumble then and there, and within the vibrations, Lee Shin Woo yelled out in a calm, confident tone. Charisma was everything to a lord.\n\"Who defends Kadinan!?\"\n[We do!]\n\"Then, defend it! Show that monster that it cannot look down on us!\"\n[Understood!] Orıginal content can be found at novel(ꜰ)ire.net\nJin couldn’t believe his eyes. The knights and soldiers atop the castle walls then took the plunge, free falling to the ground.\nSeveral of the knights had landed properly, but the soldiers let out a horrific sound upon landing, as if that alone would kill them; yet the other soldiers followed suit and took the plunge!\n’What the hell is that?!?’\n’Suicide commandos.’\nLee Shin Woo replied objectively, as he started to push them. He didn’t want to waste the precious knights, so he insisted on fielding the low leveled commoners and soldiers first. With one order from the Lord of Blood and Iron, the city’s undead stood before the castle walls without a speck of suspicion or fear!\n[Guwooooooh!]\n[For the Emperor!]\n[For the lord!]\n[For the... Kuhak!]\nSkeletons from everywhere fell to the ground! The Treasure Eater charged once more, but it collided with the accumulated heaps of skeleton bones, and it had to be satisfied with just breaking through the piles of bones. It was both the result he was praying for and expecting.\nHonestly, sacrificing 100 level 1 or 2 skeletons to stop one of the Treasure Eater’s attacks was well worth it for Lee Shin Woo.\n’You... this is...’\n\"Show them your spirit; the spirit of a warrior who won’t let that monster through!\"\nThose ’warriors’ had already turned into bone, and if one were to look for them, no one would be able to find them.\n\"Take after their courage! Show them that Kadinan will not fall today!\"\n[Uoooooooooh!]\n[We can’t lose to a mere monster!]\n[It’s time we repaid the lord for his grace!]\nThese level 1 and 2 skeletons, which really didn’t serve any other purpose than to be a momentary shield, fell to the ground in droves. However, it didn’t matter. There were about 100,000 skeletons in the city that weren’t part of the army.\n’Good. With this, the inner city shouldn’t fall before that guy arrives.’\n’This isn’t something a human being should be doing...’\n’I’m a skeleton, remember?’\nAnd those dying to the Treasure Eater were also either skeletons or zombies. Lee Shin Woo grinned as the Treasure Eater threw a fit and rampaged at the never-ending additional reinforcements that kept falling from the castle walls.\nIt didn’t matter whether it decided to tackle them with its body or fire its lightning. Because hundreds, if not thousands would come to reinforce them! The Treasure Eater was already quite tired as its fired off several large-scale attacks while chasing Lee Shin Woo.\n[Kuhieeeeeeek...!]\nThe undead would gather and prevent it from advancing, like a rising tide; seemingly realizing this, the Treasure Eater gave up on advancing rapidly and reserved its magic and stamina, as if saying ’let’s see who holds out until the very end’. It seemed like the Treasure Eater had opted to break through the skeletons slowly.\n\"Show that monster that our will is even harder than these very walls!\"\n[Glory to the Emperor!]\n[I will stake my life to protect you, my lord!]\nAnd so, the meat shield plan began in earnest. One by one, the undead climbed up the walls and fell towards the Treasure Eater. The Treasure Eater destroyed those skeletons and accumulated bones...\n’Wow, look at that line.’\n\"Fall one by one! Remember, one by one!\"\nThere was now a queue for skeletons to climb the castle walls. Like they were lining up to ride an amusement park ride!\nJin watched the Treasure Eater that restlessly shattered the skeletons and zombies, as well as the man who sent these skeletons and zombies to their deaths one by one, and thought it looked like a trainer tossing a lion food at a zoo.\n’You’re only doing this because fighting it would be troublesome, so you’re passing on the job to him, right?’\n’You know me too well.’\nLee Shin Woo checked the time and effectively used the skeleton volunteers. 10,000, 20,000, 30,000... In just a few hours, Lee Shin Woo had managed to clear the city of about 70% of the city’s level 1 and 2s.\nWhen they died, they left behind a heaping mountain of bones, and as such, the Treasure Eater would have to put in the effort to destroy the accumulated bones. Since they were bones that contained the very essence of the undead, it seemed as though the bones were more durable than when they were still alive, which caused the Treasure Eater to expend even more energy.\n’You don’t need to collect those?’\n’Level 1 or 2 bones are useless to me now. However, level 3 or 4 bones are different. Jin, you got it, right?’\n’...Are you telling me to go and collect them?’\n’Exactly!’\nOne fortunate aspect of this plan is that even though he was continuously throwing bodies at it, the Treasure Eater wasn’t losing any strength; rather, it seemed to be gradually getting stronger for some strange reason.\nBecause he’d never fought a Treasure Eater for this long before, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t really aware of it, but considering its power, as well as its hostility towards Lee Shin Woo, it seemed as though an increased obsession for treasure gradually increased the power of a Treasure Eater. Perhaps it might be an innate skill of the Treasure Eaters.\n[You’re enduring well! The general will be here soon!]\n[Uoooooooooooh!]\n[My lord, I’ll go as well!]\nAnd finally that time had come. All the city’s low level undead were gone, and now the level 3 and higher elite forces had to intervene. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and yelled.\n[Your tenacious spirits will protect our city, no, our Empire!]\n[You inspire the allied undead through the Instigate skill! The Command skill is temporarily strengthened, and a portion of your subordinates are able to use the skill ’Meat Shield’!]\n[The Intermediate Command skill has become Lv8. All stats have increased by 3!]\nHe’d hit the jackpot again. It was just like with Bone for Bone; a part of his subordinates could use a skill called ’Meat Shield’ that would increase their defense by three times when sacrificing themselves to protect another.\n[I will... protect this city!]\n[My lord, please watch over me!]\nThe skeletons that had acquired the skill fell with redoubled courage. Of course, even though they have three times the defense, their enemy was a level 7. Instead of futilely dying in 1 second, now they would futilely die in 10. Lee Shin Woo watched as they died, and sported a indistinct expression. But inwardly, he was telling Jin what he wanted.\n’Collect them after they accumulate a bit. Before they break. Ok?’\n’You demon...’\nAnd three hours later, when Lee Shin Woo assessed that they wouldn’t be able to stop it from reaching the outer walls, Lee Shin Woo abandoned the outer walls and allowed the Treasure Eater to destroy them as it pleased; they shut themselves in the inner city and began their second siege.\nTime passed by even quicker. All the level 3 soldiers had died, and all the level 4 knights had died as well. At least half of the level 5 Elder Knights had died, and the few level 6 elites they had realized that it was their turn soon and were extremely scared. Then...\n[Ah... You fools...!]\nHe had arrived.\n[1] T/N: Toy Car has a tendency of censoring really obvious references.

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 25 part3",
    "content": "<Chapter 25. Hansen Von Dorthe - 3>\nThe Lightning General, Hansen Von Dorthe rode upon a well embellished skeleton horse and was enraged upon seeing the destroyed outer walls, the ruined city, and the about half-way destroyed inner city.\n[You fool! I told you to save your forces!]\nBefore he even saw his opponent, the Lightning General harangued him! Naturally, Lee Shin Woo had no choice but to likewise reply loudly.\n\"I attempted to save as many of our troops as possible, but because the enemy was so strong... I’m sorry!\"\n[You worthless, pathetic fool! To think that his majesty trusted you and gave you an imperial command!]\nLee Shin Woo acted as meekly as possible and observed the general without giving anything away as he tried to calm the general down. This was the first time he’d been so close to a general ever since he’d met Arema Steelworker!\nThere was still some of Count Nellopa’s memories left remaining, but actually seeing him up close was completely different!\n[Lv7 Lighting General - Hansen Von Dorote]\n[Lv5 Powered Bone Steed]\nFirstly, his steed looked both large and powerful, but it also seemed as though its abilities were far inferior to Jin’s. It seemed as though Jin also came to that conclusion, as he softly snorted with a ’hut’. Is he feeling prideful right now or something?\nBut the Lightning General riding on top of it... let out a dignified air; so much so that the words ’12 generals’ would naturally come out. This power that could only be attained through a balance of strength, magic, and agility! If he fought against him one on one, Lee Shin Woo was sure that he’d lose in 5 seconds. ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ Nove1Fire.net\n’He’s definitely stronger than Guillotine.’\nThen again, there was no way a general would be weaker than a general’s subordinate, even if they were both level 7s. Unfortunately, that was all he was able to find out about him.\nLee Shin Woo figured out that the Lightning General’s stats were about three times higher than his, and no matter how skilled he was at manipulating mana, fighting the general was impossible for him. Though the Treasure Eater was there, he suddenly realized how ballsy he was in calling one of the generals here. But if he couldn’t take the general down, then that ballsiness would just be foolhardiness.\n’In any case, that guy...’\nTo be honest, neither the general’s power or magic was what impressed Lee Shin Woo the most. He was most impressed by how he looked. He possessed a large build and was about 2 meters tall, but outwardly, he looked so similar to a human that one wouldn’t be able to tell the difference.\nHis skin was pale and bluish, and he couldn’t feel any life from it. That was the only evidence that proved that he wasn’t human. The moment he noticed that he hated him so unbearably much!\n[Huh? This guy is...!]\nWhile Lee Shin Woo was busy assessing the general, the general himself finally saw his enemy. Its body was dozens of meters long, and possessed an odd magic... he could tell that its level of strength was unusual.\n[Guaaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\nOf course, the Treasure Eater, who had continued to charge with the intention of toppling the entire city, recognized the new challenger and roared. It was a frustrated cry as if saying ’How long are you going to make things difficult for me?’. Even though he’d just come for the treasure!\n[A Treasure Eater...!? Why is one of those rare monsters here!?]\nAgainst a similarly leveled opponent, a Treasure Eater would always be a high rank elite! Knowing this, Hansen realized that Lee Shin Woo hadn’t called him for nothing.\nHowever, he was a general, and couldn’t show any fear against a mere monster... With that in mind, Hansen raised his sword.\nThe hilt was rather long, and the blade was also quite wide; a bastard sword! The metal that made up the sword’s blade was extremely blue, which reminded him of the hero’s sword, Thunder Lasting before it was transformed into bone.\n[Cry out, Thunderbird...!]\nThe bastard sword vibrated and was covered in a blinding blue light. The sound of sparks almost seemed to make the entire area go silent. That was a general’s magic! He specialized in close combat, so he had thought that perhaps his magic would be low, but a general was a general after all.\nHe shuddered at the general’s ability to concentrate all his magic into one sword and the fearsome power that came with it. The Treasure Eater seemed quite nervous as its body shook. How nervous could it be for it to momentarily ignore its target, Lee Shin Woo, and turn its attention to Hansen Von Dorote instead!\n[Die, you insect!]\n[Guaaaaaaaaah!]\nHansen, who’d finished using his skill, lunged without delay! At that moment, the lightning gathered around his sword shot out in a straight line and struck the Treasure Eater. It was like a laser!\nThe moment Hansen stretched out his sword, it was impossible to dodge the attack. Even Jin thought he wouldn’t be able to dodge it, so a mere Treasure Eater wouldn’t be able to dodge it either.\n[Hoo...]\nThe lightning erased everything in its path, and the moment it struck the Treasure Eater’s head, Hansen assumed that it either killed the Treasure Eater or caused a severe injury, and wasn’t worried in the slightest. However...\n[Ku... Kuhaaaaaaahk...! Kuoooooooh!]\n[What!?]\nThe moment the attack hit, the Treasure Eater yelled so loudly that it seemed like it would tear the world apart; Steve soon turned his anger onto Hansen instead of Lee Shin Woo and screamed. Hundreds of lighting spears surged from the ground and flew towards Hansen!\n[Can this guy resist lightning... Keuk!]\nHe was so flustered that he was hit by the spears directly. His horse, being only level 5, died on the spot, but now wasn’t the time to be worrying about his horse.\n[Kuhaaaahk!]\n[Why did it have to be... Damn it!]\nThe skill that Hansen had put his full power into... Heaven Piercing Thunderbird. He wasn’t bragging, but it was a fatal move that even the level 8 generals would have a hard time recovering from! It wasn’t just the overwhelming mana held within the lightning; the lightning would also paralyze both the opponent’s body and magic as well. This was only possible because of Hansen’s lightning elemental affinity.\nYet, the Treasure Eater had not only received the attack and recovered immediately, but it had also counterattacked as well! Moreover, its own attacks consisted of lightning, so he was sure that this Treasure Eater was both powerful amongst the Treasure Eaters and had the ability to use lightning.\n[How could the rare lightning element be...]\n\"Go! Go! Lightning General!\"\n[Is he making fun of me right now!?]\n\"Do your best, general! Oh, it’s coming from the left!\"\nHansen, who was tense at the realization that his opponent was someone he couldn’t look down on, heard Lee Shin Woo’s loud cheers. Lee Shin Woo was yelling in genuine hope that the general would come out on top, and he couldn’t get pissed right now.\n[Lightning General, please do your best!]\n[I trust you, sword of the Empire!]\nThe surviving undead, influenced by their lord, raised their voices and cheered the general on. He couldn’t help but appreciate the fact that the Treasure Eater was taking him on, as he’d rather fight it than stand there and listen to them. However, their honest feelings were properly passed on to Hansen.\n[You incompetent and loud-mouthed brats... I’ll punish you once I’m finished with this annoying thing!]\nHowever, it wasn’t enough to be fully focused on fighting against the Treasure Eater. Since he couldn’t use his lightning against the Treasure Eater, even a general like him couldn’t take it lightly!\nThe Lightning General, Hansen Von Dorthe stamped his feet on the ground and grabbed his sword with both hands. His sword was infused with an overwhelming magic once more. It was the magic of one of the 12 generals.\n[Even without my lightning, I’m still one of the 12 generals. Insignificant creature! I’ll show you the price of your ignorance and interference!]\n[Kuaaaaaaaahk!]\nHe fought against this ’insignificant creature’ that couldn’t understand what he was saying and found that getting into a proper form was impossible. He gritted his teeth and lunged at the Treasure Eater. And thus, a bloody battle with two high rank elite level 7s began.\n’Nice. Really nice.’\nLee Shin Woo spectated the battle and smiled pleasingly. Lee Shin Woo’s estimation of the Lightning General, Hansen Von Dorthe’s power was spot on.\nOf course, Hansen was still stronger than the Treasure Eater, except for in lightning, as he was one of the 12 generals. But even so, it would take a considerable amount of time before any kind of conclusion was reached.\n’With this, all my preparations for battle are complete.’\nLee Shin Woo grinned at the Drake Horn Lance that secretly rose beneath his feet. He’d infused as much mana into the Drake Horn Lance as possible, but he hadn’t stopped at one; he had five of them.\nThat’s right. He hadn’t spent the time by just commanding the undead to their deaths. He’d summoned weapons beforehand and filled them to the brim with mana in preparation for his fight with the general!\n’Now all that’s left is the Lightning Tooth in my hand.’\nBecause the lord didn’t normally wear armor, he was, unfortunately, unable to equip his armor. However, he believed that to be a boon instead. One hit of those level 7 elites would’ve smashed his armor to bits.\n[My lord. What are those?]\n\"I’ve prepared them just in case the general is in danger.\"\n[Ooh, as expected of you, my lord!]\nPerhaps because the Instigate skill had affected them for so long, his undead subordinates were unfortunately not the least bit suspicious.\nAt first, he’d considered brainwashing them even further and accepting them as Pauls, but the fact that they had so much faith in the Empire and the general caused him to think that changing who they were fundamentally was impossible.\n’If that’s the case, I should start killing these guys.’\nIf these guys couldn’t fight against the general, then they had no use to him anymore. If he just let them be, they could get in the way, so now that the conditions had changed, he needed to take care of them.\n\"Focus on the Lightning General. He is the sword that represents the Empire. He is the shield that protects us!\"\n[Oooooooooooooh!]\nHe used Instigate, inciting them again and again until the undead stopped thinking altogether. The Drake Horn Lances, which were fully charged and radiating with a gentle light, began to move. He needed to be careful so that the general didn’t get suspicious.\nLee Shin Woo was indeed talented in manipulating mana; if not, then his Instigate skill must’ve gotten stronger, ridiculously so in fact, as the undead didn’t even realize what their lord was doing. Until death was at their very doorstep!\n[Kuheok!]\n[Kureuk...!]\nSoon, the death throes of the undead resounded throughout the city; frighteningly, several undead didn’t even notice, as they were completely enraptured by the Lightning General and Treasure Eater’s fight. Then again, the sound of the two level 7 elites fighting was incredibly noisy as well.\n[Guahk...]\n[W-Why...]\nLee Shin Woo controlled the five Drake Horn Lances as they flew through the air freely; the Drake Horn Lances mercilessly shattered the level 5 elites’ heads and crushed their bodies. It wouldn’t be difficult to break their heads and melt them in a single blow if he just added a bit of acid in.\n[Huh...?]\nOnly after everything had gone to hell did the level 6 Knight Leader, Selloin, who had been vacantly watching the Lightning General and cheering for him, notice what was going on and turn his head. He felt like it had gotten quiet all of a sudden and in no time, all of the knights at his side were gone.\n[These guys didn’t even protect you, so why... My lord?]\n\"Haha. As I thought, you’re loyal.\"\nLee Shin Woo was already in front of him. Five Drake Horn Lances were floating in the air, and despite them all aiming for the completely brainwashed Knight Leader’s head, the Knight Leader didn’t suspect him in the least and just tilted his head. Before his eyes... Lee Shin Woo finally released his Disguise and revealed himself.\n[...What!?]\n\"So I’ll send you to him now. Aren’t you happy?\"\nNeedless to say, the disturbed Knight Leader’s eyes shot wide open and when he was about to say something, five Drake Horn Lances simultaneously struck his head and body.\n’Even when it’s rotten, it’s still a herring’. The level 6 close combat elite didn’t die from that and was holding on, but... he thrust his Lightning Tooth into the Knight Leader’s face and the six weapons began to spew out high rank acid poison simultaneously. The Knight Leader couldn’t do anything and just melted away.\n[You have acquired 174,880 Perium.]\n[You have acquired the Kadinan Knight Leader, Selloin’s arm bone.]\n[You have acquired the Kadinan Knight Leader, Selloin’s sphenoid bone.]\n\"Awesome.\"\n\"You’re really...\"\nWith this, all of the undead in Kadinan were completely taken care of.\nNow, it was time for him to deal with the two happily rampaging level 7 elites.",

    "content": "<Chapter 25. Hansen Von Dorthe - 4>\nLee Shin Woo released his ’lord cosplay’, betraying the guilt-free skeletons and massacring them. Yet the Lightning General and the Treasure Eater had no idea, as they were still fighting against each other.\nThe Lightning General didn’t have the time to look away, as his opponent was freakishly strong and tenacious!\n[Kyahaaaaaaaahk!]\n\"Tch. What’s making you so desperate?]\n[Kuaaaaaaaaah!]\nSince they both knew that lightning wouldn’t work on each other, they instead used their mana purely to reinforce their bodies. It seemed as though both were thinking ’why did it have to be him?’, regardless of who was more intelligent or not.\n[Die!]\n[Kyahak!]\nHansen swung his bastard sword with enough power to topple a mountain, and the Treasure Eater matched his reinforced blade with a reinforcement of its own; it concentrated its mana into its tail to reinforce it, and then used it to block the incoming sword!\nThe moment the sword and tail met, there was a large boom and the land quaked; the entire area sunk. Their collision caused the geography of the land to change; so much so that either side had the credentials to be called a calamity.\n[Tch, another draw...]\nThough it was frustrating for Hansen to admit, their strength was about equal. Hansen possessed higher strength and agility, but the Treasure Eater was a monster that possessed an unusually high amount of magic, even when compared to other like-leveled monsters! It covered its weakness in strength and agility with its magic, and as a result, they were evenly matched.\nIf that’s the case, then killing it quickly was no longer an option. He’d have to take advantage of its mistakes and cause it to accumulate injuries over time. If not, then he’d have to use large scale techniques... he was going to continue like this for now and observe.\n’There’s no way a monster like this would appear anywhere... There’s still something here that I don’t know about.’\nA Treasure Eater wouldn’t appear in a place devoid of treasures. The item had to be amazing to entice a level 7 Treasure Eater... Hansen thought of taking the treasure that the Treasure Eater was hoarding, as well as the treasure that it sought.\nWith that in mind, Hansen was relieved that he hadn’t reported to the Emperor regarding this excursion. He’d thought that it was unnecessary to bother the Emperor when it wasn’t regarding the golems’ capture, yet it was an opportunity for him to get something on the side!\n’Is it the lord? Yeah, he had to have obtained a treasure recently.’\nHe’d already figured out prior that the Treasure Eater’s target was the lord. The lord must be happy that he can use him to take care of the Treasure Eater, but after he’d taken down this guy, he would snatch that treasure off the lord’s hands as the price for telling a general to come to him!\n’So, smile while you still can... Huh!?’\nHowever, during the small moment after he’d dodged the Treasure Eater’s charge, Hansen turned his attention to the lord atop the castle walls and couldn’t believe his eyes. To the point that he believed that his eyes had finally rotted away completely after dozens of years of being an undead.\nThe lord who was smiling and looking down from the castle walls was... completely different from before! Especially because the skeleton, who stared back at him with black goblin fire in his eyes while riding a horse, possessed power that caused him unease, albeit for a mere moment.\n’W-What’s this!? Is that the lord? Plus, I don’t see any of his subordinates atop the castle walls; am I seeing things wrong? No, I remember the lord’s face and energy; I remember everything!’\nAll beings possess an inherent energy that they cannot change. That is represented by magic. Even though there were cases where the shape of mana continuously developed, changed form, and developed again, it wasn’t possible to instantaneously change its fundamental nature.\n’But that guy is... Kuheok!’\nIs it because he paid too much attention to this unbelievable situation? Hansen was hit directly by the Treasure Eater’s body tackle and was thrown into the air. He wasn’t the only one aiming for his opponent’s weaknesses; the Treasure Eater was as well. Because Hansen was so shocked, he had momentarily forgotten about the current battle!\n’How...?’\nOnce he’d been struck by the Treasure Eater and was thrown into the air, he barely managed to land and return to a proper stance. Even so, Hansen couldn’t take his mind off of Lee Shin Woo. Even as he swung his bastard sword and blocked the Treasure Eater’s charge, he continued to think about Lee Shin Woo.\n’How did he disguise himself as another? If that’s truly possible, then when did he start? Was it when he called me? No, it shouldn’t be that easy to release the lock on the communication device...!’\nThe more he thought about it, the less he understood his current situation. No matter how he thought about it, he came to the conclusion that ’it was impossible’! Of course, it was Lee Shin Woo’s ability that had caused the general such confusion. That’s what it meant to step onto the Joker’s stage.\n[Kuaaaaaaaah!]\n[Tch...!]\nUntil now, Hansen had a slight advantage against the Treasure Eater, but because of his confusion, the tides of battle had turned. The Treasure Eater rushed him, as though it was capitalizing on this opportunity. Even though he knew that he shouldn’t get distracted, his head was still in the clouds.\n’Did I fall for a trap? If so, then who’s? Is it Anti-Skull... No, that’s unlikely. Then the golems? Is it Arema Steelworker? Yeah, it wouldn’t be impossible for them to make a golem with such a strange ability...! The one thing I’m sure about is that that skeleton isn’t the mastermind behind all this.’\nFrom that point, Hansen had already gone astray. He couldn’t believe that Lee Shin Woo had planned this all by himself and surmised that there had to be someone behind him!\nBut unfortunately, Lee Shin Woo no longer made him feel afraid or tense. Rather...\n’...There’s no point in thinking about this anymore by myself. Pull yourself together, Hansen!’\n’Even if it’s rotten, it’s still a herring.’ No, actually it’s a general. He halted all thoughts that came about from this chaotic situation and instead raised his fighting spirit.\nRealizing early on that using his brain isn’t his job, and focusing on what he’s good at is. That was the first thing he realized in his life!\n’It doesn’t matter. Whoever it is that’s pulling the strings... I’ll show them that a general isn’t to be taken lightly...!’\nAt the very least, the only level 7 he could sense here was the level 7 Treasure Eater. If that’s the case, then it didn’t matter what obstacle he faced; he would be able to overcome it with his strength. He, the Lightning General, was sure of it. He possessed the strength that would make that possible!\n’No matter who it is or what they do, I’ll just burn them to a crisp...!’\nOnce he was finished taking care of the Treasure Eater, the skeleton atop the castle walls with chaotically burning goblin fire was next. He was surprised by the fact that he had been vexed by the lord just a little while ago, as he was sure that the lord wouldn’t be able to match him in strength.\nOf course, there was something that was waiting for him after too. But it didn’t matter. They would burn from his lightning!\n[I’ll burn you and break you into pieces! Witness my true strength, the strength of the Lightning Shadow [1] General, Hansen Von Dorthe!]\nHe fended off the Treasure Eater, and the moment it was pushed back, Hansen’s body was covered in lightning. If he knew that lightning was useless against his opponent, then why? Of course, the lightning wasn’t for an attack.\n[Watch, you insignificant creature. This is how you use lightning...!]\nHe forcefully discharged the lightning and slowly gathered the lightning inside his body. At the same time, his body started becoming fainter and fainter!\nNo, it wasn’t becoming faint. The lightning covering his body was rotating much too quickly and was emitting sparks; he was making it so that it was difficult to see where his body even was. In the midst of that, his body and mana surpassed their limits, and it was almost as if his body and the lightning had become one.\n’Holy shit, that’s really intense...!’\nSeeing that, Lee Shin Woo held his breath. Lee Shin Woo had never met anyone outside of monsters with such a strong elemental affinity, and it goes without saying that Hansen’s technique interested him. From the position of someone who could use the lightning element, he couldn’t miss a single moment of this!\n[This is... true lightning!]\n[Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\nLightning Shadow described a lightning so powerful that could only be seen as a shadow. It wasn’t merely something like attacking quickly and covertly. The key point of this technique was to hide one’s body within the powerful energy!\n[How much longer do you intend to trouble me for... Die!]\nIt was difficult to even ascertain the true nature of the technique, and it was similarly difficult to avoid it or defend against it. Even if he possessed lightning resistance, it couldn’t be easy to focus that tremendous magic and heat, that surpassed that of ordinary lightning, into a single point!\n[Kyaaaaaaaaahk!]\nThe Treasure Eater channeled its energy in an attempt to resist. However, before its defenses were ready, Hansen forcefully struck out with his bastard sword. The energy surrounding his bastard sword made it look like a several meter long greatsword. No, it was like the lightning of a god that descended onto the mortal world!\n[Ki-Kihik...]\n[Hoo.]\nHansen had pierced a giant hole in the Treasure Eater. Seeing that outrageous sight, Lee Shin Woo thought that he might’ve made the wrong decision. That attack that the Lightning General had unleashed wasn’t something that could be blocked with mere lightning resistance.\n’Then I guess I really will have to be prepared to die one or two times... Huh?’\n[Guu... Guuooooooooh!]\nBut then, the Treasure Eater showed its own secret weapon. Hansen grinned from landing such a huge attack, but the Treasure Eater then spawned dozens of tentacles from its injured area that attached to Hansen.\nLee Shin Woo thought ’I’ve seen that somewhere before’ as the tentacles wriggled around, sucking Hansen’s energy.\n[Kuahk!?]\n[Kuhuaaaaaaaaah!]\nBoth Hansen and the Treasure Eater screamed. The Treasure Eater absorbed the powerful lightning that surrounded Hansen’s body and was healing its injuries! Absorbing elemental power was an offshoot of an element; it wasn’t just the Lightning General who had been waiting for his opportunity.\n[You... You bastard!]\nHansen, who’d lost a tremendous amount of energy, swung his bastard sword, and severed all of the attached tentacles. There’s no use crying over spilled milk. The Treasure Eater had almost fully healed the injury it had sustained by absorbing Hansen’s mana.\n[You dare... push me this far!]\n[Kihaaaaaaaah!]\nLee Shin Woo watched both Hansen and the Treasure Eater as they gasped for breath; both of them had run low on magic and health. And judged strictly, earnestly, and solemnly.\n\"Mm, this is a draw.\"\n\"I was wondering why you weren’t saying anything.\"\n\"But more importantly, Jin, it’s about time we started moving.\"\nIf one were to ask if Lee Shin Woo was just leisurely watching the fight, then the answer would obviously be no. He had absorbed all of the level 5 and level 6 bones from his betrayal (he’d stored all of the level 3 and 4 bones in his inventory, which totaled in the tens of thousands), and increased his stats significantly. At the same time, he had infused the Drake Horn Lances with his replenished magic and had been waiting for the right time.\n’Two, three, four, five... My armor’s all set too.’\nHe had the five Drake Horn Lances, and because he had returned to his original form, he had unsummoned the Lighting Tooth and had instead summoned his armor set. He decided to act when he had finished infusing his armor with magic as well!\n\"They went back and forth, but the general’s still stronger, right?\"\n\"Yep. If it keeps going on like this, the Treasure Eater will definitely lose.\"\nAnd from Lee Shin Woo’s position, that wasn’t a very fun conclusion. It was time to add another variable.\n\"Alright... Finally, it’s time to set [Operation - Bro, where are you going?] into motion.\"\n\"Man, all that means is that we’re running.\"\nAs expected, he didn’t get fooled anymore. Lee Shin Woo clicked his tongue and got onto Jin’s back. He’d collected all of the bones and had finished absorbing them as well, so there was no point in being here any longer. Jin jumped from the castle walls and began to run!\n[Huh!?]\n[Guoooook!?]\nTheir destination was obviously where the Golem Chimeras that were experiencing PTSD and rolling on the floor came from... the Sanctuary, the Empire’s testing facility!\n[1] T/N: Naruto reference to Raikage (Lightning Shadow). Lightning Shadow General is more literally correct than Lightning General now that Toy Car has given us the Chinese characters (雷影).\nThᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn novel•ﬁre.net",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 25 part5",
    "content": "<Chapter 25. Hansen Von Dorthe - 5>\n[That heretic!]\n[Guaaaaaaaaaahk!]\nAt Lee Shin Woo’s sudden departure, the Lightning Shadow General and the Treasure Eater, as if under mutual agreement, halted their fight and chased after him.\nHowever, one of them was nigh depleted in magic, while the other had just recently recovered from a critical injury. Jin utilized all his Sprint skills simultaneously while fully charging himself with the surrounding mana, and ran at an outrageous speed, so even a level 7 elite wouldn’t be able to catch up easily.\n\"The Rebellion skill is really amazing...!\"\n\"More running, less talking!\"\nLee Shin Woo’s Rebellion skill was at level 3. And whenever the Rebellion skill leveled up, its effect would increase by 2%; that 2% definitely wasn’t something to laugh about.\nHis stats, which were passively increased for no other reason than the fact that he was a skeleton, had gone from a 10% increase to a 14% increase. And the increase from fighting a high leveled enemy right now was also 14%!\nHe also gained another 9% because he was with his partner, which totaled a stat bonus of 37%; that entire effect was likewise applied to his partner, Jin, as well!\n[You’re good at running away... Stop right there!]\n[Kyaaaaaaaahk!]\nOf course, when the Lightning Shadow General and the Treasure Eater had fully recovered, they should be able to catch Jin eventually, but they wouldn’t be running away forever, so it was ok. That’s right, soon... He could see it!\n[No, you can’t!]\n[Don’t stick that in my body! Guaaaaaahk!]\nThey passed the dense forest, arriving at the vacant lot and were greeted by the ’happy’ faces of the Golem Chimeras. Thousands of Golem Chimeras were rolling on the floor and were letting out such agonized cries that a weak-hearted man might faint on arrival.\n\"Ah, like I thought, they’re still like this.\"\n[You bastards... I’ve finally caught... Huh?]\nImmediately after they arrived at their destination, the vacant lot, Hansen Von Dorthe drew close, and was momentarily speechless when he saw that there were people here before him. The Golem Chimeras looked so horrendous that even he, who had witnessed countless monsters before, felt queasy, but it felt like he’d seen them somewhere before...!\n[Guaaaaaaah!]\n[Tch, you annoying bastard!]\nBut when it felt like he’d found a clue, the Treasure Eater rushed into the lot and attacked Hansen, so he couldn’t afford to be immersed in his thoughts any longer.\nThere were probably several reasons that the Treasure Eater attacked Hansen first, rather than its target, Lee Shin Woo, but the primary reason was that it needed to ’take care of the dangerous one first and then it would be able to eat at its leisure’.\n[Guoooooooooooh!]\n[You dull monster...! You were used by that skeleton too!]\n[Guaaaaaaaaahk!]\nObviously, speech didn’t work against a monster. Hansen gritted his teeth and faced the Treasure Eater. Hansen knew that he needed to take down the Treasure Eater as quickly as possible, as he didn’t know when Lee Shin Woo would start running again.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo didn’t run away. This was his destination. The Golem Chimeras right before their eyes were his targets. He slightly straightened his neck out and steeled himself.\n[Activating the Acting skill, the Disguise skill, and the Instigate skill simultaneously. Effectiveness of each skill increases exponentially.]\nThen, the moment he got back onto the stage...\n[You guys!]\nLee Shin Woo’s voice caused Jin to tilt his head. That definitely wasn’t Lee Shin Woo’s original voice. If that’s the case, where did he hear it before? He definitely recalled hearing it before from somewhere, but he didn’t know from where.\n[How long are you going to act so pitifully?]\n[Gu...aah...]\n[That... voice...]\nThe low and dignified voice. Strangely, the Golem Chimeras, which had been rolling around till now, responded to that voice.\nThey stopped rolling around and flinched, but it was shocking compared to before, when they ignored any and all external stimuli.\n[Wait, you... that voice...]\n[Kuaaaaaahk!]\n[You bastard, are you serious!?]\nWhat’s worse, the Lightning Shadow General, Hansen Von Dorthe, reacted as well! Of course, the Treasure Eater attacked immediately after, taking advantage of his lapse in attention, which forced the general to focus on the fight once more. When Jin saw that, he got a sense of who Lee Shin Woo was imitating.\n\"That voice... is it Arema Steelworker’s?\"\n[Rise, you fools! Those who made you like this still live and walk this earth, so where do you think you’re running off to!?]\n[General...!?]\n[T-This voice is...!]\nThat’s right. Lee Shin Woo was imitating Arema Steelworker’s voice! Of course, he never acquired records of Arema Steelworker, but he had some experiences with him, albeit indirectly, so he could imitate him, just not perfectly. Though his impersonation didn’t need to be perfect!\nHe just wanted to wake them up, and drag their conscious minds to the surface. That much was enough of a success.\n[R-Revenge...]\n[Revenge... on whom...?]\nAs expected, Arema Steelworker’s voice affected them, and there were more and more Chimeras that regained their cognitive functions. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo continued speaking even more passionately. The Acting skill and the Instigate skill harmonized together, and he infused his magic into his voice!\nThe Chimeras’ minds had dimmed from the Shriek of the Dead, and Lee Shin Woo pieced together their egos through sheer will. It wasn’t actually that hard.\n[He who compelled your loyalty and sacrifice...! The one who made you like this, despite knowing the experiment would fail! The Emperor still lives in the Empire!]\n[Y-Yes..]\n[The one who made us like this...]\n[Making us neither dead nor alive...!]\n[B-But I’m still loyal to the Emperor... Yet he’s the one who...!]\nThat wasn’t something Lee Shin Woo should say, as he had pushed countless of Kadinan’s undead to their deaths to sacrifice themselves for him, but unfortunately, the Chimeras had no idea of what he did!\n[What did your Emperor give you in exchange for your loyalty? He gave you that rotten flesh and a golem’s heart! He does whatever he pleases with your loyalty, and when you had no further use to him, he even tried to discard you! You and the facility were buried; that’s the truth!]\n[He’s right...]\n[The Emperor... didn’t even ask me...!]\n[Keuk, Guheuk!]\nOf course, that might’ve not been the Emperor’s intention at first. How would Lee Shin Woo know what the Emperor was thinking at the time? But in any case, all of them came to the same end. The result. The only thing that matters is the result! When the process disappears, then the result is all that’s left!\n[You need not blame yourself or regret. Rise! Rise up and take your revenge! Take revenge on all of those who used you!]\n[He’s right.]\n[We’re in such pain, so why are they...]\n[I want revenge.]\n[I’ll take my revenge!]\nA portion of the once squirming Chimeras rose up. Whether they were a golem or a corpse, their twisted faces were enraged. However, that wasn’t enough for Lee Shin Woo. He knew that he’d be able to make all of them rise.\n[Rise up... Take your revenge! Are your wills not the same!?]\n\"Hey, you’re acting totally like a villain.\"\n[Regain the spirit you thought long dead. Fill your empty hearts with your will. The will of revenge!]\n[Revenge...!]\n[Revenge!]\nHe stopped talking with Arema Steelworker’s voice now. To be more specific, he was Paul Zero speaking to his subordinates now. There was no reason to worry himself over his voice anymore. Lee Shin Woo had awakened all of their egos, and the Chimeras themselves began to motivate each other!\n[What the hell is that bastard doing right now...!]\n[Kuhwahk!]\n[Keuk, so you’re giving it a last-ditch effort... Fine, I’ll end you soon!]\nWhile Lee Shin Woo was diligently brainwashing the Chimeras, Hansen was hard at work fighting against the Treasure Eater, and finally had a chance to win.\nHe knew that the Treasure Eater possessed the ability to absorb lightning, so he was careful to stay far away except for the moment he attacked, and would cut the tentacles beforehand. He caused the Treasure Eater to steadily accumulate damage and then hit it with a large-scale attack skill! If he were an ally, Lee Shin Woo would compliment him, saying it was a perfect attack.\n’I need to turn it around...!’\nThe Treasure Eater was already halfway dead. Noticing this, Lee Shin Woo felt rushed. If he used the general to kill the Treasure Eater, it might become an achievement, but it would just be stealing the last hit after calling him all the way over here!\nHe hastily yelled.\n\"One of the Emperor’s spies is over there. While you guys were floundering around in your own delusions, he’s been living and enjoying life. Are you just going to leave him be?\"\n[No, I can’t...]\n[I can’t forgive him. I’ll make him experience the same despair we did...!]\nThere were still some Chimeras who were idling around, but there were also those who awakened early on and followed Lee Shin Woo, causing others to follow suit. Lee Shin Woo’s voice, which goaded them with one single emotion, was way too enticing for those who had roamed around and lost everything!\n\"Take your revenge! I’ll help you!\"\n[I’ll take my revenge...!]\n[I’ll take my revenge!]\n[Kuaaaaaaaaaah!]\nBut then, something shocking happened. One of the Chimeras who had regained his mind seemed to grab a hold of one who hadn’t yet, and his core radiated an extraordinary light... Following which, the core devoured its body!\n[Lv6 Chimera Golem (+1)]\n\"Wait, I’ve seen that somewhere before...?\"\n\"Shin Woo, that’s suddenly happening everywhere!\"\nThe high leveled Chimeras possessed a clearer ego than the lower leveled ones, and they were the ones most affected by Lee Shin Woo’s voice. Then a few of those high leveled Chimeras began absorbing other Chimeras.\nThey didn’t discriminate among a golem’s core, a golem’s body, or a human’s body. Those absorbed would either disassemble into mana, or attach onto the surface of their bodies, increasing the respective golem’s energy. Lee Shin Woo could tell that that kind of fusion was only possible because of the cores, as he saw the cores radiating light.\n\"Ugh... That’s disgusting.\"\n\"They’re in the process of (forcefully) inheriting their comrades’ wills. It’s such a cool sight.\"\nThere were definitely thousands of Chimeras at the beginning, but their numbers had dwindled sharply as the fusions occurred everywhere. Lee Shin Woo could guess what would happen next, and as he expected, there was a sudden surge of black light from the middle of the crowd!\n[Lv6 Chimera Avenger (Elite)]\n[Lv6 Chimera Avenger (Elite)] The most update n0vels are published on ɴovelfire.net\nWhenever a light flashed, the Chimeras would absorb dozens of their comrades and would be reborn as Chimera Avengers. Instead of rotten pieces of flesh, they had gained proper bodies as elites!\nCountless cores, golem bodies, and knight corpses were fused into one, and the Chimeras were reborn as elites; their once rotten bodies didn’t look as bad as before because in the process of their rebirth, their bodies reached a state of balance.\n[Revenge...!]\n[My just revenge!]\nThey possessed gray flesh, as though iron and flesh were fused together, and their pupil-less eyes were both red and black. Their backs and shoulders sprouting other arms was plenty bizarre, but it was much better than before, when they were a clump of bodies. One might believe they weren’t even undead.\n[Hooo...]\nAfter countless fusions, there were a total of 38 Chimera Avengers! The strongest amongst them stepped forward and faced Lee Shin Woo. Information appeared above his head that only Lee Shin Woo could see.\n[Lv7 Chimera Avenger (Elite)]\nTo think that one of them would reach level 7. He realized that he’d created something absurd once again and just smiled bitterly. But then, the level 7 Chimera Golem spoke in a subdued voice.\n[We... What should we call you?]\nThere were several voices mixed into one, and made it seem foolish to even attempt to find the root of the voice. Hearing the voice(s) of the golem assuming a no-nonsense pose, Lee Shin Woo was inwardly in a cold sweat, yet replied extremely firmly.\n\"Paul Zero. The one who’ll bestow upon you your new name.\"",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 25 part6",
    "content": "<Chapter 25. Hansen Von Dorthe - 6>\n[Paul Zero...]\nThe level 7 Chimera Avenger repeated him, and nodded his head in satisfaction. Most of the other Chimera Avengers either had four legs or had another two arms coming out from their backs, but aside from his gray skin, or his pupil-less eyes, this Chimera Avenger looked no different from a giant human being.\nIt looked so natural that it was unbelievable that it had been created through the fusion of dozens of knight corpses and golems. Lee Shin Woo felt jealous once more upon seeing its appearance. Could he become like that if he fused with something else!?\n[Then are you going to give us that thing now, a name?]\n\"When those guys are taken care of.\"\n[Indeed. I’ll take care of them immediately.]\nThe level 7 Chimera Avenger nodded his head and quickly assumed a running position. Then, he gripped the spear that naturally came out of his hand. It seemed like there were some traces of being a golem after all.\n’But it does seem like the cores were completely dismantled and absorbed...’\nRegardless of whether one ’thinks’ they know how progression, evolution, and how to control of mana works, they really don’t in this world. Though it had to be good, as things were going his way! Each golem assumed a running posture like the level 7 Avenger, and Lee Shin Woo ordered them coldly.\n\"That guy over there. Stop him, he’s the Emperor’s hunting dog. You don’t need to risk your lives. You just need to keep him busy for a bit.\"\n[Ah, keeping him busy is good and all, but... it doesn’t matter if we take him down, right?]\n\"No, absolutely not. Your priority should be to keep yourself safe. Are you going to stop after taking down just one hunting dog? Our goal is killing the Emperor, not dying here!\"\n[Keuk...]\nThe people who talk like that always end up coming back dead, so one can’t afford to even joke around about that kind of thing. Lee Shin Woo glared and ordered them once more; after seeing the Avenger agree and nod his head, he ran forward with the other Avengers!\n[Keuk, you insects. You dare... know your place...!]\n[The Emperor’s hunting dog. Pay for your sins!]\n[Revenge on the Emperor!]\nAs soon as the 38 Avengers entered into the fray, the once hectic battle turned into chaos. Hansen, who was about to corner the Treasure Eater, was forced into parrying dozens of swords coming at him whilst letting out his frustrations; the Treasure Eater didn’t lose sight of that opportunity and attacked the general as well!\n[You hybrids!]\n[Hybrids huh... and who’s the one who made us into hybrids!?]\n[He’s strong!? Is this guy level 7...!?]\nThe level 7 Chimera Avenger definitely stood out!\nBecause he had just recently evolved into a level 7, he was objectively much worse off in terms of stats than Hansen, but because the Treasure Eater, as well as the other Avengers were attacking and Hansen’s attention was all over the place, he could certainly inflict damage onto him!\n[You’re just the beginning. We’ll tell the Emperor someday as well, that he made the worst decision possible!]\n[This energy is... Are you guys golems!? How dare you refuse His Majesty’s grace and betray him!]\n[How dare you speak of betrayal!]\n[Kuwaaaaaaaaahk!]\nEverywhere, mana and armaments crashed into each other. The Chimeras threw caution to the wind and attacked recklessly, and Hansen couldn’t respond to all of their attacks properly. On the other hand, the Treasure Eater had become relatively safe in comparison, and leisurely attacked Hansen. And that’s exactly what Lee Shin Woo had been waiting for.\n\"Nice. Now the Treasure Eater’s not marked anymore.\"\n\"You sure act so carefree, like you knew that this was how it would turn out...\"\n\"No, I didn’t. But I was hoping to get a similar result through numbers before.\"\nHe’s said it once, and he’ll say it again. In this world, quality is much greater than quantity! The was a really satisfying result to Lee Shin Woo. How could it not be? Since the Chimeras, which he’d thought would be consumables, could be used later on if he played his cards right!\n[All of you, get lost!]\n[No matter what... We’ll kill you no matter what!]\n[Kwaaaaaaaaaaah!]\nThe Chimera Avengers’ intervention caused the battle to turn into chaos instantly. Lee Shin Woo pulled a Drake Horn Lance towards him that was floating in the air, gripped it, and thoroughly surveyed his surroundings. Jin, who’d sensed that the end was fast approaching, turned his back hoofs into springs and prepared to charge.\n\"We’re taking down the Treasure Eater first, right? ...Then when are we going?\"\n\"It’s still a level 7 elite, so just taking it down like that seems wasteful. We’re going right after it expends its energy and hits the Lightning Shadow General with a huge attack.\"\n\"...\"\nJin was speechless at Lee Shin Woo, who spoke as though he saw the future, and he was sure that the Treasure Eater would have no choice but to follow the actions that Lee Shin Woo described. The important part was how they would act following that attack.\nLee Shin Woo knew that he couldn’t kill the Lightning Shadow General himself. Thus, while the Lightning Shadow General was temporarily paralyzed by the Treasure Eater’s attack, Lee Shin Woo would attack. No matter what’s going on with the others, Lee Shin Woo just needed to swoop in, kill it, and run out.\n\"So, Jin. The timing’s really important. In that small moment when it attacks the Lightning Shadow General and turns around to me... we have to get the first hit in.\"\n\"Easy for you to say... Shin Woo!\"\nJin, who had been complaining about Lee Shin Woo’s request, suddenly called for Lee Shin Woo. Like Lee Shin Woo had said, the Treasure Eater was channeling all its mana, and was about to release a huge attack on the Lightning Shadow General!\n[You idiot! Insignificant creature, even till the very end, you’re in the palm of his hand!?]\n[We won’t let you get away!]\n[Grab him!]\nThe Lightning Shadow General had realized what the Treasure Eater was up to, and attempted to block it and counterattack, but the Chimeras got in his way and he couldn’t move as he’d liked.\nWith one strike of his sword, Hansen cut one of the level 6 Avengers to pieces, but then, two other Chimera Avengers held onto his back, keeping him from moving.\n[You insects!]\n[Kuhwaaaaaaahk!]\nThe moment he realized he had been caught, he channeled powerful lightning within his body and flung them away from him, but they had achieved their goal.\nIn that extremely short moment following their skirmish, the Treasure Eater shot a mana shell from its giant mouth, striking true!\n[Keuuuuuk!]\n’Now!’\nHansen screamed and passed out. Seeing that, the Treasure Eater cheered and turned around, but at that very moment, Jin kicked off the ground and ran. Ridiculous acceleration; it seemed as though Jin had almost reached light speed, albeit for just a moment!\nThe Drake Horn Lance in Lee Shin Woo’s hand seemed to radiate red, and turned into a single, giant black horn!\n\"Shadow Horn!\"\n[Kyaaaaaaaaaahk!]\nThe moment of impact, the Drake Horn Lance burrowed deep into the Treasure Eater’s neck area. Lee Shin Woo felt his shoulder and wrist holding the spear creak, unable to withstand the strain. It hurt so badly that Lee Shin Woo wanted to just pop his arm out and throw it away.\nOf course, he wouldn’t even have the time to regenerate it. Since the Treasure Eater, having taken a good hit from its prey, was infuriated, and was drawing its remaining mana to burn him to a crisp!\n[Gugeugaaaaaaaaaahk!]\n\"But it won’t work...!\"\nWhere was Lee Shin Woo’s lance? It was in the area where Hansen’s Lightning Shadow technique had struck. Though it had absorbed Hansen’s lightning and regenerated itself, it wasn’t completely healed. That’s where Lee Shin Woo’s mana infused spear had pierced through.\n\"Melt away!\"\nThat was enough to injure it, but Lee Shin Woo revealed his hidden card. That was none other than his level two High Rank Acid Poison!\nThe lance, which was filled to the brim with mana, exploded with acid poison and permeated the injured area. The rıghtful source is novel·fire.net\n[Gugeuaaaaaaaaaaaaahk!]\nThe Treasure Eater leapt around, as it couldn’t endure the awful pain from the poison seeping deep into its body. However, Lee Shin Woo didn’t stop there. Since he still had four other Drake Horn Lances that were fully charged!\n\"Eat another one!\"\n[Kuaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\nAs if a guillotine fell, a Drake Horn Lance vertically fell from the air and precisely pierced the area that Lee Shin Woo had hit prior. He exploded the lance once again, and spread the acid poison throughout its body once more!\n[Gu...gureureuk...]\nThough the Treasure Eater was a high rank level 7 elite, it couldn’t endure anymore. It had been too much for the Treasure Eater, as it had fought continuously without rest and its body had been injured.\nUpon finding Lee Shin Woo, it had continuously ran, rammed into the castle walls, destroyed 100,000 skeletons, fought against a general, and had its body pierced through once... the Treasure Eater remembered all these past events and rotten discharge welled in its eyeballs. Even though it just wanted the treasure; even though that treasure was right before its very eyes...\n\"You’ve done well, Steve.\"\n[Guaaaaaahk...!]\nLee Shin Woo spoke calmly and opened his palm. The other three Drake Horn Lances floating in the air burrowed into the Treasure Eater’s body, side by side. He didn’t even need to blow them up. With just that, the Treasure Eater had reached its limit.\n[You have safely hunted a high leveled foe using every dirty means possible! But so long as you do not take care of the other calamity that you called here, you will not be properly rewarded for this achievement. If you would like your actions to be legitimized, please defeat him as well.]\nAs he defeated the Treasure Eater, a tremendous amount of Perium dropped, as well as two bones (!); plus, a shiny treasure popped out as well, but before he collected it, Lee Shin Woo saw a message that spoiled the mood. Of course, he had somewhat expected this message, so Lee Shin Woo didn’t let that get to him and collected the loot.\n[You have acquired 7,893,450 Perium.]\n[You have acquired the Lv7 Treasure Eater’s jawbone.]\n[You have acquired the Lv7 Treasure Eater’s rib bone.]\n[You have acquired the Sacrificial Gate. Through Bone Reinforcement, the item is transformed! You have acquired the Lv8 Bone Gate! You have acquired the title ’Treasure Master’. You can now more easily find all the treasure hidden in the world!]\n[The Bone Reinforcement skill has become Lv9! All abilities related to the Bone Reinforcement skill have become stronger!]\n\"What...?\"\nHe knew a treasure would come out of the Treasure Eater, but he didn’t think that that treasure would increase in level through Bone Reinforcement. Moreover, a Bone Gate? This tiny bone is a bone gate? And with that in mind, he relaxed and checked the item...\n[Bone Gate]\n[Lv8]\n[Durability - 1,550/1,550]\n[A treasure that allows one to create a gate leading to a designated area by sacrificing a bone. Currently, the possessor can only create gates leading to areas he is completely familiar with, and it is impossible for the possessor to cross dimensions. As the item is imperfect, the amount of people able to use the gate is significantly limited.]\nAs expected, it was an amazing item befitting the title of ’treasure’. It was a transportation item that wasn’t limited by distance!\nMoreover, its price was bone; though he didn’t know what its previous price was, he had plenty of bones. So for Lee Shin Woo, it was essentially an insignificant price.\n[You dirty son of a bitch... how dare you! You vulgar, wicked insect! How dare you covet what’s not yours!?]\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo collected the loot from the Treasure Eater, he heard a loud yell from behind him. That was obvious the Lightning Shadow General, Hansen’s voice, who had a huge role in taking down the Treasure Eater. However, Lee Shin Woo didn’t even look back and spoke.\n\"You guys can still fight, right?\"\n[Of course.]\n[For... revenge!]\nMore than half of the Chimera Avengers had fallen, but surprisingly, there were only a few who had died. Monsters boasted an odd life force that couldn’t be seen from the outside. This was especially true for the level 7 Chimera, as its life force was extremely healthy while Hansen’s body was damaged, albeit slightly.\nThey quickly recovered and then, they extracted a new weapon and attacked Hansen. There was no one better at buying time!\n\"Nice. Then keep him busy for a bit. Jin, this is yours. Can you absorb it? Even if you can’t, you have to.\"\n\"I wouldn’t have had to absorb it if only one came out. Uaaaaaaaaaah...!\"\nFirst, he stored the Bone Gate into his inventory very carefully, and after quickly using Bone Reinforcement on Jin with the Treasure Eater’s jawbone, Lee Shin Woo absorbed the Treasure Eater’s rib bone. Then, at that moment...\n[Reinforcing your partner, Jin Taylor, by consuming the Lv7 Treasure Eater’s jawbone. You have learned Lv1 High Rank Lightning Resistance. Magic has increased by 15.]\n[Reinforcing your rib bone by consuming the Lv7 Treasure Eater’s rib bone. Health and Magic have increased by 20. Intermediate Lightning has become Lv8. High Rank Lightning Resistance has become Lv2. You have learned Lv1 Element Absorption! Magic has increased by an additional 30!]\n[Guuuuuaaaaaaaaaaaah! (Precious... My precious...!) - Treasure Eater]\nHe’d obtained the final puzzles pieces to defeat one of the 12 generals.\nThough, that’s a lie.",

    "content": "<Chapter 25. Hansen Von Dorthe - 7>\n\"Guaaaaaaaaaah!\"\n\"But you got what you wanted, right?\"\n\"Yeah, I got it, but... Uaaaaaaaaaah.\"\nWhen Lee Shin Woo and Jin were finished with their respective reinforcements and turned around, the Lightning Shadow General, Hansen Von Dorthe felt quizzical, even through the pain left behind by the Treasure Eater’s attack and his anger towards Lee Shin Woo.\n’That guy... He feels different...?’\nIt felt like Lee Shin Woo’s strength had changed from before he defeated the Treasure Eater. But that was impossible if he thought about it with common sense. All Lee Shin Woo had done was take down a monster that he’d brought to near-death, so he shouldn’t have received much karma off of the kill! In fact, it seemed like it would be a negative karma to him instead.\nWhile he did acquire the loot the Treasure Eater left behind, there was no way he could change so drastically. There was no way they’d become stronger as the treasures it had dropped weren’t related to combat.\n\"You’re really tired too, right? Let’s finish this, Hansen.\"\n[You impudent bastard...!]\nBut upon seeing Lee Shin Woo’s confident attitude, Hansen discarded any such inquiries. That strength, which seemed to have changed, felt like an empty boast to him.\n[How dare a mere ant try to reach the heavens!]\nHe was still a lousy level 6, and though he possessed a fast horse, that was all. While Hansen was indeed weakened from the Treasure Eater’s attack, he was still a high rank level 7 general!\nThe reason he looked ’weak’ was because the Treasure Eater hadn’t been a good match for him. This simpleton hadn’t even realized that simple fact and had become reckless; he would just cut him down with a single lightning sword strike!\n\"Dieeeeeeeeeeeeee!\"\n[That’s my line. I’ll kill you with a single strike!]\nThe Treasure Eater, who wasn’t affected by lightning, was already dead. Now there was no reason for him to hesitate using his lightning!\n[Get lost, you insects!]\n[Kuahk!]\n[Revenge...]\nHansen paralyzed the Chimeras that continuously bothered him through a powerful electric discharge, and swung his bastard sword crossways, pushing all of them away. With this, there would be none who could interfere with him, albeit temporarily.\n[Huaaaaaaaaaahp!]\nHansen raised his bastard sword, charged with powerful lightning, and slashed downwards at Lee Shin Woo, who was rushing towards him! The lightning sword attacked Lee Shin Woo with the power to cut both mana and space. ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ n0velfire.net\nSeeing this, Lee Shin Woo hastily blocked it with a ’manufactured sword’, but the moment Hansen’s attack and his sword clashed, the manufactured blade shattered into pieces and a horrific amount of lightning spread through his body.\n\"Kuhak...!\"\n[To take heaven’s fury head on; what a fool. You’re just a greenhorn who doesn’t know his place! ...Huh?]\nHansen chattered on confidently, yet the man he expected to be burnt to a crisp was surprisingly enduring it unscathed.\nThen again, he wasn’t unscathed. Both shoulders were destroyed immediately, and a few of his ribs were broken as well. But the moment Lee Shin Woo took damage, he began regenerating his body, and soon, his body was healed. That was like... like... the Treasure Eater, which had absorbed his lightning and healed its body!\n[You, what is that... Keuk!?]\nHe was taken aback by Lee Shin Woo’s appearance, as he resembled the Treasure Eater he had fought a short while ago, and was careless for just a moment. In that moment, Lee Shin Woo aimed for that gap in his awareness and the Drake Horn Lances flew one after another, burrowing into Hansen’s stomach. Lee Shin Woo had struck where the Treasure Eater’s mana shell had hit him!\n[How...!?]\n’Even if it’s rotten, it’s still a herring.’ The moment he saw an indication that Lee Shin Woo was attacking, he instinctually swung his sword, but there wasn’t just one lance, there were three; and the moment the general was sure of his victory, Lee Shin Woo’s shocking appearance unnerved him, and of the three remaining lances, the general was only able to cut down one.\nWhat’s worse, the moment he split the lance in half, a foul Acid Poison spewed out, and attacked him! As his blade was a treasure, it didn’t melt, but the powerful acid was enough to melt away the general’s armor.\n\"I guess you didn’t see Steve die. Right?\"\n[Tell me, you bastard! How did you stop my lightning...!?]\nLee Shin Woo had regenerated his body in no time, and provoked him. But the moment the infuriated Hansen attempted to yell something, the two Drake Horn Lances inside his stomach exploded simultaneously. It was an obvious sequence of moves.\n[How foolish!]\nThe moment Hansen sensed an extraordinary flow of magic, he created a magical shield that blocked it, but he couldn’t block the Acid Poison created through mana that was concentrated to its very limit.\n[You dirty bastard...]\nHansen’s armor and skin melted away, exposing the rotten flesh underneath, and spurted out rotten, black blood. His exterior had been damaged during the fight with the Treasure Eater, but not on the inside; but Lee Shin Woo, who’d properly taken advantage of the opportunity, was able to see his hideous appearance as a result of his elemental attack.\nThe injured region that was affected by the Acid Poison was especially severe. Because he’d been injured by a lower level opponent, it was a bitter injury in many ways.\n\"Hoo. As I thought, when it gets to the high rank level, it’s effective against a general.\"\n[That’s only because I was weakened... It’s all because of your dirty tricks!]\nNot only was Lee Shin Woo at a lower level, he remained unscathed after taking a direct hit from Hansen’s lightning; he’d even injected Acid Poison into him through a ridiculous trick!\n[I’ll kill you!]\nLee Shin Woo’s provocation was truly effective. If he didn’t tear that bastard to pieces, then he wouldn’t be able to bear it. Hansen’s eyes rolled back and drew upon his last remaining mana to activate Lightning Shadow.\n[You... mocked me long enough...!]\n\"Jin, can you do it?\"\n\"Nope, I can’t. Not possible.\"\nJin, who’d already confirmed that Lightning Shadow sharply increased Hansen’s speed and reflexes, firmly denied Lee Shin Woo. It was so merciless that it sounded heartless.\n[Die... What!?]\nBut it was ok. The Lightning Shadow General was only focused on Lee Shin Woo right now. And that meant...\n[The Emperor’s hunting dog!]\n[You insects!]\nAfter he’d activated his Lightning Shadow and was about to charge at Lee Shin Woo, the Chimera Avengers attacked from behind! Of course, now that all of his abilities had improved significantly, even level 6 elites were mere flies to him, but the problem was the timing. Just maintaining this ability cost a tremendous amount of mana!\n[Get lost!]\n[And who are you to decide that!?]\n[That’s our new lord!]\nIt was extremely simple for him to cut through the Chimera Avengers and move forward. However, the Avengers rushed at him, heedless of their own lives, and cutting through each and every Avenger got him closer to mana depletion.\nUltimately, the Lightning Shadow General became hasty. As all the blood rushed to his head, he realized that he’d made a rash decision, and was now beginning to accept that fact.\n[You... you bastards! You fools that cannot understand His Majesty’s intent!]\n[Remember that despair.]\nThe final obstacle was the level 7 Chimera Avenger. His palm had become a giant shield and he assumed a defensive position; Hansen even witnessed his resolve, that he wouldn’t let anything past him.\n[That deep despair. That’s what made us like this.]\n[Shut up!]\nThe lightning blade cut through the air once more. The giant and durable shield was cut into pieces in one fell stroke, while the Chimera Avenger sustained a deep injury and was powerlessly flung away.\nThough the Avenger had sustained a severe injury, he didn’t die, and following that attack, the last remnants of the general’s Lightning Shadow vanished from his body.\nHowever, there were no more obstacles in his path. Lee Shin Woo was right in front of him. Yet, Lee Shin Woo seemed unafraid and black goblin fire blazed in his eye sockets, as though he were ridiculing him.\n\"You don’t have any more mana, right?\"\n[So what?]\nHansen raised his sword and pointed it at Lee Shin Woo. It was a stance that seemed to convey a heavy strength.\n[Even if I don’t any mana left, I’m still stronger and faster than you. My accumulated stats, as well as my level are proof of that.]\n\"So in any case, you’re out of mana.\"\n[Die!]\nLee Shin Woo nodded his head and Hansen forcefully charged. In the connected state, Lee Shin Woo urgently moved his body and managed to dodge it, but was unable to dodge it completely; a part of his arm was severed. It was truly a powerful strike Hansen could be proud of.\n[I’ll fight you like this for a little bit until I’ve replenished by mana. Perhaps you won’t even be able to last that long!]\n\"Kratia!\"\nAs he dodged the general’s sword strike, Lee Shin Woo yelled boomingly. His shoulder was cut, and his lower jaw was a bit cut as well. One of his fingers went flying into the air. Even his hastily summoned Lightning Tooth was cut apart.\n[Kratia...?]\nThe unfamiliar name caused the Lightning Shadow General to furrow his brow. Was it the name of a technique? An item? If not, then a person’s name? But aside from the scattered Avengers, no one else was here. Only he, the skeleton, and the horse covered in steel...\nBut he thought of it as a bluff, and intended to cut off Lee Shin Woo’s mouth so that he couldn’t talk anymore. He swung his sword once again, but at that moment, there was something that stopped him. Lee Shin Woo struck with his sword and cut through a layer of skin.\n[Keuk...?]\nAt that moment, he felt as though his movements were messed up, and attempted to swing his sword, but once again, his movements felt unnatural. He couldn’t move very well, as if his joints were frozen stiff.\nLee Shin Woo took advantage of that opportunity and this time, his sword cut a part of his fingers! It wasn’t a coincidence. Someone had made him like this. Moreover, his opponent, Lee Shin Woo was entirely unscathed! But then, who was it?\n[Ku...hahk...?]\n\"...Hoo.\"\nHis head creaked and turned around. At the end of his sight, he saw a young girl beyond the testing facility’s doors. She was much too beautiful and pure white, having the appearance of a girl in the winter.\n\"You really did it.\"\n\"I told you the request wouldn’t be so difficult. So how many minutes do we have?\"\n\"5 minutes. If we take into account other variables, then three at most.\"\n\"Ok.\"\nThe winter girl spoke and Lee Shin Woo replied to her. That meant they were working together. It was a fact that the girl was the one making his body like this. But how?\n\"A level 7 magician.\"\nKratia cradled the Eternal Ice that was slowly rotating in the air, spoke briefly, and went back to being silent. It was as though that much of an explanation was enough. And in truth, it was enough.\n’That girl cast such a powerful debuff on me? And that’s the reason this skeleton got me to use up all my mana?’\nThe more powerful one’s magic was, the less likely a debuff would affect them. Thus, debuffs were cast when one’s opponent was weak, so that their success rate was at its highest.\nA debuff was especially effective when one’s mana is depleted... and if that’s the case, that meant that Lee Shin Woo provoking him into using Lightning Shadow was all part of a bigger plan.\n[...Ha, haha.]\nHe was completely tricked. Hansen had thought that there was someone backing Lee Shin Woo, but when he saw him commanding the Chimeras, he thought it was Arema Steelworker... To think that a level 7 magician would appear at this time and cast a debuff on him from an unknown location!\n[5 minutes. You can only be so foolish. If I just survive for 5 minutes, I’ll be able to kill you all!]\n\"Are you an idiot?\"\nLee Shin Woo grinned and spoke.\n\"I prepared so much just to catch you... You don’t think she’s all I got, do you?\"\n[...]\nTo be honest, she was all he had left. If this didn’t work, then he would have to be prepared to die a few times and fight.\n...But Hansen was intimidated, as he’d experienced all those traps that Lee Shin Woo had prepared, so this time, his lie was actually quite effective!\n[I don’t know who you guys are, but... I’m one of the 12 generals, one recognized by the Emperor as the Lightning Shadow General, Hansen Von Dorthe!]\nHe gritted his teeth and tried to raise his sword with his unmoving arm, but as he was disheartened and debuffed, the sword’s edge shook finely. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo grinned and likewise raised his weapon. His weapon soon changed into the shape of a lance, the weapon which first pierced through his body.\n\"I know. That’s why I’m trying so hard to take you down.\"\nLee Shin Woo was filled with a powerful green acid. The moment Hansen saw that, he instinctually predicted his own death, but even so, he couldn’t stop. That was the pride of one of the 12 generals.\nAnd for the first time in a long time, one of the 12 generals was killed.",

    "content": "<Chapter 25. Hansen Von Dorthe - 8>\nLee Shin Woo mercilessly attacked the Lightning Shadow General, whose entire body was frozen stiff; by the end of it, Lee Shin Woo managed to pierce through his neck and kill him without dying once.\n[I am... His Majesty...]\n\"Shadow Horn!\"\n[Kahak!]\nHe thought it might be a bit cowardly, but he nonetheless blew him away as the airborne ice crystals evaporated. Since the result is all that mattered! And the result that appeared right after was...\n[You have hunted a member of the 12 generals, the Lv7 Lightning Shadow General, Hansen Von Dorthe. All contributing heroes acquire 30,000,000 Perium, and all stats increase by 100. You have acquired 10 permits to God’s secret shop. Proficiency in all combat related skills has increased dramatically!]\n[The Intermediate Bursting Thunder skill has become Lv9. Strength and Magic have increased by 10.]\n[The Intermediate Mana Bone skill has become Lv9. Magic has increased by 10.]\n[The Intermediate Shadow Horn skill has become Lv4. All stats have increased by 6.]\n[The Intermediate Command skill has become Lv9. All stats have increased by 3.]\n...\n...\n[Intermediate Ice has become Lv4. Magic has increased by 5.]\n[The Element Absorption skill has become Lv2. Magic has increased by 10. You can more effectively absorb energy from the elements that you possess.]\nThere was a stream of messages that appeared! All the skills that he used in battle, as well as those he hadn’t used in battle, leveled up instantaneously for no other reason than the fact that he had defeated one of the 12 generals.\nThe amount of stats he’d garnered from defeating the general, as well as the stats from his skill level ups, was enough to make his head hurt. But wasn’t this good for him? There were still some messages remaining, notifying him of his growth.\n[You are an excellent example of a Joker! Even in a situation without allies, you faced a variety of enemies and managed to incite them and trick them; in the end, you won ’fair and square’! All stats have increased by 20. The Joker karma has become even stronger. The Joker’s innate skills have grown.]\nAccompanying this message was a notification that his Acting skill leveled up to level 16, as well as his Disguise skill leveling up by two, up to level 6. He knew just how much these skills changed whenever they leveled up and was surprised, almost gaping in response.\nBut thinking about it carefully, a general had stood upon his stage, so he should obviously gain this much.\n[You have received God’s grace. The Invisible Heart skill’s maximum level has increased by 10.]\nHis achievement was rounded off by a present from God. When he thought about it, the quest he’d received from God, which was the quest to hunt undead heroes, increased the maximum level of Invisible Heart as well, but he’d only killed one undead hero (he’d fought against two of them, but he made one of them into his subordinate). This time, the maximum level of Invisible Heart had increased by 10, to a total of 111.\n\"So this means that my lives have increased by 11, huh...\"\nHe thought about it suddenly, and realized that God’s blessing was truly amazing! Lee Shin Woo recognized that God rarely did things out of the kindness of her heart, and just decided to be happy about it.\nLee Shin Woo nodded his head, as Kratia and Jin danced with joy from beside him. Though they weren’t rewarded as much as him, he could tell that they were rewarded based on their contributions. But then, Jin suddenly yelled.\n\"Shin Woo, I’m going to level up!\"\n\"Ah, alright. It’s not dangerous here anymore, so take your time.\"\nJin had barely not reached level 6, and had acquired hundreds of stats as a reward from this battle, so it would be even stranger if he couldn’t level up!\nLee Shin Woo vacantly watched as Jin was engulfed in a sphere of light and leveled up, whilst he neatly picked up the loot the Lightning Shadow General had left behind with his own two hands. To be honest, the Lightning Shadow General was considered an intermediate boss, so he thought it’d be nice if he dropped a bundle of loot, but it was quite cold-hearted.\n[You have acquired 15,230,550 Perium.]\n[You have acquired the Bayran inner map.]\n[You have acquired the Lv5 Divine Lightning Sword. Through Bone Reinforcement, the item transforms. You have acquired the Lv5 Thunder Claw (+5).]\n[You have acquired the Lv7 Lightning Shadow General, Hansen Von Dorthe’s wrist bone.]\nOther than that, he saw an item that looked to be a bracelet possessing tremendous magic. However, Kratia had come over when he called without any complaints and had not only helped with the mission but had also contributed towards defeating the Lightning General, so he decided that this would be part of Kratia’s share.\n\"This is a magic reinforcement accessory! It’s extremely rare!\"\n\"Ah, was it? I thought he specialized in close combat, yet his magic was really high.\"\nAs he thought, leaving that piece of loot as part of her share made her really happy. Lee Shin Woo asked if she wanted him to change it through Bone Reinforcement, but she firmly shook her head. Yep, Kratia was someone who didn’t like taking risks.\n\"Hoo, it seemed possible, but we really beat one of the 12 generals... I knew it, if you’re there, everything becomes dynamic, Shin Woo.\n\"My existence is dynamic, so it can’t be helped.\"\nKratia giggled and said. Lee Shin Woo replied uninterested and examined the last remaining pieces of loot in his hands.\nFirst, the Bayran inner map seemed to detail secret passageways and facilities within some inner city, but he didn’t know where Bayran was or what it was, so he stored it into his inventory for now.\nHowever, the rest was amazing.\n\"As expected, once they become a general, they have to be carrying a level 5 weapon.\"\n\"Ah, this bracelet is level 6, though.\"\n\"Please trade.\"\n\"Don’t want to.\"\nLee Shin Woo suddenly felt regretful. However, Lee Shin Woo used lightning, so even if she did accept his offer, he would have to back out.\nThe original Divine Lightning Sword, and now the Lightning Claw was definitely a treasure that would make the lightning lethal. He felt slightly burdened, as Kratia watched with bright eyes, yet he absorbed it without delay.\n[Recording the Lv5 Thunder Claw (+5)’s information into the Bone Armory. Strength and Magic have increased by 20. The Lightning Tooth and the Thunder Claw’s information have been mixed and have become a new weapon!]\n\"Huuuh!?\"\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo absorbed the Thunder Claw, he sensed an intense change within his insides, or more specifically Bone Armory, and shook.\nOf course, it would be lying to say that he wasn’t looking forward to this. He’d absorbed another lightning element weapon, so if both of those weapons supplemented each other, he thought it might create a greater weapon.\n’But to think it would mix the two weapons’ info and create an entirely new weapon... Kuuuuuu.’\nBone Armory wasn’t something separate from Lee Shin Woo; it was an equipment storehouse within his body. Lee Shin Woo felt a huge migraine coming on due to the intense reaction going on inside. His health, magic, and all of his skills were involved in creating this new weapon.\nCountless information that came from the outside would be combined, and ultimately, a weapon only he could wield would be created. One wouldn’t be able to understand it at all from looking from the outside, but what he was doing was akin to a blacksmith’s work!\n’When I think about it, something like this happened before.’\nThat’s right, the whip. The staff and the whip’s info were combined, creating the Bifurcated Whip. However, it wasn’t this intense of a reaction back then, and perhaps this weapon would be much greater than the whip; in other words...\n[You can now summon the Lv6 Breath of the Lightning God! The Bone Armory skill has become Lv8. You can now summon seven pieces of equipment at a time. Health and Magic have increased by 10.]\nYeah, a level 6 weapon...! As his vague wishes had come true, Lee Shin Woo momentarily observed the weapon and remained completely still. He feared that if he took his eyes off the message, then the weapon would disappear into bubbles.\nBut as time passed, the message automatically disappeared; Lee Shin Woo sighed transiently and raised a hand.\nOf course, he knew that the Breath of the Lightning God’s info was stored in the Bone Armory. Since all the weapon’s info was meticulously recorded in his head! But he couldn’t help the fact that his outstretched hand, which was to summon the weapon, was shaking.\n\"Shin Woo, Shin Woo?\"\n\"I’m finished with leveling up... What’re you doing?\"\n\"I guess he’s going through some kind of ritual we don’t know about.\"\nWhile he shook due to how moved he was, Jin and Kratia became really noisy. Lee Shin Woo completely ignored them and concentrated. To be honest, he didn’t really need to go that far, but he wanted to keep brooding over this item he’d created, but couldn’t adjust himself to.\n\"...Summon.\"\nAfter investing approximately 40% of his mana, (it was 40% after improving his mana, so it was a truly considerable amount) the weapon appeared, revealing itself in all its glory. In many ways, its shape looked more like the Thunder Claw than the Lightning tooth, as it was also a bastard sword.\n\"Oh, oooh.\"\n\"It’s beautiful...\"\nThe pommel was both sharp and black; the hilt was long and uneven, reminding him of a dragon’s scales while the guard took after the Lightning Tooth... And a large blue blade on top...\nThe end converged into a sharp tip, and it seemed capable of both stabbing and slashing.\n\"...Hoo.\"\nFrom an outside view, it just looked like an extremely luxurious sword; the blade could be either bone or metal. Its sheen made it indistinguishable while also making it look distinctive, but... Lee Shin Woo was fascinated by the fearsome energy contained within, especially the electrifying lightning energy within the blade. The others reacted similarly.\n\"Is that the weapon you just absorbed, Shin Woo? No, it’s not. It looks a lot stronger.\"\n\"It is a lot stronger.\"\n\"How’s that possible!?\"\nAfter he’d pried off Kratia, who would always stick to him and watch closely for any mana-related phenomenon, he called for the item’s info. In the process of recreating the weapon, he’d figured out everything there was to know about it and planned it out, but he really wanted to see the official information on it.\n[Breath of the Lightning God]\n[Lv6]\n[Durability: 4,300/4,300]\n[Attack Power: 1,200 - 1,550]\n[Element: Lightning Lv6]\n[Option: Effectiveness of lightning element +50%]\n[Active skill: Thunder Arrow - Summon a lightning arrow in order to attack from long range. The more powerful the user’s lightning and the more mana is infused, the more powerful the skill becomes.]\n\"Ooh, Ooooh.\"\nThis was the first time he’d seen a weapon with an active skill attached! Of course, it wouldn’t be very difficult for Lee Shin Woo, who could use the lightning element, to create lightning arrows and shoot them, but it felt completely different when the skill was included with the weapon!\nMoreover, the skill becomes stronger as his lightning element becomes more powerful. This was an advantage that could only be seen in standardized skills. It was funny to say, but it felt like he’d finally attained an item that befitted a fantasy protagonist.\n\"I want to test it out, but... I probably shouldn’t right now.\"\nLee Shin Woo smacked his lips after he’d securely fastened his summoned sword to his waist.\nBecause he’d infiltrated the city on arrival and had so much to do afterward, he hadn’t been able to rest properly. He had struggled, as he had fought against the general face to face, even though Kratia had cast a debuff at the last minute.\nEven if he was just barely grazed by the general’s sword, his arm would fly off and his ribs would be crushed, so regenerating it all was a pain. It had been a really good learning opportunity; a general isn’t a general for nothing...\n\"Ah.\"\n\"What’s wrong, Shin Woo?\"\n\"...I forgot I said I’d look after those guys.\"\nHe had completely forgotten about the Chimeras and finally remembered after rejoicing over the loot. When he looked back, the Chimeras Avengers were laying on the floor exactly like before.\n\"They weren’t dead?\"\n\"Don’t kill off my subordinates as you please.\"\nKratia tilted her head. After Lee Shin Woo had smiled bitterly and replied, he walked over to the Chimera who looked to be in the worst condition... the Lv7 Chimera Avenger.\nHe thought it might feel unsatisfied that he hadn’t looked after him following the battle, but there was nothing but cheer coming from his face.\n[Were we able to... do our duty?]\n\"Yeah. Because of you, I was able to kill one of the Emperor’s agents.\"\n[Very... good. Your strength and your intellect... I’ve decided that you are good enough to serve as our Lord. So...] Content orıginally comes from novel~fire~net\nThe Chimera Avenger spoke. Not just one, but all of them simultaneously. It was a frightening sight, as only their heads turned to face him as their bodies remained on the floor.\n[[Now, please give us a name.]]\n\"Alright, I’ll give you one.\"\nLee Shin Woo nodded his head seriously and calmly spoke.\n\"Your name is Chi Paul.\"\n[Chi Paul...! Henceforth, I will be Chi Paul and serve you! Until the day we kill the Emperor, no even beyond that!]\nLee Shin Woo’s face didn’t even hint at his true feelings as he nodded his head, firmly accepting Chi Paul’s resolution.\nChi Paul was deeply touched by his name, but Lee Shin Woo couldn’t tell him that the ’Chi’ was just short for Chimera.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 25 part9",
    "content": "<Chapter 25. Hansen Von Dorthe - 9 [End of Volume 5]>\nAside from the seven Chimeras that had died in battle, Lee Shin Woo named the remaining thirty-one Chimeras Chi Paul to Chi Paul 31.\nBecause they were already elites, they didn’t evolve again, but surprisingly, their stats increased slightly followed by a change in their information. Lee Shin Woo was suddenly shocked at how much power a name held in this world.\nEven so, he hadn’t planned on putting much effort into their names. So long as he could tell them apart, any name was fine.\n\"Chi Paul 31, you’re the last one.\"\n[I see... seven of us died.]\n\"It’s more impressive that only seven of you died against that ridiculous guy.\"\nHe reinforced the weakest seven Chi Pauls with the bones of the fallen Chimeras, and used a portion of the bones he’d accumulated to heal their wounds. After healing them, the Chi Pauls looked at him as if he were a mother bird, and began to respect Lee Shin Woo.\n[As expected, you are indeed qualified to say that you will kill the Emperor.]\n[His power has changed since defeating the Lightning Shadow General. It’s almost like he lives in a different world from us.]\nOne of the Chimeras pointed out sharply, but Lee Shin Woo ignored them. And he returned to the task he’d put off, as he had to take care of the Chimeras. Absorbing the Lightning Shadow General’s wrist bone!\n\"The Lightning Shadow General, a higher ranked bone than even the Treasure Eater...\"\nHe’d absorbed a Giant’s level 7 bone from the shop before, and while the giant was quite powerful, he was no match for either the Treasure Eater or the Lightning Shadow General. The reason his stats had increased so much was because he was just that weak at the time.\nThough he’d gotten quite a lot stronger since then, the Lightning Shadow General’s bone may surprise him and increase his stats significantly...!\n\"Ah, there may be a bit of a backblast, so keep an eye on me.\"\n\"You can count on me.\"\n\"So all I need to do is watch this woman so that she doesn’t do anything strange to you, right?\"\n\"Jin, you really are a rude gi... person.\"\nLee Shin Woo remained quiet, and felt a bit left out as he watched a horse and a person converse.\nAs he was a skeleton, he wasn’t thinking about getting a beautiful girl to like him, or to pursue a serious relationship, as there wasn’t any reason to do so. But he didn’t think he’d be beat out by Jin too, who was a skeleton horse!\n\"It seems like Shin Woo’s thinking about something strange again.\"\n\"...My condolences.\"\n\"Alright... Bone Reinforcement!\"\n[Executing Bone Reinforcement by consuming the Lv7 Lightning Shadow General, Hansen Von Dorthe’s wrist bone.]\nHe ignored their chat and boldly executed Bone Reinforcement. The Lightning Shadow General’s wrist bone in his hand began to spark and disassemble, and was then absorbed into his body. At that moment, his mana momentarily transformed into pure lightning!\n[Your interior energy has been activated to its very limit! The Intermediate Lightning Element has become Lv10, and has evolved into the high rank level! You can utilize lightning more naturally than before, and your resistance to it has been strengthened as well. Magic has increased by 30.]\nHis intermediate level 8 lightning element had leveled up twice in one go and had evolved into a high rank skill!\nLee Shin Woo knew how wide the gap between an intermediate level skill and a high rank skill was, and cheered at the improved quality of his lightning. But surprisingly, this was just a by-product. Now Bone Reinforcement’s usefulness would really come to play!\n[You have acquired a skill with great success, as your affinity with the target is incredibly high! Strength has increased by 30 and Magic by 45. Absorbing Hansen Von Dorthe’s experiences and memories more deeply.]\nLee Shin Woo barely thought it might be him experiencing Hansen’s memories, and then lost his consciousness then and there. When he opened his eyes, he was... surprisingly in a world overflowing with life.\nThere were flowers and grass growing in the lawn with flies flying in between... there were tables here and there, as well as delicious looking food and drinks. Lee Shin Woo was familiar with this kind of thing. This was a party.\n\"Hansen, are you nodding off again?\"\n\"Mm. No, I wasn’t nodding off at all.\"\n\"What a smooth talker.\"\nHe heard Hansen’s young voice, who he’d fought just a short while ago, as well as a slightly older voice who was rebuking him.\nLee Shin Woo’s consciousness was inside as... Hansen raised his head. A spirited middle age man was there, and for some reason, he felt close.\n\"I’m not lying, Sir Seagald. More importantly, what about the guard in the west?’\n’You’re Seagald!?’\nOf course he felt close! He’d heard so many stories about Seagald! However... Lee Shin Woo felt somewhat strange. Seagald was the head of Anti-Skull, and was well aware that he was hostile towards the Emperor and his subordinates.\nYet, Seagald was approaching Hansen, one of the 12 generals, with such intimacy, so he realized that this must be a time far in the past.\n\"It seems like her majesty, the Princess, didn’t like the party. She went back to the palace immediately. So, henceforth, I will be guarding his majesty, the Prince instead.\"\n\"It’d be nice if I could just return to the palace as well...\"\n\"Don’t nod off until his majesty orders your return.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"\nHansen replied briefly by nodding his head, but then raised his head and asked.\n\"Now that I think about it, the party isn’t that big this time. Did the 1st Princess come to the party today?’\n\"Don’t overstep.\"\n\"Yes, sir. But still, I think I’d be a suitable husband... Hui.\"\nHansen barely avoided the formless energy that came from Seagald. And like Lee Shin Woo always did when he experienced someone’s memories through Bone Reinforcement, he engraved their fight into his memory.\nHe thought they might be weaker, as this was so far in the past, but after watching their recent quarrel, it seemed like both Seagald and Hansen were in their prime.\n\"If I hadn’t avoided this, my face would’ve been split apart. Seriously, why are you only like this to me?\"\n\"You’ve become stronger since you became a general, Hansen. Once you’re done with your escort duty, shall we spar?\"\n\"That sounds good. This is my chance to see my future brother-in-law’s skill... Uaah.\"\nThis time, flames shot up. Lee Shin Woo had learned that Seagald’s flames were different from the norm! On the other hand, Hansen was moving desperately in order to dodge them. From within Hansen, after Lee Shin Woo had felt Hansen’s mana rotating quickly and instantaneously turn into lightning, he nodded his head.\n’As I thought... There was a reason I felt a bit of superfluousness in his movements.’\nThe lightning was indeed powerful, but contrary to Lee Shin Woo, who transformed mana into lightning itself, Hansen would quickly circulate his mana through a special pattern before he transformed it to something that felt like lightning magic, and then used his skill.\nThough it was powerful, it was still inefficient... Originally, Bursting Thunder was a skill that had that same feel, and aside from Lee Shin Woo, who could utilize the elements freely, most people probably used the elements like this.\n\"She’s a saint.\"\n\"Then at least the second princess.\"\nEven while Lee Shin Woo was organizing his thoughts regarding the elements, Seagald and Hansen continued to talk. It seemed as though Seagald’s younger sister, the Princess, was incredibly pretty, as Hansen held on persistently.\n\"She’s still a priest.\"\n\"Our religious order doesn’t forbid marriage!\"\n\"Hoo...\"\nSeagald’s tone seemed to say ’even after all this, he still doesn’t understand’, and he sighed magnificently. Then, he took a look around, and Hansen followed suit; they noticed people were gathering. In the center, there was a luxuriously dressed middle aged man.\n\"Is this some kind of entertainment you’ve prepared for us?\"\n\"No, your majesty. It was just us joking around...\"\n\"I, the Crown Prince, will allow it. Show our guests just how great the swords of the Empire are.\"\n\"Ehk...\"\n\"I understand, your majesty.\"\nIt was an order from the Crown Prince (who he protected); he would have to fight against someone who he couldn’t beat in front of all these people. Hansen was shocked, but on the other end, Seagald had already drawn his sword.\nWhat’s worse, Seagald’s eyes were big and bright, meaning that he was going to discipline him, a manner-less brat, for coveting his younger sisters.\n\"Come at me whenever, Hansen.\"\n\"Please stop glaring at me so strongly. This is a spar, a spar.\"\n\"I know. Though occasionally, real sword spars result in casualties.\"\n\"Are you trying to kill me?!\"\nHowever, there was already no way for Hansen to escape. Once the Crown Prince clapped his hands, men wearing impressive uniforms came running out, clearing the area, and creating a space for the match.\nHansen sported a expression looking as though he was a condemned criminal in an execution ground, and was forced to draw his sword. It as the sword that had become a part of Lee Shin Woo, the Divine Lightning Sword.\n’To think I’d be able to experience a fight between generals. I’ve really hit the jackpot, haven’t I!?’\nHe’d acquired memories regarding a party that had nothing to do with the Empire’s struggles, or even its secrets, so Lee Shin Woo had been grumbling that he would have to stay put and just watch men and women talking the entire time, but he had no idea it would end up like this!\n\"If you’re not attacking, then I will.\"\n\"Hoo...\"\nHe did his very best to focus on the current situation. He’d already killed Hansen, and it felt like he would never have to fight Seagald in the future, but it was quite a big deal that he was able to experience the battle between two big shots so clearly!\n\"If you’re giving me the first move, then I’ll gladly take it!\"\nHansen said while turning his magic into lightning; He then charged at Seagald with a blinding speed. It was the same Lightning Shadow technique he’d used during their fight!\n’Ah, this should be easy.’\nLee Shin Woo definitely had talent in the ways of manipulating mana, so the moment he experienced it firsthand, he figured out the core of the technique.\nThe goal of Lightning Shadow was to eliminate the boundary between the body and magic by rapidly circulating one’s magic and expanding it through the interior of one’s body. Right now, Hansen’s body was akin to a thunderbolt! He was ridiculously strong and fast. To the point that he could face a level 8!\nOf course, not only did it consume an overwhelming amount of magic, but just using the technique would damage one’s body. However, it was an incredible technique that took that into consideration and would momentarily increase one’s power exponentially.\n’You could probably use the skill the same way with another element, but... it seems like the lightning element is most effective. Next would probably be wind.’\nAs expected, the lightning element was powerful. Lee Shin Woo could understand how Hansen had become the Emperor’s hitman, despite being level 7 amongst the generals. And at the same time, there was something he realized...\n’If I become familiar with it here, then my Lightning Sprint might get stronger as well.’\nLightning Sprint was a charge skill that was based on high rank spirit arts. One’s body would be engulfed in lightning and the skill would give its user overwhelming acceleration and destructive force. If Lightning Shadow was like changing the inner gloves, then Lightning Sprint was like changing the outer gloves!\nBut at their core, the techniques were similar, so it didn’t feel like it would be very difficult to learn both at the same time. And if he were to succeed as well, he would be able to use two skills with ridiculous synergy. After he’d created the Shadow Horn skill, he must’ve gotten a taste for fusing skills together, as Lee Shin Woo wanted to study the skills immediately.\nHowever.\n\"Heup!\" The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the Nove1Fire.net\nUsing his skill, Hansen charged forward quickly, and Seagald charged as well, blocking Hansen mid-way. He easily deflected Hansen’s blade and simultaneously kicked his stomach.\nHansen spun his body and tried to respond with a kick of his own, but by then, the back of Seagald’s blade forcefully struck Hansen’s head. Dozens of moves had occurred within the blink of an eye, and ultimately, before the duration of Lightning Shadow ended... Hansen was on his knees.\n\"Kuheok. I lost.\"\n\"Mm.\"\nEven though Lee Shin Woo had been experiencing the battle in Hansen’s body, he still had no idea what had happened and how he had lost so badly. He would need to think back to this battle several times in the future.\n\"That’s the secret technique you invented, right? Mm, it’s certainly powerful and quick. However, your mind couldn’t keep up with your body. That’s why you can’t beat me.\"\n\"Kuheuk, you’re right...\"\nThe party members applauded. Of course, the party members didn’t really know what had happened, but they at least seemed to realize that Seagald had won overwhelmingly. Plus, Hansen had gone all out from the very beginning, yet Seagald hadn’t even drawn his fire sword!\n’As I thought, Seagald’s a swordsman who specializes in fire.’\nWhile Lee Shin Woo nodded at the flowing memories, Seagald slightly laughed and extended his hand towards Hansen.\n\"I can’t give you my little sister, but you have gotten stronger.\"\n\"I’m glad you’re not my enemy, Sir Seagald... Hoo.\"\nHansen grabbed Seagald’s hand, stood up, and spoke. Seagald thought he was exaggerating and grinned.\n\"So long as I serve his Imperial Majesty, that will never happen. I promise you in the name of the house Retadane.\"\n\"I’ll be part of the family soon anyway... Uoooooooh!\"\nSeagald twisted Hansen’s hand and threw him aside. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo’s consciousness became faint. The rich and plentiful experience was finally drawing to a close.\n’No, wait a sec.’\nBut Lee Shin Woo, who was returning after acquiring combat experience and skill know-how, was shocked at something that Seagald had said.\n’Retadane... is that what he said?’\nAt that moment, his consciousness faded. What terrible timing.",

    "content": "<Chapter 26. New Element - 1>\n[The Bursting Thunder skill has become Lv10 and has evolved to the high rank level! Strength and Magic have increased by 30. The powerful lightning can now draw upon the energy of the heavens.]\n[The Intermediate Combat Sense skill has become Lv9. Agility has increased by 10. You will have a foggy idea of what your opponent will do next.]\n[You have learned the active skill, Lv1 Lightning Shadow.]\nHe’d not only learned how to further progress as a warrior who used lightning, but also gained a new skill he could potentially fuse, and had an experience that was especially profitable; yet, Lee Shin Woo stared blankly, as though he had left his soul behind. Jin and Kratia quietly examined Lee Shin Woo.\n\"What could’ve happened for him to be like that?\"\n\"I wonder. Maybe he got a lot less stats than he’d expected from the bone?\"\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo didn’t hear the two’s voices. He couldn’t forget the last thing Seagald had said.\n’Retadane... He definitely said Retadane.’\nThere was no way he’d heard wrong. Moreover, the memory of the experience was still fresh, and he could playback the memory if he wanted.\nHe was sure. Seagald had said ’Retadane’.\n’Wait... Now that I think about it, Retadane would react whenever I talked about Seagald.’\nAt the time, Lee Shin Woo had responded to her as naturally as possible, but he inwardly thought it was strange. Because Retadane didn’t really react when the other 12 generals were mentioned. Thus, he had hypothesized that Retadane had already met Seagald once before...\n’If that’s the case, then is she his descendent...? She’s probably not his daughter, so maybe his granddaughter?’\nWhen he’d come to the Underground Empire, he had definitely heard God say this in passing. Before she had summoned heroes from other worlds, she had turned her world’s people into heroes. They all ’failed’, but she didn’t say that they had all ’died’.\nBut to think a citizen of the Empire would be included... Not only that, but a citizen of the Empire who wasn’t affected by the curse.\n’It’s not impossible, right? She might’ve been born in a dungeon.’\nSo long as she operated as a hero, there would be no problem for him, regardless of whether Seira Von Retadane was a citizen of the Empire, lived above ground, or just lived in this world.\nHe was a bit curious if the other heroes knew about this, but... anyone would be able to figure out the truth if they knew Seagald’s family name, and it wasn’t even really a huge secret either.\n’If I get the chance, I’ll ask Pleine.’\nBut Lee Shin Woo realized that he didn’t really need to go out of his way to ask Pleine. By defeating the Lightning Shadow General, he’d gained 10 permits to God’s secret shop!\nDefeating a general greatly contributed to God’s goal of purifying the Empire, so it seemed as though God gave those contributing heroes the chance to meet her as a reward. If that’s the case, then asking God would give him the most clear answer!\n\"Alright. ’Strike the iron while it’s hot.’\"\n\"What? There’s still more we have to do?\"\n\"Nope. We’re finished. It’s been a while, so let’s go meet God. Why don’t you come too, Kratia?\"\nJin looked uneasy, while Kratia briefly looked like she had no idea what was going on. She ruminated over the message right away, and nodded her head.\n\"Now that I think about it, I remember you (Shin Woo) talking about that.\"\n\"You don’t need to be afraid. All you need to do is badger her for a ability or an item.\"\n\"Alright. ...I’ve changed my mind a little.\"\nKratia still didn’t like the idea of God affecting her abilities, but the conversation changed if God could give her a new artifact. Kratia, who wanted a new ability for her artifact, nodded her head at his words, and ultimately, entered God’s garden.\n\"Then, shall we go too?\"\n\"Do we really have to?\"\n\"You never know, we might get better abilities. Plus, I have something personal I want to ask God. But if you really don’t want to go...\"\n\"...No, I’ll go.\"\nJin sighed quietly, nodded as if he had resolved himself, and stood beside him. Lee Shin Woo had no idea what he had been thinking about, but thought it wasn’t strange that Jin had his own problems to think about, and used the permit to God’s garden.\n[The party is entering God’s garden through the use of the permit.]\nWhen he softly closed his eyes and reopened them, he was transported to a beautiful garden that he’d been to once before.\nPerhaps because he completely accepted himself last time, he didn’t appear as a human, but as a level 6 Powered Elemental Bone Joker. Of course, Jin wasn’t anywhere nearby...\n[Good job!]\n\"Ugh.\"\nHe felt someone touch him. Lee Shin Woo felt an aggressively warm and soft feeling spread over his body and the sweet aroma made it so he momentarily couldn’t get a hold of himself, but was soon able to calm down through Invisible Heart.\nThe situation was quite clear. God was hugging him! To think she could agitate him, an undead; she wasn’t a God for nothing. One who goes beyond the norm; an individual who goes against logic... Lee Shin Woo was unnerved by that aggressive charm.\n\"Please get off me.\"\n[To think you’d beat one of the 12 generals! It’s been so long since that’s happened!]\n\"I said get off me.\"\nGod was still excited and didn’t let go, but soon, Lee Shin Woo forcefully pushed her away. She laughed, patted his back, and stepped back.\n[Try to understand. I like to express my happiness as well.]\n\"...It’s a relief that you feel so happy.\"\nTo be honest, Lee Shin Woo had questioned God’s intent of wanting to purify the Empire before, but seeing her current attitude, he realized that her intent wasn’t a lie after all. He really couldn’t figure her out. Maybe she was just psychotic.\n[You probably can’t understand me, huh?]\n\"Yes.\"\nLee Shin Woo replied honestly. God smiled bitterly, pulled over a chair from a nearby table, and sat down. Then, like last time, she propped her chin on her hands, and spoke calmly.\n[I just... you know, don’t you feel happy when you get a goal despite it being a lost game? You might’ve gotten around twenty goals repeatedly.]\n\"That’s really not something a goddess should say in front of a hero.\"\n[Be happy. I’m only talking about this because it’s you. Since it seems like you’ve already realized quite a few things on your own.]\nGod was weird. And Lee Shin Woo, who was similarly weird, was forced into becoming her comrade through her previous comment. He’d thought it may not be true, but this Empire, no this world had no hope!\n\"Nice of you to bring me to this despair ridden world.\"\n[That’s what I thought at first, but now I think you may become this world’s new hope. Ethan is already beginning to dawdle, but if it’s you...]\n\"Please don’t forcefully put all your hopes on me. I’m just doing as I please.\"\n[So about the reward...]\nGod, who’d completely ignored Lee Shin Woo, gently gazed at Lee Shin Woo and said.\n[You’re not planning on getting another quest again, are you?]\n\"Is there even anything else I can get from you?\"\n[There are still one or two things I can give you.]\nGod replied humbly towards Lee Shin Woo’s snobbish sounding comment. God probably knew more about his latent potential than he did, so she wasn’t lying.\nLee Shin Woo briefly ruminated over it. But because the abilities God granted weren’t inherently hostile, he just nodded his head, especially because he didn’t really want another quest from her. The source of this content ɪs novel✶fire.net\n\"Well, let’s hear it.\"\n[An element.]\nThe conversation turned in a completely different direction. Lee Shin Woo, who had been completely uninterested in what she said before, was somewhat surprised.\n[Even I didn’t think you would be able to use elemental power so naturally. It would normally be impossible to bestow an element onto a hero, but... it should be no problem if I were to bestow one onto you.]\nHis abilities had grown and he was extremely talented, so if God were to give him a small nudge, he could awaken a powerful ability.\nAnd he pretty much understood what God was saying. It didn’t matter if it were fire or lightning; being given a small ’opportunity’ was plenty. God was giving him that opportunity.\n[And if you accept this, it should become much easier for you to fight against Ethan.]\n\"Didn’t you say that he was a good hero?\"\n[He can’t compare to you at this point.]\nLooking at her statement in a different way, she was saying that if Lee Shin Woo hadn’t defeated one of the 12 generals, then even if he had been done in by Ethan Cruz later, she would just pass it off with a laugh.\n\"... You’re cruel. Seriously.\"\n[You’re one to talk.]\nLee Shin Woo thought that beings who had surpassed the limitations of humans were different, but God looked at him and snorted. It was as though she saw him as the same as her.\n[Now, focus.]\n\"Alright.\"\nThe amount of time allotted to them wasn’t very long. Lee Shin Woo softly closed his eyes and God released her energy. Lee Shin Woo immediately felt something enter his body, and it was infinitely dark and somber... It was similar to the curse that lingered in the Empire.\nNo, that wasn’t all. It was quite similar to the curse that he experienced often... what was it? While Lee Shin Woo pondered over the identity of this energy, that energy responded, and Lee Shin Woo lost all feeling in his body.\nHis mana, which possessed no inherent properties, met with the energy as it released, and... it assimilated it, and he could feel a change. And soon, a terse response showed up before him.\n[You have acquired the Lv1 High Rank Element - Darkness. Magic has increased by 100.]\n[Curse Resistance - MAX has transformed into Darkness Resistance - MAX. Magic has increased by 20.]\n[Darkness is one of the great elements that makes up half of this world. It is peaceful, the power of shadows, the opposite of light, and the power of relationships.]\n[But darkness magic makes one forget that they are dead or alive, and can even force them to forget what they are. An imperfect and improper connection results in a twisted appearance... and this causes people to be afraid of it.]\n[You have become aware of this power, which originated from within you, due to outside stimuli, and have successfully grasped it. However, if you use too much power, others may become afraid of you. And ultimately, those natural relationships will break down and become twisted.]\n\"...This is...\"\nLee Shin Woo realized why he felt familiar with this power. The relationships he’d created with others... his partnership with Jin, accepting the Pauls as his subordinates... or even more broadly speaking, using the Command skill or Instigate skill to affect others and manipulate them was all because of the darkness element!\nHowever, at the same time, if what he felt was right, then this power was...\n\"Didn’t the curse come from this element!?\"\n[You’re right. To be exact, it was darkness magic that was used as the foundation. Your Curse Resistance changed into Darkness Resistance, right? You probably could’ve brought about that change.]\nGod acknowledged him and nodded her head, as if she wasn’t spilling a huge secret.\n[You’re probably well aware of this, but while you weren’t consciously aware of this power, you used it bit by bit. I just awakened it and made it so you could actually use it in a proper form...]\n\"...\"\n[So, your existence has become much more shocking. Perhaps your karma is heading in that direction.]\nThough she was a god, could she not peruse his stats? At the very least, she didn’t show any indication of knowing that he was a Joker. Perhaps this was also an effect of the Joker karma.\n[There’s a huge difference in the results of those who use magic. I know that better than anyone else. So, make sure you work hard. ...I hope you don’t become like the Emperor or Ethan.]\n\"...\"\n[Then, get going. I was so happy that I ended up giving you way too much.]\n\"Ah, just one second. I’d like to ask you about Retadane...\"\n[It’s impossible for even I to give you information on other heroes more than is necessary.]\n\"She’s a hero, right? She’s an ally, right?\"\nTo top everything off, Lee Shin Woo asked God about his conclusion, and God just laughed and replied.\n[Of course she is. She’s a trustworthy hero, more than anyone else.]",

    "content": "<Chapter 26. New Element - 2>\n[There’s nothing more for you to gain here. So, don’t come here anymore... and try to gather them.]\nGod said enigmatically, and Lee Shin Woo was chased out of God’s garden. As expected, Jin seemed to have come back before him, as he was waiting with a sour expression (Lee Shin Woo could see past Jin’s Steel Heart armor now and could tell what expression he was making).\n\"Hey Jin.\"\n\"What’s up, Shin Woo.\"\n\"Why do I feel even more confused than before I went to clear things up?\"\n\"You shouldn’t be asking me. I’m dumb, so don’t ask me anything in the future either.\"\n\"It’s nice to see you so confident... Hooo.\"\nBy meeting with God, Lee Shin Woo realized that he was the center of this situation. That’s just how powerful the ability he’d gained was.\n...To be honest, it was really troublesome. He had clearly done his best to roam around the world, as well as figure out the truth, grow step by step, and focus only on ensuring his own safety, but he hadn’t really planned on becoming the protagonist and go wild on the main stage.\n\"After you gain great power, you get caught up in trouble, huh.\"\n\"I feel like I’ve heard that line before...\"\nJin tilted his head and Lee Shin Woo continued to play dumb; and in no time, Kratia returned. Even though she was the first to leave, she was the last to return. ...But there was a reason for that.\n\"Shin Woo, take a look at this.\"\nOnce she found him, she rushed over to Lee Shin Woo, put her palms together, and pushed them forward. There was a tiny ice crystal floating above them... it was the artifact that exponentially increased her strength, the Orb of Eternal Ice.\n\"It got a lot smaller.\"\n\"It’ll eventually get so small that you won’t be able to see it. But that’s not what’s important right now.\"\nShe yelled and tightened her palms together causing the orb to instantly break apart! Lee Shin Woo was shocked, yet Kratia remained calm... Soon, he found that the energy that comprised the orb flowed through her body.\nHer once light purple hair and sky blue eyes turned silver, and were radiating light. Lee Shin Woo could feel the power of that light, as it seemed to push her magic in a certain direction.\n\"Is that Lightning Shadow?\"\n\"No, it’s different from that idiotic technique. Think of my goal as assimilating the Eternal Ice, the high rank magic formula. And the power I gain from doing so is...\"\nHe could tell without listening to her explanation. Since Kratia had invoked her catalytic magic through the Eternal Ice. Lee Shin Woo was well aware that now that she’d assimilated the Eternal Ice, the surrounding mana was quickly being sucked into her and turning into cold air.\nContrary to before, where she used the orb to transform the surrounding mana, gather it, and launch it, she could now finely control her magic. It was all due to concentrating the Eternal Ice’s mana internally.. Therefore, it was like she had gone from Imperialdramon Dragon Mode to Paladin Mode. [1]\n\"To make this, I had to use the artifact you gave me, but it’s ok since its ability is still intact.\"\n\"But if you were going to do this, wouldn’t it have been better to ask to absorb it instead?\"\n\"I’m not you...\"\n\"Ah, that’s right. My bad...\"\nShe talked about how amazing this technique was, and how much stress it put on her body; she made sure to emphasize a few times how a human’s body was unable to handle catalytic magic, so she used this inconvenient method of storing the orb’s power into her body, and that he wouldn’t be able to understand her. And she added just one more thing.\n\"You should be able to turn yourself into a catalyst without this.\"\n\"I told you I can’t.\"\n\"Watch and learn!\"\n\"You know it’s not something I can just ’watch and learn’!\"\nNo matter how he thought it, Kratia’s expectations of him were way too high. Kratia released her catalyst mode, and pestered him a bit; after that, Lee Shin Woo sighed (though nothing came out) and stood up.\nThen, he watched over to the Lv7 (Elite) Chimera Avenger that had... just been watching him until now.\n[What will you do now? Are you going to go look for another general?]\n\"No. We were only able to defeat him because of our information, and our adaptation of the situation. But things won’t go this smoothly next time, so now we have to thoroughly prepare and gather our strength.\"\n[Gather our strength...! How right you are. Then how should we do that?]\nThe other Chi Pauls heard him and their eyes gleamed. It seemed as though they were still misunderstanding something, so Lee Shin Woo decided to be honest with them.\n\"You guys will move separately from me. You need to become stronger your own way, and I have to get stronger my own way as well. Of course we’re not going our separate ways forever.\"\n[How can that be... We weren’t going to continue to travel with you?]\n[That’s... I don’t feel that we can burn with hatred and revenge without you there to guide us.]\nLee Shin Woo smiled bitterly at their response. Of course, they were a powerful force. They were a group of level 6 elites with even a level 7 elite as well, so if he were to travel with them, he wouldn’t die in most situations.\n...However, objectively speaking, neither side would be able to properly grow. It would almost be like a restriction on them. It would be restricting to both Lee Shin Woo and the Chi Pauls.\n\"I don’t plan on controlling you through your hatred alone. For now, go where your feet take you. Watch the current world with your own two eyes... there should be something you get from it. It’s fine if it’s hatred or a completely different emotion. In the end, you’ll be able to get even stronger.\"\n[The current world...]\nRather than bring them along with him, it’d be better to release them onto the world’s stage. Moreover, he could just bring them when he really needed them. They’ll eventually fight together, even if he didn’t want to.\nSo, for him, as well as for the purpose of purifying the Empire and their own growth, it would be best to go their separate ways.\n[We still don’t really understand. It’s much too vague.]\n\"Ah, before you go, there’s something I need to show you. It might even encourage you.\"\n[A place you need to show us?]\n[Something that will... encourage us?]\n\"Yeah.\"\nLee Shin Woo looked at the Chi Pauls... his completely destroyed surroundings, Kratia, who was blankly staring at him, Jin, as well as the collapsed satellite city, Kadinan.\nHe smiled bitterly. His original plan had been so much simpler, so how did things turn out like this?\n\"Now, shall we go and see what’s hidden within the secret facilities?\"\n\"Are you going to show me too?\"\n\"What’s with you all of a sudden?\"\nKratia became a bit happy at Lee Shin Woo’s words. To be honest, he thought it would turn out like this when he had first asked her for help, but it wasn’t a bad feeling to be recognized by one’s information sharing partner.\n\"Hey, he’s a skeleton.\" The most update n0vels are published on Novᴇl_Fire(.)net\n\"I know. He’s a skeleton who’s really good at handling magic.\"\nJin commented from beside her, but Kratia tilted her head as if to say ’and what about it?’. Lee Shin Woo heard their chat, but he had no idea what they were even talking about.\n\"So you got a request from the golems?\"\n\"Yeah. We’ve been in contact even before then.\"\n[Are you saying that there are knights who succeeded the experiment...?]\nLee Shin Woo led the party, entered the facility, and explained the events to Kratia. It was also an explanation to the Chi Pauls, who were turned into golems and sacrificed for the experiment.\n\"The Golden General, Arema Steelworker...\"\n\"The reason I didn’t tell you earlier was because I was concerned that you might go looking for him. Plus, it would’ve become a pain for us, as we need to use the golem trains.\"\n\"...I understand.\"\nKratia agreed; if it were her from a few months back that was extremely curious about how golems worked, she might’ve stuck with Lee Shin Woo and been a pain in the ass. Of course, she was different now. She knew when she could be greedy and when she needed to resign herself.\n\"If they figured out who I am, they would be suspicious.\"\n\"Assuming that they know about every single hero in the Empire, there’s no reason to link us with the heroes. As you know, we don’t look like heroes, right?\"\n\"Yeah. So long as we don’t know their intent, there’s no reason to tell them about the heroes.\"\nWhile conversing, they explored every nook and cranny of the facility. The Chi Pauls heard Lee Shin Woo talk about ’other golems’, as well as finding traces of other knights being sacrificed as test subjects just like them and began to feel a powerful emotion that they couldn’t define.\n[The test succeeded, but they were indeed sacrificed. To think that there’s a core capable of making someone absolutely loyal.]\n[Yet, that core is what allowed us to be reborn. Though there’s no trace of it anymore.]\n[Do you think they’re hostile to the Emperor as well?]\n[They’re probably not like us. Moreover, Arema Steelworker? I remembered when I heard his name. It seemed like he wanted to hide it, but... we saw it.]\nOne Chi Paul spoke in the middle of the other Chi Pauls. It seemed as though its intellect was far greater than the other Chi Pauls, probably as much as the level 7... it compared the memories of countless knights’ imperfect memories and extracted them, coming into possession of a massive amount of intact memories.\n[Isn’t it him? The one who recommended this damn plan to the Emperor?]\n[Is that true?]\n\"...What did you say!?\"\nThat’s the first even Lee Shin Woo had heard of it! He immediately turned his head, and the Chi Paul stepped back slightly, as if flustered, and bowed his head.\n[I’m sure. I couldn’t be sure before, due to the fragmented memories, but... I can tell now. The one who recommended that the Emperor turn knights into golems was... No, the one who first introduced the technique of making golems came from him.]\n\"...Is that so?\"\nArema Steelworker was definitely the one who proposed the experiment, but he’d never told Lee Shin Woo who had come up with the plan. Moreover, at the time of the experiment, he had volunteered himself and pledged his loyalty to the Emperor, so he hadn’t lied.\n’The truth was merely hidden; it wasn’t a lie. Even so, it’s still deception.’\nLee Shin Woo’s mouth gaped, as though his jawbone would fall out, but he was smiling. That’s because he’d gotten a hint from a place he’d never expected to get one from.\n’He sent me here himself, but to think I’d hear about this from the knights who were supposed to be buried in the past... Moreover, he probably didn’t think that there was a way to gather all the knights’ fragmented memories and rebuild them.’\nOf course he wouldn’t know. Lee Shin Woo hadn’t known either!\n\"Even so, was there anything that changed? They just went from loyal psychos to people who got a hold of themselves and ran away following the Emperor’s activation of the curse, no?\"\n\"Well, that could be it. But if Arema Steelworker was the one to recommend the formation of the golem army, then...\"\nLee Shin Woo was remembering. All the golems possessed a mark that allowed the Emperor to control them, and under that, Guillotine Steelworker and the others held a high rank administrative mark. Then under that was a general administrator’s mark.\n\"But from what I remember, Arema Steelworker possessed a mark for just himself... one that wasn’t the Emperor’s mark, or even the Steelworker mark.\"\nOf course, he probably needed it to control the golem army. Rather than the Emperor giving orders, it would be much better for the general, Arema Steelworker to be commanding the troops in battle.\nHowever, if he was the one who started everything... and if he had a different intention in mind...\n\"What if Arema Steelworker’s mark is even higher than the Emperor’s?\"\n\"...\"\nHis sharp statement caused everyone to keep their mouths shut. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo, who had been feeling up the wall, stopped his hand. At his fingertips, the Steelworker mark was radiating a blinding light.\nHe’d finally found the facility within the facility; the entrance to the secret area.\n[1] T/N: Digimon reference.

    "content": "<Chapter 26. New Element - 3>\nA dark secret and a buried testing facility. Within that facility was another hidden area. It was an area that could only be opened with the Steelworker seal, not the general administrator seal. ...Wait a sec, Steelworker?\n\"Ha.\"\nThe Steelworker seal was revealed, and while he was studying the lock, he discovered some information; Lee Shin Woo grinned because he didn’t think his hypothesis would be confirmed immediately.\n\"Only a Steelworker can enter.\"\n\"The Emperor can’t go in?\"\n\"Yep. It’s not just Arema Steelworker who can access it; Guillotine Steelworker and the other level 7 golems can get inside as well. Aside from them, there’s no one who has permission to enter. Which means that the Emperor can’t go in.\"\n\"How did you figure that out by just looking at it... Nope, never mind. Don’t look at me like that.\"\nJin looked quizzical and was about to ask further, but thought better of it. He kicked Lee Shin Woo’s eye sockets with his forelegs, as Lee Shin Woo had turned around to look at him. Lee Shin Woo hastily evaded his kick and continued with his explanation.\n\"If I hadn’t heard what the Chi Pauls had said before, I might’ve just thought that this place was for ’staff only’. But after hearing what they had to say, and seeing another hidden installation...\"\n[Are you saying that Arema Steelworker, as well as those who hold the Steelworker name had a different secret plan? So... a plan that he started not out of loyalty for the Emperor?]\n\"Mm, it probably wasn’t a pure motive.\"\n[How can that be...?]\nOnce they heard Lee Shin Woo’s conclusion, the Chi Pauls were infuriated. Of course, they didn’t have even a shred of loyalty towards the Emperor anymore. However, when they thought about the fact their pure feelings had been used, they felt an unrestrained rage!\nHowever, these infuriated Chi Pauls focused on Lee Shin Woo’s calm voice.\n\"Calm down. You can’t do anything with just anger.\"\n[However...!]\n\"Arema Steelworker is a powerful level 8. He has a few level 7 elite subordinates around him, and he has several level 6 golems under his command. I’m saying that he’s not an opponent you can overcome with just your powerful emotions.\"\nHis rational and cool-headed statement caused the Chi Pauls to be silent. Lee Shin Woo placed a hand on one of the Chi Pauls and softly laughed. He didn’t speak to just one Chi Paul, but spoke loud enough so that all the others could hear him.\n\"Don’t let your emotions just burn; use them as fuel and temper them. There are countless ways for you to get stronger in this world, and if you work at it, it’s not impossible for you to surpass Arema Steelworker. Do you want to be controlled by your emotions and be a tiger moth, or do you want to take control over your emotions and become a phoenix? That’s up to you.\"\n[...]\nThe Chi Paul, no all the Chi Pauls must’ve felt something from Lee Shin Woo’s speech, as they nodded their heads in silence. Lee Shin Woo smiled faintly, and Jin hit his back.\n’Shin Woo, you’re so sickening that I feel like I’m going to throw up.’\n’Speaking earnestly works on these types of guys. Look, their eyes are sparkling.’\n’You’re really scary...’\nLee Shin Woo, who had silenced Jin with a short reply, confirmed that the Chi Pauls had calmed down, and returned to the main topic.\n\"The existence of a secret facility that only a Steelworker can access, and the Emperor who ordered the undead to watch this entire area... This has made it clear. The Emperor knew that something was hidden here. And he must’ve known that this was what Steelworker was aiming for.\" Thıs content belongs to NoveI-Fire.ɴet\n\"And Arema Steelworker is...\"\n\"He knows what the Emperor is doing. That’s why he wanted us to attack from the front. After I had diverted the Emperor’s attention and had taken care of the vestiges of the testing facility... he must’ve been planning on coming here quietly later.\"\n[Either side is... ridiculous...!]\nThe Chi Paul was right. You could only look down on people so much. Of course, it was a relief that Lee Shin Woo wasn’t someone who took things lying down, but... Lee Shin Woo’s expression was actually relaxed. There was no shaking in his goblin fire.\n\"If I completely clear this place and return unscathed, then they won’t be able to look down on me anymore. That’s when it’ll start in earnest. Will they perceive me as a threat and try to take me out, or... will they try to use me?\"\nLee Shin Woo thought it would be the latter. Like they had said, their enemies were the same; that’s the only thing he was sure about. And to be honest, that wasn’t really a bad thing for Lee Shin Woo. Why...?\n\"If I know what they’re thinking to a degree, then it shouldn’t be difficult to get them onto my stage.\"\nHe finished speaking and simultaneously, the Steelworker mark above his hand radiated light. It looked a bit different from when he had first used it, but he had been continuously studying the mark. This was the result of his improvements and calculations.\nIt possessed some additional function as well, but... the most prioritized additional function was ’secrecy’. Lee Shin Woo was concerned that the information would get back to Arema Steelworker, so he had added this function in; it was an additional function he had created so that wherever he was, or whatever he was doing wouldn’t be reported. It was a fundamentally high level and shocking security feature.\n[Opening the facility. Welcome, Steelworker.]\nThey wouldn’t know right away that Lee Shin Woo had even entered the facility. Of course, even if they came to find him themselves, they would have no way of knowing that Lee Shin Woo had entered the facility!\n\"Uwah.\"\n\"Waaaaah.\"\nJin and Kratia simultaneously exclaimed. It was only natural as the lock was released, revealing a secret passageway.\nContrary to the outside, where the passage of time was readily apparent, as it was corroded everywhere and had accumulated dust, the passageway was ridiculously clean and refined.\nThere was no rust anywhere. Rocks which radiated light by themselves were embedded everywhere and illuminated the passageway. There was no way of knowing how they had made such a thing.\n\"For now, let’s take these with us since they seem expensive.\"\n\"You’re terrible!\"\nThere wasn’t a use for them really, but they looked expensive, so he decided to extract them. He’d benefited off of collecting all of the wine from the winery before, so Lee Shin Woo thought he might be able to profit again.\n\"Why don’t you take some too?\"\n\"It seems like it’d be useful for when I want to read a book in the dark, so I’ll just take one.\"\n\"That’ll make your eyes go bad, so don’t do it too much.\"\nLee Shin Woo ordered the Chi Pauls to collect all the rocks. He told them to bring one over to him, and when he looked it over, he found that it was made of sunlight stone. It possessed the energy of the sun, and would emit a light equivalent to the rays of the sun; it was an incredibly rare ore.\nHe checked the information and thought that perhaps the light that shined on the Empire came from here. No, when he thought about it, the magical device set up in the vineyard the Dryads were staying at was seemingly made of the same ore.\n\"But there was only one of them there, so what were these golems indulging...\"\n\"As I thought, they seem like a separate group.\"\n\"Hey, on your hand.\"\n\"Ah, aaah.\"\nLee Shin Woo was speechless and Kratia suddenly looked at the Steelworkers as enemies; at that moment, Jin suddenly called out to Lee Shin Woo. When he checked why he was calling him... the sunlight stone made a frightening sound and began transforming.\n[Through Bone Reinforcement, the sunlight stone is transforming! You have acquired the Solar Fossil!]\n\"I told you, fossils aren’t bones... Ah, whatever.\"\nBefore the change, the sunlight stone looked like a rock that emitted light, but once it had finished changing into a solar fossil, it turned into a gray color and emitted powerful light and heat from within. Its properties had definitely been reinforced.\nUnfortunately, the diffusion of light decreased, so he could no longer use it as a light source, but Lee Shin Woo didn’t really care about any of that.\n\"...I’m going to trying absorbing it.\"\nLee Shin Woo tried to absorb one of them. Then, surprisingly, his magic increased by 1, and his fire element proficiency increased by a little! At that moment, his eyes became serious. He thought that these stones might be more important than whatever was hidden within the facility.\n\"Bring all of those to me.\"\n[I understand!]\nBesides the one sunlight stone that Kratia wanted, Lee Shin Woo changed all of the other sunlight stones through Bone Reinforcement. He had obtained a total of 223 Solar Fossils!\nIf he could, he would absorb all of them right here, but it seemed as though it wasn’t such a simple matter; so he would set some time later and patiently study them.\n[...]\n\"Ah, that’s right. I’ll give you one too.\"\n[Thank you!]\nLee Shin Woo, who had finished changing the sunlight stones into solar fossils, called over a Chi Paul and allowed him to absorb it. He had only given them one as he didn’t want to be the one who hoarded all of them, but it had a surprising effect.\n[How can this be... Look at this, Sir Paul Zero.]\n\"Ooooooh!?\"\nFlame burst forth from the Chi Paul’s hand, which emitted an intense heat. The Solar Fossil allowed him to control fire!\nOf course, Bone Reinforcement was a cheat skill that allowed one to absorb a bone’s abilities, but even so, absorbing one of those bones and gaining the ability to wield fire was plenty amazing. Perhaps this was only possible because it was a Chimera?\n[Uooooooooh, fire is coming out of my hand!]\n[Keuk, Kukeuk... The Black Flame Dragon sealed within my right arm is finally...!] [1]\nThe excited Lee Shin Woo finally made the other Chi Pauls absorb a single Solar Fossil each, although only a third of the Chi Pauls awakened an intermediate level of fire.\nIt was obviously impossible for them to handle it so naturally like Lee Shin Woo, but despite that, they were still at the level of an intermediate monster who could manipulate fire. The Chi Paul force’s power had been upgraded instantly.\n[Thank you, Sir Paul Zero!]\n[To think that you could bestow a new power upon us so simply...!]\nThe Chi Pauls had gone beyond admiration or loyalty and looked to be in awe of Lee Shin Woo now. He had just been lucky!\nKratia and Jin, who had both been watching the process from the side, thought that Lee Shin Woo looked like some sort of pseudo religious sect leader, but they didn’t actually say it out loud. If they argued about what was right or wrong, it felt like the Chi Pauls would start to stare at them unkindly.\n\"We’ve arrived.\"\n\"Are there no more sunlight stones?\"\n\"Ah, there’s a really big one over there.\"\n\"Remember to extract it before we leave.\"\n[I understand.]\nAt their unexpected increase in power, all the Chi Pauls were excited, and at that moment, they arrived at their destination. The sunlight stone embedded into the high ceiling illuminated every area of the facility. There was a bookshelf on the surface of one of the walls filled with materials. He assumed that this was both the laboratory and the conference room.\n\"These materials... They’re all related to golems!\"\nLee Shin Woo was sure he’d hit the jackpot. The more Lee Shin Woo surveyed these lottery ticket... no, lotto... no, these Powerball! materials, the more excited he got.\nHe looked over the materials detailing a golem’s inner structure, and an anatomical chart that detailed the part that connected the golem’s body to a core, and felt his excitement reach its peak. His goblin fire blazed so much that it threatened to engulf his skull!\n\"...With these, I should be able to make my own golems, right?\"\n\"Oh, really...?\"\n\"...Oh, holy crap.\"\nJin was freaked out by Lee Shin Woo’s muttering. But Kratia, who had just as much interest in golems as Lee Shin Woo, managed to find another area while he was looking over the materials. She called for Lee Shin Woo, though her voice was quivering.\n\"Look here, Shin... Ah, I mean Paul Zero.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nLee Shin Woo placed the entire bookshelf into his inventory and turned around. It seemed like there was another small passageway in the corner of the facility, and when they followed that path...\n\"How many of these... are there?\"\n\"...\"\nThe moment he discovered it, Lee Shin Woo thoughtlessly clenched his fists. The sunlight stones are more profitable than the contents of the facility? What a joke.\nThere was a laboratory there, with countless rows of gleaming silver cores.\n[1] T/N: I’m pretty sure this is another reference to \"Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions\". I think this refers to the main character’s \"chunibyo\" persona, the Dark Flame Master. Don’t ask me how a golem knows what that is.\nE/N: They don’t have to reference a show to be a chunni.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 26 part4",
    "content": "<Chapter 26. New Element - 4>\n[Original Core]\n[A power source capable of producing Lv6 golems]\nThere were of 277 cores lying around. Lee Shin Woo and Kratia were mesmerized by the cores, and just watched them silently.\nThe Original Core. They were definitely the original form of the Original Bone Core. Lee Shin Woo had barely gotten one or two of them by destroying all of the low ranked golems in an area, yet there were so many gathered here.\n\"If...\"\nLee Shin Woo spoke automatically.\n\"If there were this many cores gathered here, it makes sense that they’d want them back.\"\n\"This many cores would interest not only Arema Steelworker, but the Emperor as well.\"\n\"That’s probably why he kept a general on standby.\"\nThough that general was now dead. He didn’t know when the Emperor would get news of that, but he didn’t need to worry about that right now.\n\"You get stronger if you absorb these, right?\"\n\"No. When you absorb bones with the same power, the effectiveness drops. Now I can’t really get anything out of them. So, with these...\"\n\"You’re going to try making golems?\"\nKratia was quick on the uptake. Her eyes glittered with curiosity. That was what Lee Shin Woo was looking for; no matter how talented he was at magic, it was still just talent. Because he wasn’t knowledgeable in magic theory, he knew that he would need someone else’s help if he really decided to make a golem.\nTo be honest, he could’ve taken down the general by himself if he did well; the reason he had asked for her help was because he knew something like this would happen once he discovered the facility that Arema Steelworker tried to hide.\n\"It’d be hard to make them right now, so let’s move the equipment for now.\"\n\"Let’s say that you can move them because you have an inventory, but do you have the space to store them?\"\n\"Of course I do.\"\nLee Shin Woo grinned and spoke while Kratia just tilted her head. He let her be, and deliberated on what he should do with the Original Cores. The main point of deliberation was whether he should just store the Original Cores or change them into Bone Cores first.\n\"It would probably be ok to change them. Since all of the materials for making golems will be changed through that ability of yours.\"\n\"Giving the materials a sense of unity... Hmm, you’re right. It doesn’t sound like a bad idea.\"\nKratia’s recommendation was decent. Of course, Bone Reinforcement wouldn’t always upgrade the material, but the cores were one of the few exceptions, as the quantity of magic within wouldn’t change with the transformation.\nIt wasn’t like he couldn’t use them as cores once they transformed into Bone Cores; also, there wouldn’t be a loss from transforming them, so there was enough value in doing so. Lee Shin Woo changed all of the cores in one go and stored them into his inventory. Because his inventory had expanded significantly following his level up, there was a lot of free space.\n\"Now, shall we start storing them?\"\n\"Alright. I’ll take the left side.\" Thıs content belongs to novęlfire.net\n\"Then I’ll go over there.\"\nThe party collected the cores, turned around, and removed and collected the equipment as well. To be honest, there were some amongst them that shouldn’t have been thoughtlessly removed, but Lee Shin Woo and Kratia, who had a good grasp of magic, skillfully separated them, meticulously inspected them, and collected them so that there wouldn’t be any trouble.\nOnly five minutes had passed, yet nothing valuable had remained within the facility.\n\"The golems will probably get mad if they see these later, right?\"\n\"It’s alright. They won’t see it.\"\nLee Shin Woo said, and ordered the Chimeras to collect the large sunlight stone. Because the sunlight stone was so large, the transformation was an incredibly unusual sight. Once he placed it into his inventory, the facility immediately became dark. The only words that would come out of his mouth were ’oh, come on’.\n\"You guys go first.\"\n\"Shin Woo?\"\n\"I need to install a bomb before I go.\"\n\"...Are you serious?\"\nThey hadn’t noticed the six Drake Horn Lances floating in the air from behind Lee Shin Woo. No, when they thought about it, there were three or four of them floating behind them when they first entered... Jin recollected that and realized that that’s when Lee Shin Woo had decided to blow up the facility.\n\"You can make it so they don’t know it was us?\"\n\"There’ll probably be no traces left.\"\nLee Shin Woo laughed briefly and sent the rest of the party away. Then, whenever a Drake Horn Lance was fully charged, he would burrow it here and there.\nBecause he’d already demolished much of the equipment that protected the facility, so long as he calculated the location and installed them properly, the six Drake Horn Lances should be able to completely destroy the place.\n\"Nice. This is perfect.\"\nHowever, while Lee Shin Woo was finishing with the bomb installation and leaving the passageway, he felt his chest vibrate. It was the communication line that Kadinan’s lord had possessed that enabled him to communicate with Hansen.\nHansen was already dead, so who was it? He didn’t plan on asking something so boorish. Who could it be? It was obviously either the Emperor, or one of the Emperor’s men.\nLee Shin Woo grinned and raised the communication line. He inputted the bothersome mana seal, and accepted the call. It was then, he’d left the facility, closed the door, and turned around.\n[Kadinan’s lord, Nellopa. Did the Lightning Shadow General return?]\nHe could feel the military discipline within the extremely stiff voice. As expected, it seemed like the Lightning Shadow General had someone supervising him, even though he worked alone. Also, considering the fact that he didn’t add an honorific to his name, it was possible that he was talking to someone really high up. And if that’s the case, there was a high chance that this person was one of the 12 generals as well.\nObviously, showing this guy his identity, even a little bit, wasn’t a good idea. He activated Acting and Disguise simultaneously. It happened in the blink of an eye.\n\"The Lightning Shadow General is...\"\nNellopa’s voice naturally flowed out of Lee Shin Woo’s mouth, and he heard the other whisper, ’so he was just late’. The sound of his small sigh had to be a sign of relief. He decided to break that apart.\n\"The Lightning Shadow General... passed away.\"\n[What!?]\nLee Shin Woo reported, sounding as though he were stifling his tears, and quickly turned the situation around. The other individual raised his voice immediately.\n[Who dares!? How!? A golem!? Was it a golem!?]\n\"Kuheuk, that’s correct. Arema Steelworker...\"\n[We expected the four commanders, but to think Arema Steelworker would act in person. Is he starting an all-out war...!? But it’s too early. How can he be so confident!? Moreover, how did he conceal his energy and move so secretly!?]\nThat’s right. Arema Steelworker was probably too scared to act in person, as he didn’t want to be seen. That’s why he had sent someone from the outside, like Lee Shin Woo, despite it being an important mission to collect more than 200 cores!\nLee Shin Woo, who knew that it wouldn’t be easy for them to believe it, gave them something to convince them.\n\"They’re... on the same side of these guys called Anti-Skull! Kuahk!\"\n[Anti-Skull!? Seagald...! Tell me in more detail! ...No, is there someone else there?]\n\"They’re listening in on us! You have to close the connection... Kuaaaaaaahk!\"\nHe said, and forcefully broke the communication line. Plus, the six Drake Horn Lances exploded early, making it so that the sounds of the explosions were transferred through the communication line.\nWith this, they would think that, ’the enemy was watching Nellopa, and after communicating for a bit, he resisted at the very last moment. He was hit by one of the enemy’s powerful attacks, lost his life, and the communication line was destroyed.’\n\"Nice.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s acting skill had improved rapidly. He then walked away from the collapsed facility and laughed. Even from his own point of view, his acting was pretty good. Now they couldn’t be unaware of Steelworker or Anti-Skull anymore.\n\"Now that I’ve finished everything up, let’s go.\"\n\"You...\"\nHowever, when the party, who were just watching Lee Shin Woo, were about to leave, Jin retorted.\n\"Why did you drag Anti-Skull into this all of a sudden!?\"\n\"Hmm? Their headquarters is way too hard to find, so I thought I could use the Emperor’s side to draw them out. Plus, it would make me sound more credible.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Of course, I want the Steelworkers to expose what they’re planning as they come outside and act, so I involved Anti-Skull... Why are you looking at me like that?\"\n\"I won’t be mad, so tell me honestly... You’re a demon, right?\"\nLee Shin Woo wanted to pass it off as a joke and laugh, but Jin’s burning goblin fire looked extremely honest. He ended up getting slightly hurt.\n[What an amazing act!]\n[As expected of Sir Paul Zero!]\nThough the Chi Pauls revered Lee Shin Woo, they were likewise shocked. No, he’d just done something anyone could do, so why were they...!?\nLee Shin Woo looked at Kratia as his last hope. As expected, Kratia didn’t betray his trust and gave him a thumbs up.\n\"Nice explosion. So much so that I want to recreate it with magic.\"\n\"Ah, is that so?\"\nWhen he looked back, because of the huge explosion inside, the entire area had caved in. It seemed like the fissure would affect them soon, so they prioritized evading that area first. He decided to part ways with the Chi Pauls there.\n[I’ll get stronger no matter what!]\n[I’ll collect a lot of bones! Call me whenever you need me!]\n[I’m sure that if we’re with you, Sir Paul Zero, that we can kill the Emperor and Arema Steelworker. I will only follow you from now on!]\nIt seemed like his acting had left a huge impression on them, and their attitude towards Lee Shin Woo suddenly changed to that of military discipline.\nLee Shin Woo ruminated over whether he should be happy or sad about that... In any case, he had formed a subordinate relationship with them, so he decided to just accept reality.\n\"Go well, Chi Pauls! Get stronger, so much so that you can take on a general!\"\nThe Chi Pauls gathered in one place and quickly sprinted off. Lee Shin Woo waved his hand at them as they began vanishing into the distance. Then, Kratia quietly asked Lee Shin Woo a question.\n\"Shin Woo, how many of these guys have you been ’catching and releasing’?\"\n\"You won’t believe me even if I told you.\"\n\"I’m confident that I’d believe you, even if you said you were the hidden 13th general.\"\n\"Whenever you talk with a hero, you just say whatever you want.\nThey exchanged jokes as they moved towards the golem production facility, or in other words, the golem train that led to Arema Steelworker’s headquarters. Of course, it didn’t take very long for them, and when they reached the top of the hill, they suddenly realized exactly what they had done.\nKadinan was wiped out, and the secret facility had blown up and collapsed... there was no way anyone would be able to tell what had happened by just looking at it!\n\"Then, I just have to go here and wait?\"\n\"Yeah. You shouldn’t take very long, right?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nThey temporarily parted ways with Kratia. She, who was a level 7 and possessed the ability to teleport, checked the designated location and nodded her head.\nIf need be, Lee Shin Woo would test out the Bone Gate he had received, but she left without saying a word, so he felt a bit disappointed.\n\"Then let’s get going too.\"\n\"But Shin Woo, if they’ve already figured out what we’ve done and try to kill us, then...!\"\n\"Then we can just die a few times and then get out. Don’t worry so much.\"\nJin was afraid of Lee Shin Woo’s bold plan, as he was marching over to Arema Steelworker’s headquarters just to flip him off, but in terms of their results, the golems weren’t yet aware of what they had done.\n...No, rather than be aware of what they had done, they actually greeted them affectionately.\n[Did you put them all to rest?]\n\"...Hmm. I just wanted to let you know how disappointed I am in you guys. If we made a mistake, we would’ve had to fight against a general.\"\n[As expected, they... Ahem. We just wanted to know if we could work well together in the future. Listen, you already knew, right?]\n\"Ha. So with this, you’ve realized that ’I’m’ no pushover, right?\"\n[Of course. We know now that ’you guys’ are skilled enough to fight alongside us.]\nI wonder. It seems like you don’t really know yet... Lee Shin Woo inwardly mocked Guillotine. Then, Guillotine unexpectedly extended a fist. Is he asking for a fist bump? Without even realizing, Lee Shin Woo extended his own fist, but then, Guillotine opened his hand, revealing the contents within.\n\"This is...!\"\n[This is the reward we promised. Treat it well. Since it’s something that we poured all of our technical skill into making.]\nGuillotine said, and Lee Shin Woo automatically nodded his head. He opened his own hand. Above Guillotine’s hand lay a... golem that resembled a small bird.\n[Lv6 Observer Golem]\nThis quest was now complete.",

    "content": "<Chapter 27. New Golem Maker - 1>\nOnce Lee Shin Woo and Jin had parted ways with Guillotine, they wordlessly took the golem train and returned to the level 2 danger zone. The facility was close to the area where the past city, Kehebe had been.\nBut there was something cheerfully chatting by their side while they were being silent...\n[Please take care me, Sir Lee Shin Woo. Henceforth, I am in charge of supporting you in battle and scouting. Please give me a name.]\n[Please give me a name. I will explain my abilities again. I possess high agility and strength, but my health is incredibly low, so please handle me with care. I have some magic as well.]\n[Please give me a name. My most effective ability is the subspace. With the latest techniques that were created through high rank magic engineering, I can hold a maximum of 4,000 zeta...]\nLee Shin Woo finally raised his head. He had almost arrived at his destination... the Kerr Century Winery. Before then, he needed to fix this guy.\n\"Is it a relief that they’re misunderstanding us?\"\n\"Misunderstanding?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nThey held the unyielding belief that the Steelworker seal could only be obtained by a Steelworker. That pride. That was Guillotine’s sole mistake, and also his worst. Because of that, Lee Shin Woo was able to clear out the entire facility without garnering any suspicion, and even now...\n\"I’ll give you name, so come over here.\"\n[I underst...]\nLee Shin Woo’s hand came closer and tightly grabbed onto the Observer Golem. He could tell that this guy was sent to spy on him, even without seeing its name.\nBut he didn’t know who exactly ordered it to spy on him, or whether he should either extract information from it, dispose of it, or try to find some other use for it; to find that out, he had been observing it, so he hadn’t acted immediately.\n’If this guy’s orders could only be changed through the use of Arema Steelworker’s seal, then I would’ve had to give up and just dispose of it.’\nHowever, that wasn’t the case. This guy’s maker, as well as administrator were Guillotine. Maybe Arema Steelworker trusts Guillotine a lot?\nHe couldn’t say that this entire quest was due to Guillotine’s decision, but Lee Shin Woo was sure that Guillotine possessed quite a bit of authority. And...\n’If it’s at this level, then I can change it as much as I want with my own authority.’\nLee Shin Woo no longer had a pure Steelworker seal. After countless improvements, he had successfully acquired an independent authority, and it was simple for him to erase Guillotine’s order as if it weren’t there and add in his own.\n’And here...’\nHe hadn’t had the Observer Golem for very long, but right now, he had plenty of time to experiment. Lee Shin Woo made that decision, activated his administrator seal whilst simultaneously infusing in a completely different mana.\n[N...Name...]\nThat radiating, gentle gray energy was none other than his high rank darkness element! Because darkness was the element that controlled contracts, he thought that he would be able to ignore the preexisting command authority and create a new relationship with it; that’s why he had tried it, but the effect was truly outstanding.\n[...Recognizing highest command authority.] Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on N0v3l.Fiɾe.net\nWhen the administrator seal accepted the darkness element and radiated an even more intense light, a black light spread throughout the Observer Golem’s body. It sounded like it was breaking, and at that moment, something seemingly burst out of a part of its body. Then, it spoke in a much more calm voice than before.\n[Pausing record. Deactivating surveillance function. Deactivating information transmission function.]\n\"Information transmission... So when were you going to send a report to Guillotine Steelworker?\"\n[In a week.]\n\"I’d like to make up a report so that they don’t get suspicious, but can you input that kind of information?\n[Of course.]\nMore energy surged from Lee Shin Woo’s hand and permeated the golem. The golem only processed the information that would be ok for Steelworker to see and which could be transmitted to him, and obviously, it was incredibly difficult work, but... Fortunately, Lee Shin Woo had a book he could reference!\n\"Let’s see... Wait just a second, Jin.\"\n\"...\"\nIn one hand, he carried an opened, worn-out book, and in the other, he held the small golem. Lee Shin Woo, who was constantly emitting black energy, looked like he was from some kind of evil cult at best.\nAs always, Jin didn’t really know what Lee Shin Woo was doing, but he decided to do as he was told and watch his surroundings. Lee Shin Woo closed the book after several minutes.\n\"Alright. I can... Mm, is this much ok?\"\n[Any deficient areas can be fixed at a later time.]\n\"Nice. I’ll make some more adjustments after I’ve studied some more and when the time is right.]\n[I understand.]\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo didn’t let go of the golem. He thought that at this rate, when or if Arema Steelworker intervenes, his authority could get taken away. And the only way to create a firm relationship which cannot be disturbed by anyone is...!\n\"Let’s change the programming a bit, shall we? I’ll program it with the absolute concept that ’ownership’ is higher than ’command authority.’\"\n[...It’s possible. In order to prevent a few minor bugs from doing so, I will prioritize removing Steelworker’s ability to intervene.]\n\"Go ahead.\"\nJin couldn’t understand their conversation at all, and after they spoke a few more times, he saw mana coming out of the golem’s body finely, while Lee Shin Woo’s mana filled the vacancy. Lee Shin Woo meticulously examined the entire golem once more, and then laughed with certainty.\nThe power of the darkness mana, both absolute and able to transcend logic, altered the golem’s very structure. And at the moment of his success...\n[The mode is complete, Master.]\nFrom the outside, the small golem looked like a living, breathing hawk. Its eyeballs, made of gems, focused on Lee Shin Woo and shined whilst speaking the word ’master’. This was proof that the absolute authority had been safely created; something which hadn’t existed before.\nWhat would Guillotine Steelworker think if he knew that Lee Shin Woo had completely remodeled the surveillance unit and made it devote itself to him? Of course, he would never know.\n\"Nice. From now on your name is Rem.\" [1]\n\"Your naming sense is really too much!\"\nWith the combination of his golem knowledge and his darkness magic, he had created his first ’child’, so he gave it a proper name. Hearing that, Jin was shocked. As Lee Shin Woo’s orders were absolute and it had become completely loyal to him, the observer golem could not, unfortunately, even voice its complaints, as it didn’t even have that function.\n[I understand, Master.]\nLee Shin Woo gave it a name, and right at the moment when it accepted its name... a large quantity of mana was released from Lee Shin Woo’s body, and automatically changed into the darkness element. He felt that deeply, and suddenly realized just how important a name was in a master servant contract.\nNo, maybe his mana had responded like that because he thought the name was important.\n[The Observer Golem, Rem, has been completely subordinated! Because of your achievement, you have caused a huge change in Rem.]\n\"Huh?\"\nA message similar to when he had established a master and servant relationship with the Pauls or the Chi Pauls appeared, and at the same time, Rem’s body was engulfed in darkness mana. Lee Shin Woo heard a crackingsound from within the mana, and gritted his teeth at Rem’s changing appearance.\n\"If I knew this was going to happen, I would’ve name it Rem Paul!\"\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"\nThe transformation process wasn’t very long. Rem’s now exposed form was truly shocking. What had originally looked like a living hawk from the outside had changed into bone!\nThough its body was made up of bones, they weren’t thin bones. On top of its tough, bony frame was another layer of bone, covering it like skin. It resembled a hawk and its lovely ivory, curved bone looked like it was chiseled by a sculptor, making it look extremely refined and beautiful. It looked as though it weren’t even a golem or an undead; it gave off the feeling that it was a living being made up of bone.\n\"I’d be happy if I got to look like that.\"\n\"It’s definitely pretty, but... when Guillotine asks for it, how are you going to show it to him?\"\nLee Shin Woo was both in awe and concerned as he looked at the transformed Rem. However, a message appeared in front of him that he hadn’t expected in the least.\n[Through your ability and mana, this golem has been bestowed with a karma. By acting as though it were an ally, it will approach other golems, implant your darkness into them, and ultimately cause them to change and be reborn. It has awoken this ability called \"Mana Parasite\".]\n[You have created a Joker’s pet, a cuckoo. The cuckoo will share a portion of your innate skills, and based on its role, its abilities will become even greater. Perhaps an even more dramatic evolution awaits it in the future.]\n[Lv6 Cuckoo Golem - Rem]\n\"I thought it was a bit small. It wasn’t a hawk, but a cuckoo...!?\"\n\"Why? Did you make something weird again?\"\n\"Yeah, and it’s really strange this time.\"\nThe skill that Rem had awakened was much too amazing for him to dismiss it as weird. It seemed as though him using both the administrator seal and his darkness mana, as well as acquiring the ownership authority had had a considerable effect on Rem.\nTo be honest, Lee Shin Woo himself didn’t really know how this kind of change had occurred.\n\"It probably wouldn’t work on the Steelworkers, though...\"\n\"Mmmm?\"\n\"No, it’s nothing.\"\nFrom now on, Lee Shin Woo thought he would use the same process that he’d used on Rem on any high rank golems he encountered (level 6 golems or greater that were under Steelworker’s direct control), but with this, things got a lot easier.\nHe was especially pleased by the fact that Rem could share a portion of the Joker’s innate skills (Acting, Disguise, Instigate). It meant that, at the very least, it wouldn’t be discovered by Steelworker. Moreover, based on this guy’s growth, it may be able to do something more amazing in the future.\n[Please call me Rem from now on. Master, please take care of me.]\n\"Alright, Rem. Take care of me too.\"\nHe didn’t know if Rem was aware that it had done a 180 and gone in a completely opposite direction from its original mission, as it naively perched upon Lee Shin Woo’s shoulder. That looked a lot better.\nIt had gotten a lot stronger in various aspects when it transformed into a Cuckoo Golem, so he could actually use it in battle, and it also possessed a subspace, so it would help in various ways.\nAbove all, the best part was that it had gotten smaller, so it was easier to carry around. The reason he had refused the Pauls, the golems, and the Chi Pauls from accompanying him was not only because they wanted to change the Empire, but because they were way too big, so they would get in the way of his work!\n\"Wait a sec. If this guy has a subspace and can move quickly, then... Can’t this guy collect loot!?\"\n[It is possible to change the location of my subspace, as well as automatically send anything inside to that location.]\n\"Oooooooooooooh!\"\nThey marveled at Rem’s subspace ability, the newest addition of their party, and hurried towards the winery. Rem’s Mana Parasite ability, which came from Lee Shin Woo’s karma... unfortunately, Lee Shin Woo didn’t know just how amazing that ability would be in the future.\n[1] E/N: The 렘 character here is the same Rem as the one used for Rem in Re:Zero... seems like a loose reference due to being a servant.",

    "content": "<Chapter 27. New Golem Maker - 2>\nWhen Lee Shin Woo arrived at the winery, he found that, surprisingly, Kratia had gotten there first. He told her about the lock on the winery and opened the door; whilst going down, Kratia couldn’t hold herself back and asked a question.\n\"What’s that?\"\n[My name is Rem. I am a golem who serves Master Lee Shin Woo.]\n\"I told you about it before. That they would try to use me. It was intended to be a surveillance unit.\"\n\"Was, huh... Tell me more about that.\"\nKratia was different from Jin. Jin completely gave up on understanding Lee Shin Woo, but Kratia, once she learned that Lee Shin Woo possessed a unique ability that she didn’t have, somehow understood it, opened her mind, and attempted to invent a completely new technique, even while knowing that it wouldn’t be able to replicate Lee Shin Woo’s ability.\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t the stingy type who withheld information and told her in fair detail about how he’d reprogrammed Rem and created a new command authority of ownership.\n\"The darkness element...\"\nShe’d already heard about the ability that Lee Shin Woo had gained from God (though it’s more accurate to say that it was awakened), but when Lee Shin Woo explained that he’d achieved a new feat by using the remodeled Steelworker seal in tandem with the darkness element’s mana, Kratia smiled bitterly.\n\"That’s impossible for me. Though I can think of a few ways to defend against it.\"\n\"Nice, tell me. So I can make it even better.\"\n\"Sure, as much as you want... is what I’d like to say, but before that.\"\nKratia stretched out her hand and pointed at the corridor behind them. It was filled with equipment designed to preserve wine. It was originally a winery, so it seemed obvious.\n\"Help me clear all this up first.\"\n\"Mm, I’m not going to clear those out. You see, I’m going to dig up a new space right next to it for the golem making equipment.\"\n\"Still... Isn’t this equipment useless?\"\nKratia was cutely tilting her head. That’s right. Lee Shin Woo realized that he hadn’t given her a proper explanation regarding this winery. Of course, it would be fine if he didn’t explain... it would probably be fine...\n\"Before that, shall we form a new contract, Kratia?\"\n\"It’s scary, so don’t come over while spewing black mana.\"\nThere was no way she wouldn’t be afraid of a skeleton approaching her whose eye sockets blazed with a blackish red goblin fire, and spewing out black mana with one hand.\nHowever, he had made the bilateral contract fairer, so that she would agree to the terms, and she soon realized that Lee Shin Woo was trying to help her make a solid contract.\n\"It’s a promise with mana, right? Then we’re partners now too.\"\n\"No, not really.\"\n\"You’re colder than the Winter Queen...\"\nPartners would be the best word to describe their relationship. They would help each other when they were in range of each other, and they would combine their abilities for joint research. Of course, there was a chance that that relationship became even deeper later along the line.\n\"We’ll keep each other’s secret, and if we’re in range, we help each other out. This is good enough, right?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nOnce she consented with the terms of the bilateral contract, darkness mana spread from Lee Shin Woo’s hand and intertwined both their hands. Soon, the darkness mana just melted away. A simple message appeared before Lee Shin Woo.\n[You have formed a cooperative relationship with Kratia Melloi. When you stand on the same battlefield as her, the effects of the Rebellion skill are partly shared with her.]\n\"How many abilities do you even have?\"\n\"How many species live in this world... I’m joking.\"\nHe’d formed a proper contract with Kratia, so he didn’t need to hide anything from her. He, Kratia, and Jin went past the winery and entered the underground passageway.\nBecause Lee Shin Woo had increased the security on the underground passageway the other day, Kratia still wasn’t aware of its existence until he opened it.\n\"I’m so frustrated!\"\n\"I just moved these security devices, which hid and maintained the facility even during the time of the Empire, so it makes sense that you didn’t notice it.\"\n\"But you said you’re the one who moved them!\"\nMoreover, he didn’t just move them. Lee Shin Woo had remodeled and reinforced them. It was originally very complex, but he had made it even more so; therefore, it seemed obvious that Kratia wouldn’t been able to spot it. Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs novel·fiɾe·net\n...And whenever Lee Shin Woo’s abilities grew, the security system would only grow stronger.\n\"What exactly were you hiding here? ...Ah, a vineyard!\"\nKratia remembered that Lee Shin Woo didn’t want to clear out the wine facilities, as well as when he gave her an overwhelming quantity of grapes, and quickly made a conjecture. However, she soon tilted her head.\n\"You haven’t been growing grapes here, have you?\"\n\"Yeah, I wasn’t growing grapes.\"\n\"Then were the grapes you gave me from the winery? It didn’t seem like it though...\"\n\"Mm, probably?\"\nOn Earth, grapes were definitely divided between those for wine use and eating. Grapes meant for eating would make the wine tasteless, and wine grapes, which would create a heavenly sweet tasting wine, were bitter when eaten.\nBut in Heguroa, or at least the Underground Empire, Heita, there was a very thin line dividing the two. Brewers had repeatedly experimented so that they could create a delicious wine regardless of what kind of grape they used. This was because they used magic, which didn’t exist on Earth.\n\"But there are two other factors influencing our vineyard right now.\"\n\"Two...?\"\n\"First, the power of an elf. There was a time when an elf was nearby. The reason you were able to eat those delicious grapes was because of our elven senior hero, Erian Ruparte.\"\n\"So the elf’s power still remains in the vineyard?\"\n\"Yeah. And the second one is...\"\nThen, they arrived at the end of the passageway. He’d already exterminated all the insect type monsters that had crawled into the passageway before. Lee Shin Woo checked to make sure, nodded his head, and at the end of the passageway, released the lock that he had set up.\nOnce he did that, the vineyard was revealed, as well as...\n[What is it?]\n[Who is it?]\n[Paul Zero...]\n[It’s Paul Zero!]\n[Paul Zerooooo!]\nDid the century’s superstar arrive or something? Kratia looked puzzled and looked around, but she soon received confirmation of the identity of that superstar. More than 300 Dryads lunged for Lee Shin Woo all together.\nAt the beginning, Kratia thought it was an attack and prepared to cast her magic, but... she soon realized that that was unnecessary.\n[What took you so long!?]\n[Paul Zero, your elemental power has gotten even stronger!]\n[Everyone, look! Paul Zero is using the darkness element. As I thought, you really are an elementalist!]\n[It really is true. You’ve become even cooler! Your head looks even smoother than before. Look here. Squeak, squeak...]\n\"That’s probably just you misunderst...\"\n[Paul Zero!]\n[Master, shall I attack?]\n\"No, please hold back...\"\nSoon, Lee Shin Woo’s body was buried underneath the Dryads and he could no longer be seen. What was so good about this skeleton that caused them to shriek and latch onto him!?\nKratia, who stood beside Jin and had become a third wheel, froze at the overwhelming sight, but then asked Jin a question, who wore a tired expression and looked familiar with the situation.\n\"What are... these guys...?\"\n\"Dryads. Shin Woo... Paul Zero’s diehard fans.\"\nKratia’s eyes narrowed even further. Jin sighed and whispered to her, giving her a rough explanation of what had happened. While they were doing that, Lee Shin Woo had finally gotten out of the aggressive welcoming, and was able to speak with the Dryad Princess, Sinea.\nShe nodded her head and listened as he spoke to her about Kratia, who he said was a trustworthy ally, as well as the real reason he had come to the vineyard... grape harvesting.\n[Paul Zero, you can take as many grapes as you want. We’ve had a huge effect on the grapevines, as we’ve been showering them with affection.]\n\"Thanks. Then I’ll take a look at them first.\"\nLee Shin Woo followed Sinea’s hand gesture, stretched one of the grapevines, and grabbed a bunch of grapes. They were much livelier than the ones he had harvested with Erian a few months ago.\n\"It’s almost like the grapes are shining...\"\nWith the power of an elf and the dryads, as well as the magic facilities that maintain the vineyard, it had resulted in a masterpiece!\nHe would need to check later if he could use these to create great wine, but at the very least, he was sure that these grapes were of greater quality than any normal grapes and would be hard to find anywhere.\n\"Shin... Paul Zero, this is just a basic question, but what’ll you do by making wine? ...Mm, you can’t even drink it.\"\nAs expected, Kratia asked the straightforward question. Lee Shin Woo calmly acknowledged her without looking the least bit hurt. Although he regretted not being able to eat or drink, he wasn’t stupid enough to take it out on a person who had nothing to do with it.\n\"But I can sell it.\"\n\"What are you...\"\n\"At an extremely high price too. So, how could I not try to make my own wine? Would you like to try some grapes?\"\n\"I’ve already eaten plenty because of you, but... yeah, I’ll try some.\"\nLee Shin Woo gave Kratia some grapes as his jawbone clattered. She carefully plucked a grape and placed it into her mouth, and at that moment her eyes shined in an all natural color. The only thing he could tell was that it was incredibly delicious.\nBut that wasn’t all.\n\"It’s abundant in magic. Mmm, I’m sure. You can use it as a material for potions.\"\n\"...Really?\"\n\"Really.\"\nBut unfortunately, Kratia didn’t know how to make mana potions. From the start, he had only one course of action available to him.\n[Everyone, please harvest the grapes.]\n[I understand!]\nIn the time that he hadn’t seen her, the Dryad Princess, Sinea, had become much firmer. Once she gave the order, the Dryads moved in perfect order and collected the grapes. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo realized that all those grapes wouldn’t fit in the winery, even if he used all of the free space.\n\"As I thought, we have to expand.\"\n[Paul Zero, is there anything else we can help you with?]\n\"Not yet. I’ll tell you later when I need your help.\"\n[...Ok, until then. You still have the twig I gave you, right?]\nMm, it felt weird looking straight at the Dryad Princess, Sinea, as it felt as though his every thought was right out in the open. He knew her feelings were pure, so it felt even more awkward than when he had met with God, who he and his fellow heroes were affiliated with.\nLee Shin Woo tried his very best to not look her straight in the eye, and nodded his head.\n\"I’ll be in the area for a while. You see, I plan on making wine.\"\n[Then we’ll be able to see each other often.]\nSinea laughed softly, as though she knew everything Lee Shin Woo was thinking, and kissed his cheekbone. Seeing that, Kratia flushed and lightly applauded.\n\"The romance between a skeleton and a spirit... How romantic. Ow!\"\n\"Stop spouting such crap.\"\nWhile Kratia and Jin quarreled over something trivial again, the other Dryads began to shower Lee Shin Woo with kisses, as if they were saying that they wouldn’t lose to Sinea.\nEven though he told them that he would be in the area, and that they would see each other often, it was no use. They were extremely faithful to their instincts.\n[Gliddery...]\n[Squeaky.]\n[Paul Zero, don’t go and play with us!]\n[Let’s stay here together!]\n[Master, shall I attack?]\n\"I told you to hold back.\"\nIt took Lee Shin Woo 4 minutes before he could escape the Dryads. But by the time he’d escaped, Kratia and Jin had disappeared.\nWere they jealous? Lee Shin Woo reminded himself to ask the Dryads to be affectionate with Jin later as well, and followed after them.\n[Master, behind you...]\n\"Hey, don’t follow me.\"\n[Ugeuk.]\nThree days later, Lee Shin Woo had finished with expanding the winery, and could begin manufacturing.",

    "content": "<Chapter 27. New Golem Maker - 3>\nIn order for Lee Shin Woo to set up golem manufacturing equipment, he first needed to poke a hole through the passageway that was connected with the winery. Just in case, he strengthened the passageway’s foundation so that it wouldn’t collapse. He then placed a sturdy pillar in the center, allowing him to expand the corridor.\nIt wasn’t as easy as it sounded to make more space in a dungeon, but Lee Shin Woo and Jin were assisted by Kratia, a level 7 magician, so it actually wasn’t that difficult either. Moreover...\n[I just need to make it here, right?]\n\"Yeah, thanks.\"\n[First I’ll toss it... Alright, grow!]\nBecause the Dryads realized that Lee Shin Woo was doing something underground, they kept coming out of the vineyard and meeting with him; since they were there, he asked them to help out with the construction. They were surprisingly helpful.\nHe used their power to cut off a branch of the grapevine, plant it, and make it grow, causing it to support the ceiling whilst supporting the ground as well. It was extremely durable and reduced the construction time significantly. In fact, it was so tough that he couldn’t believe it came from a grapevine.\n\"Dryads... as I thought, they’re amazing.\"\n[Compliment us more!]\nThe environment down here was much too different from that of the surface. Technology was much less efficient than magic! Lee Shin Woo cheered at the reduced estimated construction time.\nAs long as he came up with a proper design, it seemed like he would be able to expand the dungeon about ten times more without worrying about collapse. However, he didn’t have any plans on expanding the dungeon that much as of yet, so he stopped at a suitable point.\n\"There’s a lot of space left over, even if we put in the golem equipment.\"\n\"Yeah. There’s a lot of space remaining.\"\n\"Then... how about a bedroom for me?\"\nLee Shin Woo wanted to snort at her wishful thinking, but unfortunately, he didn’t have a nose to do so. Seeing how hard she was trying to get her own room, Lee Shin Woo could only shrug.\n\"I’m thinking of making the remaining space into a waiting room for my subordinates. Of course, I told them to roam around the Empire and hunt undead, but... we need a place for them to store the loot they pick up on the way, as well as a place to meet for emergencies.\"\n\"When they do gather, and the other heroes accidentally find this place, I wonder what they’ll think...\"\nIf the other heroes were to see this mixed force of Skeleton Golems, Chimeras, and Dryads, they might assume that they are the Undead Empire’s secret taskforce and may make a huge fuss over it.\n\"Alright, this way. The wires will go through the walls.\"\n\"Uaah, this is heavy.\"\n\"Is the device broken? ...I’m going to kick it softly.\"\n\"Hey, don’t!\"\nAfter Lee Shin Woo had finished setting up the equipment and tested them (he had brought the equipment that could manufacture golem cores, but he didn’t have the resources to use it right now, so he would have to leave it alone for a while), he worked on the entire area’s security, so three days just flew by.\n\"Is that it? Nice, we’re right on time.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\nLee Shin Woo took a look around the facility and muttered in satisfaction. Seeing that, Kratia tilted her head. He grinned and led his party outside towards an empty area outside of the winery. A ferocious wind was blowing.\nWhere did this wind come from, and where did it go...? Kratia thought absentmindedly, but then just tilted her head. She saw something that she hadn’t seen before the winds had started blowing.\n\"Is that... no way.\"\n\"You’re right. I told you I’d use it as a waiting room.\"\nLee Shin Woo lightly nodded his head. He spent three days organizing the facility, but at the same time, he was waiting for them. So, who were they? They were...\n[Captain, we’ve come!]\n[We’ve gathered just like you asked.]\n[Complying with Steelworker’s call.]\nThe Pauls and the golems who were spread out through the Empire’s outskirts! Aside from the Chi Pauls, who he’d just sent away, all of his forces had gathered here. Aside from occasionally calling a portion of these guys and reinforcing them, they’d never fully gathered before.\n\"Wow...\"\nKratia just laughed at the sight of a force exceeding 1,000 at the very least. Of course, the Limited Order Bone Core that Lee Shin Woo had let her borrow allowed her control golems, but she couldn’t even imagine that it would lead to something like this.\n[Sir Zero Paul, it’s been a while.]\n\"Yeah, it has. Thanks for coming.\"\nThe Undead Avenger, Shino Rendu was there as well. He’d made him the commander in chief of more than 800 Pauls, and Shino Rendu had taken the elite Pauls who were close to level 5 with him and hunted in the danger zones.\nThough his strongest subordinate was technically the level 7 Chimera Avenger, Chi Paul, Shino Rendu possessed an ability that quite closely resembled his authority as a hero, so it would be laughable to say that one was stronger than the other.\n[But is that girl next to you a...]\n\"I met her by chance. She’s a hero. Since she’s not as rigid as the other heroes and I could actually talk to her, we’ve decided to cooperate.\"\n[...As I thought, you truly are amazing, Sir Paul Zero. I’m...]\n\"Did you meet any other heroes?\"\n[I couldn’t even think of myself doing so.]\nSince Lee Shin Woo had given him that command. However, even if Lee Shin Woo hadn’t given that command, Shino Rendu wouldn’t have attempted to make contact with another hero. Because he, as a hero in the past, knew exactly how heroes reacted to the sight of an undead.\n\"Not all heroes are like her. Try to avoid other heroes from now on if you can.\"\n[...I understand.]\n\"Hi.\"\nLee Shin Woo said and then, Kratia greeted Shino Rendu, who was nodding, with a clear voice. It seemed like he had flinched for a moment, but he soon nodded his head and greeted her back.\n[I’m an Undead Avenger.]\n\"Yeah.\"\n[You’re that magician from back then!]\n[I’m awed by your open mindset of working together with humans, Captain.]\n\"Yeah, yeah. Just follow me.\"\nAround the time the past hero and the current hero finished exchanging pleasantries, the other Pauls cut in and began praising Lee Shin Woo. Because he was already used to this, Lee Shin Woo just nonchalantly ignored it and led them all to their new meeting place.\nIn the process, he taught the team leaders or higher the magic password necessary to enter. It was hard figuring out something from nothing, but memorizing a magic pattern wasn’t hard, so they were able to memorize it without much difficulty.\n\"This is your meeting place from now on. If I call, you just need to gather here. Also, all the loot you gather from around the Empire should be stored in the storehouse here.\"\n[I understand!]\n[Ooh, it’s a truly secretive facility.]\nAfter gathering all of his subordinates, Lee Shin Woo’s first agenda was using Bone Reinforcement on the Pauls. With the bones that they and the golems had gathered thus far!\nOf course, level 1 or 2 bones were pretty insignificant, so he gathered them separately. He was planning on using these bones as consumables for the gate that would transport him to other places.\n[Ooh, Sir Paul Zero! Because of you, I have...!]\n[I feel my bones becoming tougher. The acid within me is becoming stronger...!]\nIn the process, the Pauls grew to level 4 elites, and dozens of Pauls starting from Paul 41 became level 5 elites! The Pauls who were once Doom Factors gained a new, cool name: Doom Soldier.\n\"Even so, their growth is way too fast...\"\n\"Isn’t it because you awakened your darkness element’s mana?\"\n\"Mmm.\"\nThe darkness element’s mana had an effect that strengthened one’s ties with the contracted target. Thus, it was safe to assume that his darkness mana had a positive effect on them, who were contracted with him through a master and servant relationship.\nMoreover, his use of Bone Reinforcement on them was like a type of baptism! He was sure that the darkness element strengthened the effect of Bone Reinforcement. After he pushed the joyous Pauls to one side, he called over the next hitter up to bat.\n\"Now, next up are the golems.\"\n[I understand, Steelworker.]\n\"Rem, let’s start.\"\n[I understand, Master.]\nContrary to the Pauls or the Chi Pauls who completely recognized Lee Shin Woo as their superior, the golems only followed him because he possessed the Steelworker seal. If another Steelworker were to appear, then he would have to terminate them! That’s why he had been ignoring them so that he wouldn’t catch their attention. Check latest chapters at novelFirｅ.net\n’But now, the situation’s different.’\nRem, which had been infused with Lee Shin Woo’s darkness mana, flew between the lined up golems and spread the mana.\nIts ability, Mana Parasite, was an absolute ability that was effective so long as its target was a golem, but because these golems obeyed Lee Shin Woo’s commands, it didn’t take much of his mana. With just a small spray of mana...\n[Bug modification complete. It’s a pleasure, Master.]\n[I await your orders, Master.]\n[Scrapping Steelworker’s authority. Modifying program...]\nHundreds of level 4 Bronze Golems, as well as the dozens of level 5 Iron Golems, recognized Lee Shin Woo as their sole master instantaneously. With this, even if they were to meet Steelworker later, or were destroyed, they would never obey Steelworker again!\n\"Nice. Since we’re scrapping the unnecessary code, they should be able to disperse their magic and ultimately increase their average amount of magic. These guys can’t even level up, so I have to at least strengthen them like this.\"\n\"You do such ridiculous things as if it were nothing.\"\nUnfortunately, he couldn’t expect regular golems to grow. They were puppets that followed inputted orders and acted accordingly, and they weren’t autonomous. That was one of the reasons that the Emperor wanted to implant knight souls into the golems.\nGolems don’t accumulate karma. Thus, one couldn’t expect them to change. But in return, when they hunt, they gain a large amount of Perium. It’s as if the karma that should’ve gone to them is turned into Perium instead.\n\"But will it still be like that in the future?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"These golems... Can they really not grow?\"\n\"That’s one of the prerequisites to a golem. They obviously shouldn’t be able to, right?\"\nKratia didn’t immediately reply to Lee Shin Woo and she just gazed at the cuckoo golem, Rem, which had finished its mission and had returned to Lee Shin Woo’s shoulder. Rem, as if knowing that she was staring at it, tilted its head, its appearance like bone craftwork.\n\"It awakened a skill it didn’t have before, so I thought maybe they could grow too.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nLee Shin Woo thought what she said wasn’t entirely wrong, and observed Rem, but like with Kratia, it just tilted its head. Now that he thought about it, he definitely remembered seeing a message saying that the Mana Parasite ability would grow...\n’I just have to wait and see I guess.’\nIf it was the involvement of the darkness element’s mana that brought about the change, then he would be able to figure it out immediately; Lee Shin Woo thought that would be entertaining and clapped.\n\"Then shall we start in earnest?\"\n\"Finally!\"\nKratia’s eyes shined. Lee Shin Woo vigorously gave out commands.\n\"Pauls, you guys have to find an underground mine. Silver or gold is best.\"\n[I understand!]\n\"A gemstone mine is fine too. In any case, you need to find a mine with metal that can contain a large quantity of magic. For the time being, you guys won’t be fighting, and your main priority should be searching!\"\n[I’ll keep that in mind!]\nThe Pauls responded vigorously, and they soon departed, but contrary to Lee Shin Woo, who looked at them imposingly, Jin and Kratia looked on vacantly. They were expressions that seemed to indicate that they couldn’t understand why he gave them that order. Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and explained.\n\"Did you really think we’d be able to make golems right away? We can’t make them with just the cores. We obviously need the metal that makes up their bodies.\"\n\"How can you not make them with the materials you have on hand?\"\nLee Shin Woo knew exactly what Kratia was talking about. She wanted him to make golems with bone. Of course, Lee Shin Woo knew that it would eventually come to this. And thus...\n\"I have to use the high leveled bones to strengthen the Pauls. So, I’ll change metal or gems into bone and create bones that way. The right man for the right job.\"\nHe didn’t know if using high leveled monster bones would be beneficial in the construction of golems, but to be blunt, it was a huge waste of resources. One golem would require hundreds or even thousands of bones to create, so using those high leveled bones on the Pauls would be much more effective in comparison!\nHowever, what if he were to transform the gemstones or the ore? They were inefficient to use on skeletons, but they should be effective in the creation of golems!\n\"I’ll definitely be able to create golems that won’t lose out to the ones Arema Steelworker has.\"\n\"Then... what are you going to do while the Pauls are looking for a mine?\"\nKratia, who thought they’d be able to manufacture golems once the facility was complete, was disappointed and asked. Lee Shin Woo grinned and turned around. It was there. The Kerr Century Winery’s equipment that was used for the best wine in the Empire...!\n\"We have to make wine with our obedient golem friends!\"\n\"...\"\nKratia wanted to back out, but she realized that Lee Shin Woo’s cooperative contract forbade her from leaving whenever she wanted, and bitterly hit the ground. That was the moment that the newbie hero, Kratia, had realized that she couldn’t recklessly sign a contract.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 27 part4",
    "content": "<Chapter 27. New Golem Maker - 4>\nBecause of Lee Shin Woo’s job on Earth, he had quite the diverse skill set, and his competence was praised by those around him. But even so, that didn’t go into producing wine.\nThe reason he even attempted to make wine was because the winery kept the technicians’ records. And in addition, there was someone he could trust...\n\"Hello, Pleine. I’m here.\"\n\"Guten Morgen! Oh my. Now that I think about it, it hasn’t been that long since we last met, Mr. Lee Shin Woo.\"\nPleine greeted him enthusiastically, waved her hand at him, stopped, and tilted her head. Soon, her eyes moved in a crescent motion. She was laughing with a satisfied expression, so she was definitely thinking about something weird.\n\"Did you make some money in that short period of time? No, there’s no way you did. No matter how badly you want to see me, you can’t waste your permits to the secret shop. Didn’t I tell you that each and every permit was like a portion of God’s grace?\"\n\"I have a lot of money, though.\"\n\"You don’t need to try so hard to lie... Mm.\"\nLee Shin Woo said calmly, and his lips curled upwards; at some point, Pleine, who had been probing him, blinked quickly. Was she trying to brag about her eyelashes? Of course, it didn’t have much of an effect on Lee Shin Woo.\nThen, her eyes shined. She let go of her chin, and asked seriously.\n\"This would be unbelievable, but the one who defeated one of the 12 generals...\"\n\"Oh, that was me.\"\n\"Oh, God...\"\nIt had been a long time since Pleine had looked to God for help, as it seemed like she didn’t even really like God that much. She should’ve heard about the general’s death from God herself, so it seemed like she just didn’t know who had killed him.\n\"I believe that your growth is incredibly fast, and that you have abilities much greater than your level might imply, but to think you already defeated a general. What are the other heroes doing?\"\n\"I’d like to ask the same thing.\"\nLee Shin Woo sighed and replied, but recognized that it was tough to expect the same things from the other heroes.\nHe utilized his karma’s unique properties to infiltrate the city, borrow the strength of several undead, and had even manipulated the Treasure Eater, which had come at an opportune time, to defeat Hansen.\n\"That’s good news. You see, I heard that someone had killed a general, but I didn’t know who exactly did it or how. To think that you were the one who killed him! You’re free, right? Please tell me all the details.\"\n\"If you want to hear about it, then you need to help me. You see, I have something I really want.\"\n\"Mmm, alright. So hurry up and tell me all about it.\"\nIt might’ve been the vibe, but Pleine seemed a bit rushed. Lee Shin Woo tilted his head, picked out the core details, and told her about what happened. She looked intrigued at around the midway point.\n\"Hansen Von Dorthe... I see, he is indeed someone that you could face. Most were reluctant to face him 1 on 1, but you possessed a similar ability to him, Mr. Shin Woo.\"\n\"To be honest, certain parts of his ability were strange.\"\nAt that final moment of their 1 on 1 fight, and then experiencing those dense memories by absorbing his bone. At the time, Lee Shin Woo felt that his swordsmanship was a bit familiar.\nHe wasn’t just talking about Hansen’s ability to use lightning. Though Hansen had been debuffed, he had been able to predict his sword’s course and the power behind it, so it wasn’t very difficult for him to dodge. In other words, that meant...\n\"You’re right. God created Bursting Thunder by gathering several skills. The Lightning Shadow General’s swordsmanship is also in there.\"\n\"As I thought.\"\nNow he understood why he could absorb so many of Hansen’s memories. It was because he already knew swordsmanship that was closely related to Hansen’s.\nHe had solved the puzzle, so he sported a refreshed expression, but was faced with a truly mysterious expression; he didn’t know whether Pleine was looking at him in wonder, or if she was relieved.\n\"I can understand why God was so excited now. I thought you’d die several times against a general and would have to aim for their weak spot to win. Of course, that in and of itself is plenty amazing, but God raising the maximum level of Invisible Heart was to take that into account...\"\nTo think that he would take down a general without losing a single life. Rather than using any lives, he’d just increased his maximum lives with Invisible Heart.\nMoreover, whenever he defeated an undead hero and put them to rest, the maximum level of Invisible Heart would increase, so it wouldn’t be impossible for the maximum level of Invisible Heart to continue to increase.\n\"What’s the point in even stockpiling them?\"\n\"Please just save them. They’ll be really helpful later when you’re faced with a lot of danger.\"\nAnd if he managed to save them to the very end... Lee Shin Woo let it go, shrugged his shoulder, and discarded such thoughts. His abilities were still lacking, and the chance of that was quite slim.\n\"In any case, my goal is to have a quiet and peaceful life no matter what it takes.\"\n\"How can a level 6 hero who took down a general say that? Any hero passing by would laugh at that.\"\n\"Of course they would. They would say ’what kind of hero is that?’.\"\nIn the process of defeating Hansen, Lee Shin Woo realized that his actions and his plans weren’t all that praiseworthy.\nOf course, he didn’t feel anything like embarrassment, and although he never really cared about other people’s opinions and was satisfied with the Joker karma...\n\"But you know, you’re probably the most hero-like out of all the heroes I’ve seen.\"\n\"...That’s quite surprising. Did you actually hear my explanation?\"\nPleine spoke with such a serious expression, so it became a bit embarrassing for him. Because it was embarrassing, he decided to just accept the compliment and move on, but Pleine added more.\n\"Since you can’t hide your good-heartedness, no matter how cynical you may act.\"\n\"I really hate human drama.\"\n\"That’s quite a coincidence. I really hate human dramas as well. However...\"\nPleine smiled mischievously.\n\"My friend once told me. There is not one person loved by spirits who is a bad person. You’re completely covered in the marks of the Dryads, so I guess that’s not really persuasive.\"\n\"...\"\nAs expected, this misunderstanding was because of the Dryads! He needed to explain how he got involved with the Dryads, but that would just prove that he was rotten to the core, so it felt kind of weird. However, he then thought back to Sinea’s pure gaze and felt that it was complicated, so he decided to just let it go.\n\"Just sell me some stuff.\"\n\"Ah, how embarrassing.\"\n\"I want the bone of a wine manufacturer. Please cooperate like you promised.\"\n\"A wine manufacturer!?\"\nPleine, whose head had been filled with ways of teasing Lee Shin Woo, changed immediately! She pushed her body across the counter in an instant and tightly grabbed Lee Shin Woo’s bony hand.\n\"Are you going to create a winery!? Ah, now that I think about it, you told me that you cleared out an entire winery... There’s a vineyard that’s still alive! Are the winery’s facilities still intact?\"\n\"Correct answer.\"\n\"But you usually wouldn’t even think to create wine from there again...!\"\n\"I have some manpower.\"\n\"Keuk, Kerr Century’s wine... They’re renowned for their extremely sweet and delicious wine that’s created through their special ripening process. Ripening them for dozens of years may be impossible, but if you continue to go in that direction...! No, I have to find that bone no matter what, no matter what...!\"\nPleine seemed to talk a lot more than usual, and eventually, she was lost in her own little world. However, when Lee Shin Woo engaged her in conversation, Pleine stood up suddenly and yelled.\n\"I’ll find it no matter what!\"\n\"Ooh...\"\n\"I’ll give you some books on wine, so please read those while you’re waiting! You know how important theory is!\"\n\"Ah, I understand.\"\nLee Shin Woo, who was frightened by Pleine’s sudden drive, meekly sat down and perused the books she’d given him. Before he could work on replicating Kerr Century Winery’s technique, he needed to have a basic understanding of wine, so these books, which laid out the basics for him, were incredibly helpful.\nHe quickly read through a few volumes, and when he thought about buying these books and going home, he raised his head.\n\"I found it!\"\nPleine’s eyes glimmered, and stuck out a few bones towards him. There were two level 1 bones, one level 2 bone, and surprisingly, one level 4 elite bone.\n\"Fortunately, I had these in storage. Why are you so surprised? The reason for the Kerr Century Winery’s groundbreaking technique and security was because it was protected by a renowned family of magicians for generations.\"\n\"I see. Thank you... So how much is it?\"\n\"30,000 Perium.\"\nNo matter how he thought about it, that was a really low price for a bundle including a level 4 elite bone. However, Lee Shin Woo just decided to pay at her asking price.\n[Absorbing a Lv4 Skeleton Wizard’s skull through Bone Reinforcement. Absorbing a significant amount of memories and experiences.]\n[This facility is alive. That is how we made it... in order for it to be in the optimum environment for fermentation and maturation - Unknown Magic Master Craftsman]\nPleine, who had been watching him, snorted once he was done absorbing the bones, and asked.\n\"How is it? Do you know how to do it?\"\n\"No, the information is too complex, so... It seems like I’ll have to learn by doing.\"\n\"Do your best...! The revival of the Kerr Century Winery lies in your hands, Mr. Shin Woo!\"\nPleine grabbed onto his hands tightly and yelled desperately. It seemed as though she thought the Kerr Century Winery was more important than killing a general... Lee Shin Woo just responded with a smile.\n\"Please let go. So I can go and try.\"\nOnce Lee Shin Woo had left the shop, amongst all those waiting for him, a Dryads reacted first. It was one of the Dryads that really liked and followed Lee Shin Woo.\n[I smell another woman’s scent on you, Paul Zero.]\n\"’You know you can’t do that’ is third on my personal ranking of lines I want to hear a woman say at least once in my life, so thanks.\"\n\"What are you always doing over there that makes you come back so late?\"\n\"That woman seemed quite unpleasant.\"\nThey kept showering him with complaints, and once Lee Shin Woo checked the time, he realized that four hours had already passed. He told them about what he’d talked about with Pleine, and explained that he’d come back late because he had to wait for her to find the bones.\n\"You may understand if you watch what I’m about to do.\"\n\"Mmmm?\"\n\"Ah, could you call a few Dryads over? I feel like I’ll need your help to make wine.\"\n[Of course! Just wait sec. I’ll bring some!]\nThe Dryad rushed over to the vineyard. Lee Shin Woo gathered all of the golems, took out a large container, and poured all the grapes out. Thıs content belongs to novel✦fire.net\n\"Alright. Then shall we start with mashing the grapes? In order to create this year’s Kerr Century Nouveau...!\"\n\"Ah, you just said Nouveau, right!? That’s French!\"\nLee Shin Woo completely ignored Jin’s retort, and started mashing the grapes. The level 4 golems followed his lead and began moving diligently. The Bronze Golems and up had the basic ability of synchronizing with each other.\n\"The fact that you’re using this many golems to do this is...\"\n\"Shin Woo, you’re always so surprising and exhilarating...\"\n\"That’s not enough! Watch, and follow me more closely!\"\nLee Shin Woo was saying something strange again, but Jin and Kratia, who were both used to his eccentricity, didn’t say anything in response. No matter what they said, the golems would just continue to mash the grapes.\nThe Pauls were searching the Empire for a mine, and Lee Shin Woo and the golems were making wine. Work was in full swing.",

    "content": "<Chapter 27. New Golem Maker - 5>\nLee Shin Woo mashed grapes with its skin and seeds, and placed the gruesome looking contents safely into an oak barrel and then placed the stopper into it. After that, he sighed, and declared that their work was done. That was their last oak barrel just now.\n\"We don’t need to worry about these for about two days. Bring all of them to the fermenting room.\"\n[I understand.]\nThe hundreds of golems moved the oak barrels to the fermenting room one by one. Due to the magical equipment set up by the wine makers, the temperature was thoroughly regulated 24 hours every day, all year around; thus, it was one of the two facilities that served as the core of the winery. The other was obviously the ripening room, which was used after the fermentation process was complete.\n\"The other processes are helpful, but... if I master how to ripen and bottle the wine, I can just keep a few golems here to make sure everything goes smoothly.\"\n\"That’d be a real wine factory...\"\nAt the very least, the golems possessed a good grasp on how to copy a human’s movements. Moreover, they were strong and possessed infinite stamina, so only a few golems had been needed to manage this huge winery.\nMoreover, so long as he had the Dryads’ aid, he had an infinite supply of grapes, and he could keep the winery’s equipment semi-permanently active!\n\"Let’s say that we can sell that wine at a good price... What are you going to do with that money? Are you going to buy the secret shop?\"\n\"Mm, you bring up a good point.\"\nTo be honest, there wasn’t really much for Lee Shin Woo to buy in the secret shop. Skill books were so popular that whenever they came in they were immediately sold, and he didn’t need food from the very beginning. Bones... they might work on the Pauls, but Lee Shin Woo and Jin had grown too much to develop further through the secret shop’s bones.\nThen equipment? Unfortunately, Lee Shin Woo had already absorbed a variety of level 2, 3, and even level 4 equipment.\nOf course, when he absorbs a new and unique piece of equipment, he does gain some stats, but the more those types or characteristics overlap, the less he gains from them, so even they were limited.\nWhat about finding a way to use Perium independently? Unfortunately, Lee Shin Woo’s abilities were still lacking for him to do so. Lee Shin Woo had already made up his mind from the start.\n\"I’m planning on buying materials for golem cores. Since I want to start that properly first.\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\n\"It’d probably be a good idea to buy other materials that make up a golem’s body. Though it would be best if the Pauls find a mine.\"\n\"A wine factory and a golem factory...\"\nIt was the collaboration of the century. If he were to successfully create wine and sell it, and obtain golem cores and create golems... what would be the result? Even the very thought of it was scary, so he decided not to think about it.\n\"Kratia, let’s begin in earnest.\"\n\"Hoo, I’ve been waiting for you to say that.\"\nBecause he was fermenting the grapes, Lee Shin Woo used the remaining time to study golems with Kratia. They read all of the books that they took from the secret facility, and remodeling the techniques that were out of their reach was their first priority.\nNext, Lee Shin more thoroughly analyzed his transformed Bone Core, and would adjust it to design golems. He decided to form a broad plan that could respond regardless of what material was used for the golems.\n\"In the end, you’re going to make them with all bones, right? The materials have the same core properties, so it shouldn’t be very hard.\"\n\"Let’s assume I turn them all into bone. It feels like we won’t need this part...\"\n\"But I feel like this joint region should be reinforced.\"\n\"How about making specialized armaments that are split into various patterns, depending on the characteristics of the transformed bone?\"\n\"Ah, that sounds good. Cool.\"\n\"...\"\nJin felt alienated as their uninterruptible conversation progressed; he saw Kratia’s face, who was excitedly chatting with Lee Shin Woo, and he felt a feeling that was difficult to describe.\n\"But if you do that, then the movement formula over here is... Jin?\"\n\"I’m going to go for a walk.\"\nJin remained still, and thought he might end up venting his anger on Lee Shin Woo again, even though he was innocent, and went outside. Contrary to the inside of the dungeon, which overflowed with life energy, the outside was still filled with a bleak and heavy air.\n\"Hoooooo.\"\nThe curse that permeated the Empire. Though the mana and essence Lee Shin Woo had gained was similar to it, it had manifested in a completely different form, and Jin absorbed it. Lee Shin Woo had taught him the know-how, so if he wanted, he could absorb the curse four to five times faster than before.\nThe curse’s mana rushed towards his body, and during the duration of the absorption, he felt refreshed. Because of that, he could get a hold of himself.\n\"...Seriously, what the hell am I doing?\"\nHe remembered how much he’d overreacted when he saw his partner interact with someone else and sighed.\nNo matter how preposterous Lee Shin Woo’s actions or words were, he was only focused on becoming stronger. That was the whole point of making wine as well as creating golems.\nAnd he didn’t really think about his relations with the Dryads, Kratia, or the shopkeeper, Pleine. That’s because he was nothing more than a bony skeleton.\n’Thinking about it doesn’t help me at all. I have to work harder.’\nHe’d pledged several times that he wouldn’t slow Lee Shin Woo down, yet whenever he seemed to catch up, Lee Shin Woo would already be a step ahead, which made his efforts seem laughable. However, he couldn’t allow that to happen anymore. They’d already taken down one of the 12 generals. All he’d done to contribute in that battle was allow Kratia and Lee Shin Woo to ride on his back and run.\nLee Shin Woo told him that that was plenty, but Jin couldn’t accept that. If he was just going to run fast, then he wouldn’t be any different from his past life. He wanted to be a bit more helpful to his partner.\n[If you’ve decided to give it everything you’ve got to keep up with him, then this ability will surely shine brighter. Mm, I’ll make it an ability for you alone.]\nThen, Jin remembered what God had told him. When Lee Shin Woo had acquired a new element from God, Jin obviously gained a new ability from her as well.\nHe’d wanted a powerful ability that would be effective against the powerful opponents Lee Shin Woo faced, and God refined his skill. That was Jin’s first high rank skill.\n’Good. Let’s surprise him.’\nHe grinded his teeth, and began to run. Because Lee Shin Woo was busy with his manufacturing, Jin decided to use his free time to practice this skill so that he could use it freely in battle.\n[High Rank Magic Breath Lv1]\n[You draw magic to your body, change it into destructive energy, and shoot it in a straight line. It can contain the power of an element, and if it does, the destructive force increases.]\nThe skill was one of the two skills he’d gained from the Treasure Eater’s jawbone (the other skill was Lv1 High Rank Lightning Resistance), and God had reinforced it with her power.\nBecause the skill was originally only usable by those who could wield lightning, it was completely useless to Jin at first. God had processed it so that Jin could use it.\n’It’s funny, an undead breathing... But alright, I’m gathering it.’\n\"Huwaaaaahk!\"\n[Kuhak!?]\nOnce Jin had gathered enough mana, he opened his mouth and spewed the energy. A highly compressed, soft blue mana laser was shot out in a straight line; after he emptied about half his energy, a undead panther roaming around the plains was completely melted away, creating a giant hole in the ground.\n’It’s pretty weak for a high rank skill... it’s like I’m firing a blank.’\nHe could use the skill like this, but the skill could only unleash its full power by using it in tandem with an element. Jin couldn’t use the elements, but if Lee Shin Woo were to help him a little, he would be able to contain acid, fire, ice, lightning, everything.\nIt would be completely useless without Lee Shin Woo. Jin was finally able to gain a skill like this. He’d grown significantly since he had first been dropped into the Empire, just running in order to escape reality.\n’Alright. Let’s make sure I got it down and then go.’\nJin steeled himself and began to move. First, he needed to be able to freely control the output of Magic Breath, and then, he needed to be able to use it whilst sprinting, or at least several times in battle... He considered every application of the skill and went through intense training.\n’If it were Shin Woo, he wouldn’t allow it to feel unnatural.’\nLee Shin Woo was both hot-blooded and calm during combat. How could he contribute in a way that removed all the variables and achieved victory... Jin kept those in mind and moved his body around, losing track of time.\nThree weeks had passed in no time, and then, Lee Shin Woo contacted him.\n[Lee Shin Woo: We’re about to make history here, where are you? It’s my fault, so come back.]\n\"Make history? Are you finally making a golem?\"\n[Lee Shin Woo: No, the wine’s done.]\n\"...\"\nThis guy, he’s definitely making wine to get stronger, right...? Now that he thought about it, Jin remembered that this was just the type of guy Lee Shin Woo was, sighed, and returned to the winery.\nJin, who had run everywhere and practiced his skill, had even gone through a level 3 danger zone; when Lee Shin Woo wasn’t riding him, he could run at a speed akin to light, so he was able to return in just a few hours.\n\"You’re not late!\"\n\"What about the golems?\"\n\"We finished adjusting the basic equipment just yesterday, but the Pauls haven’t come back yet.\"\nRecreating the technique of making golems, considered the most difficult field in magic engineering, in a few weeks was quite impressive; but Jin didn’t really understand any of it and just nodded his head.\n\"Then let’s put the wine into the bottles I bought from the secret shop...\"\n[As you command, Master.]\nHis assistants, no, the golems followed Lee Shin Woo’s demonstration and busily moved around, bottling the wine which had finished ripening. Lee Shin Woo raised the first completed wine bottle and checked its information.\n[Kerr Century Elemental 451]\n[This wine was created by Kerr Century Winery’s successor, with grapes that thrived with the love and affection of the spirits and an elf. It’s still somewhat lacking in terms of technique, but the raw materials, which are extremely difficult to obtain, emit a rich smell and have the right acidity to mask that flaw.]\n[It is a masterpiece that shows the quality of the ingredients. Even after it was bottled, the magic within the materials causes the wine to ripen gradually, so the longer you leave it, the more valuable it becomes.]\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Did you fail?\"\n\"No... That’s not it.\"\nLee Shin Woo had put his heart and soul into the gathering and juice extraction, and then the fermentation and the ripening, so there was no way he could’ve failed. He saw the quality of the grapes and they would make a great Nouveau, so that’s what he made, yet... the completed product wasn’t a Nouveau.\n\"Is it because they’re grapes affected by the Dryads...?\"\n\"But it just means that you can sell them for more, right?\"\n\"Yeah, you can say that.\"\nHe was still tilting his head, but he decided to let it go as it had turned out well. No, before that.\n\"Kratia, I’m counting on you to try it.\"\n\"...It’s an honor.\"\nKratia, looking slightly anxious, held out her wine glass, and Lee Shin Woo poured the wine. She took a sip of the wine, and Lee Shin Woo, Jin, the Dryads, and the golems all focused their attention onto her. ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ novel-fire.net\n\"How is it?\"\n\"...If it sucks, you can spit it out.\"\n[I want to try it too...!]\n\"...Good.\"\nA brief moment passed, and Kratia, who’d swallowed down the wine, quietly gave him a thumbs up. Then, she carefully pushed her glass forward once more, so it seemed like she really liked the wine.\nThrough the power of the spirits, the Kerr Century Winery had returned.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 27 part6",
    "content": "<Chapter 27. New Golem Maker - 6>\nHe was able to earnestly start making golems around the time he finished making the wine. His elite troops, led by Shino Rendu, had found an abandoned emerald mine! Lee Shin Woo couldn’t help but be excited.\n\"There was nothing more I could hope for if it were silver or gold, but to think they would find an emerald mine!\" Follow current novᴇls on noⅴelfire.net\nIn this world, gems can generally store a large amount of mana, and was much easier to infuse mana into compared to regular metal. That was the reason most magical devices were created out of gemstones.\nOf course, because gems were so valuable, Lee Shin Woo had previously thought that finding a mine with enough gems would be impossible, yet...\n[We found a mine shaft, but it feels like it hasn’t been long since it was mined. I believe it should yield enough for you to build hundreds of golems.]\n\"Alright. Just start collecting!\"\nLee Shin Woo led the Pauls and the golems, finished with making wine, towards the emerald mine.\nWho could stop them, when his troops were at least level 4 elites? They pushed ahead and went into the mine immediately. It seemed like there were monsters that were inside originally, but Shino Rendu and his group had killed them all without a trace.\n\"They’re not at the entrance...\"\n[If you come in a bit more, then you’ll see something like this.]\nThe gemstone, radiating a green light, was the size of Shino Rendu’s fist. If he cut it a bit, then it would probably emit an even prettier light, but it wasn’t like he was going to sell it, and their ultimate goal was golem production! He planned on getting rid of any unnecessary steps!\n[But it seems like there’s a small problem. Do you see the thick curse energy that has gathered inside?]\n\"Ah, you’re right.\"\nMines weren’t dungeons. Which meant that they were continuously exposed to the curse. As emeralds absorbed any sort of mana, none of them had become weak or broken apart. However, they were filled to the brim with the curse’s energy.\n[Emerald Gemstone]\n[A gemstone capable of containing a large amount of mana, as well as distributing it. But because it was exposed to the curse for hundreds of years, it is filled to the brim with the curse, and will not be easy to process.]\n\"It’s not really such a big deal. It might take a while, but I just need to absorb it all. Above all, I’ve become able to use the darkness element, so... Ah.\"\nHe had definitely forgotten what his ability was for a moment. By the time Lee Shin Woo realized that, the emerald was already changing... in other words, it was ossifying.\nBut that process was quite dramatic. The curse within began to resist, but it soon seemed to realize that it was an unwinnable battle, and all at once, became pure darkness energy!\nMagic spread throughout the ossifying gemstone, and radiated a calm, dark green light. It was an incredibly capricious and charming light.\n[Dark Emerald Bone]\n[A bone created by compressing the gemstone’s essence. It is charged with a powerful darkness energy, and is now unmatched in terms of hardness and magic.]\n\"Oh... I don’t know what really happened, but it seems like you’ve taken care of it.\"\n\"You’re always like this.\"\nKratia, as though she had already expected this to happen, was given the Dark Emerald Bone. Though it was smaller than the original gemstone, its hardness and magic were much, much higher, so it had become a different class of material altogether.\n\"It’s probably because this gemstone previously contained the curse’s magic as well.\"\n\"Yeah. It seems like it responded to my darkness element, and the curse energy changed into pure darkness.\"\n[The darkness element... I see, that’s the reason you are able to fight against the curse that’s covering the Empire.]\nIt seemed like Shino Rendu, who was listening to their conversation, was having a huge misunderstanding, but since it didn’t matter what he thought, Lee Shin Woo just let it go.\n\"Then, shall we begin mining!? Everyone’s ready, right!?\"\n[Of course!]\n[We’re ready whenever!]\n\"Good. Start!\"\nAnd so, 800 Pauls and 400 golems began the extensive mining. There was no way the mining wouldn’t progress quickly, as there were 1,200 of them that were at least level 4, rather than being level 1 miners! Even if the mine shaft collapsed while they were at it, they would be able to get out unscathed due to their strong bodies, so there was no need to progress safely!\n\"What do we do in the meantime? Should we help with the mining too?\"\n\"We’ve never been here before, so let’s explore and clear any nearby dungeons we find. If there’s a city nearby, it’ll become a pain in the ass, so we’ll look into that as well.\"\n\"Ok.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s party left the mine and began exploring. Fortunately, there wasn’t a city in the vicinity, and he thought that that might’ve been the reason that this emerald mine hadn’t been properly developed.\n\"It’s an empty area. We were lucky. The closest satellite city is an hour away with Jin’s speed.\"\n\"Then, for the time being, we won’t be getting into any fights.\"\nBecause there wasn’t a city nearby, there was a high chance that there weren’t any other heroes in this area either. However, as if waiting for him to say that, Rem, which was on top of Lee Shin Woo’s shoulder, suddenly shook.\n[Master, I sense golems.]\n\"You’re not talking about the one’s mining, right?\"\n[No. I sense golems that are under Stake Steelworker’s control.]\n\"What a delicious sounding name...\" [1]\nThe movement of golems under one of the Four Commanders’ control. Why were they here? Lee Shin Woo thought that their objective might be the same as his. They were looking for gems so that they could make new golems.\nFortunately, Lee Shin Woo’s party had made the first move, but if they had encountered the golems on the way, it would’ve become a bit troublesome.\n’They definitely don’t know about how I cleared out the hidden facility and destroyed it.’\nIf not, then they might’ve sent a collection team over there, and simultaneously, sent golems over here as well. He did several things that hurt them, but... there was no way he could just let them go.\n\"Stake Steelworker? Has he shown up personally?\"\n[No. Twenty level 6 elite golems are moving secretly in a group.]\n\"If you say so.\"\nHe didn’t need to think about it anymore. Lee Shin Woo raised his hand and removed his equipment, starting from the helmet all the way down to his boots. Then, his armor turned blue, and he held the Bifurcated Spine Whip, so he didn’t look anything like his preexisting image.\n\"Rem, you go first. We’ve found some rare specimen, so there’s no way we can kill them.\"\n[I understand.]\nArema Steelworker’s Golden Army usually moved stealthily.\nThe reason Lee Shin Woo was even able to notice them in advance was because he had Rem, who possessed a specialized ability for sensing their presence.\n’I think this is the first time I’ve seen (his) level 6 golems act.’\nThat’s just how cautious Arema Steelworker was. That meant that this mission was important enough for someone as cautious as him to mobilize his golems, but why did they have to run into Lee Shin Woo? Perhaps... perhaps Arema Steelworker was giving him a freebie!\n’There’s nothing more I can ask for if I can study a level 6 golem personally before making them.’\n\"Want help?\"\n\"No, I’m good.\"\nThough it hadn’t been very long since he’d turned level 6, because he’d achieved so many feats, Lee Shin Woo’s stats were greater than 4,800.\nPlus, when he took into account his Rebellion skill, which passively increased his stats, no level 6 would be able to threaten him.\n\"Plus, it’s not like I’m staking my life on their capture. They’re golems, so they’re not very dangerous. So just relax and wait here.\"\nLee Shin Woo said, and with his other hand, softly stroked Jin’s back. Jin was shocked and his body shook.\n\"Geuik!? Hey!\"\n\"Don’t make such strange noises. You’re good now, right?\"\n\"Mm... Mm?\"\nHe wasn’t being crabby for no reason. With his soft hand movement, Lee Shin Woo had activated his Disguise skill on Jin as well. His armor was covered in ice, and Lee Shin Woo and Jin, as a matching set, looked like an ice spirit.\n\"Kuuu... Still, you should’ve told me something!\"\n\"Oh, my bad.\"\nJin had been indifferent until now as he realized that patience and introspection were pointless with Lee Shin Woo. Lee Shin Woo reacted a lot stronger than he thought he would, which confirmed that he did indeed realize that he was in the wrong.\nWhen working as a team, team members will often not need to speak their mind and will move without being told, as they trust their teammate. Though they faced life and death together, that may have been too much to ask for from Jin.\n\"In the future, I’ll tell you beforehand. You see, I only recently thought about the fact that I could use Disguise on you as well.\"\n\"That’s not the problem here... Ah, whatever!\"\nSeeing that, Kratia chuckled, but when her eyes met with Jin’s blazing goblin fire, she closed her mouth shut. Jin thought about giving Kratia a good kick when he got back, and changed his back feet into springs. Now he could change them into springs in the blink of an eye.\n\"Then... I’m going!\"\n\"Hey, you’re too fast!\"\nLee Shin Woo and Jin were soon able to see the golems that were moving slowly from afar. Even in the cloudy weather, their bodies shined, and they possessed an overwhelming magic. They were unmistakably level 6 golems. He gazed at their bodies, shining in silver, but even if he didn’t see them, he would be able to figure out what they were.\n[Lv6 Silver Golem]\n\"As I thought.\"\n\"Is it ok if we just leave them be until the cuckoo infects them all?\"\n\"If we wait for that, then they’ll find the mine. The lower the magic, or the weaker they are, the more effective Mana Parasite is. So, we have to suck out their magic.\"\nAnd they ran towards them, unintentionally going at an outrageously fast speed!\n[Encountering unknown enemy.]\n[Intercepting. Preparing magic.]\n[Long distance attacks... are impossible; the enemy is approaching!]\nThe golems noticed them, and each raised their weapons and magic, but before they could even attack, they were struck by a whip and stopped moving. Lee Shin Woo continuously attacked with his whip, which was clad in ice energy in order to quickly lower their magic resistance.\n[Status ailment. Attempting to remove it by infusing mana. Failed. Trying again.]\n[Judged as an intermediate status ailment. It is only minor damage, but it will take a long time to recover from the status ailment. Self-recovery is impossible.]\n\"Yeah, just keeping talking!\"\nThe Bifurcated Spine Whip emitted a horrifying sound, and stretched out. It was as if two snakes were moving through the air and had found their prey.\n\"Heup...!\"\nIn an instance, Lee Shin Woo snapped the whip, and swung it. It bent flexibly, and in a short time, battered the golems dozens, if not hundreds of times, causing ice flowers to instantaneously spread on the twenty golems!\n[Situation critical. Impossible to continue mission.]\n[Reporting to superiors. ...Cannot connect.]\nThe reason they couldn’t connect was because Rem had infiltrated into their ranks and disabled their reporting program while Lee Shin Woo and Jin were fighting them. If they prioritized disabling their means of communication, then Lee Shin Woo would be able to take his time. Going through their command system was next.\n\"Nice. Then, shall we finish this up quickly?\"\nAt last, Lee Shin Woo summoned another whip and gripped it in his free hand. He turned all of his magic into ice energy and began whirling around his two whips. Jin could feel that and requested.\n\"Let me assimilate that.\"\n\"So... the ice?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Wait, why... I got it.\"\nLee Shin Woo constantly swung his two whips and the golems, which were slowly approaching from all sides, were slowed. On the other hand, he shared his mana with Jin. He could do it easily if he were to just apply a portion of the Lightning Sprint’s mana pattern.\n\"Hueuuup.\"\n\"Huh!?\"\nThen, Jin used that ice as a medium and gathered mana in his mouth. Lee Shin Woo felt the instantaneously amplified mana and his goblin fire swayed.\n\"Breath!?\"\n\"Heup!\"\nA thick cylindrical cannon came out of Jin’s mouth. No, that’s what it looked like at first, but soon, it curved outwards. It looked like a trumpet, and the large quantity of ice within...\n\"Puhwaaaaaaaahk!\"\nThe mana was discharged through the trumpet shaped cannon, spreading everywhere! The twenty golems were well within the attack’s range, and were instantly frozen solid.\n\"You...\"\n\"How is it?\"\nIt wasn’t just a simple ’Magic Breath’; he could create a varied cannon to adjust the attack to match the situation. This was Jin’s first combined skill. Lee Shin Woo automatically clapped at the boasting Jin and said.\n\"If you had just told me about it from the get go, I wouldn’t have had to rush in.\"\n\"Shut up.\"\nLee Shin Woo really couldn’t understand Jin, so Jin acted like it was a rodeo and shook his body. Then, Rem finished with his Mana Parasite. By attempting to resist the ice, they had completely used up all of their mana, so Rem could use his Mana Parasite without any resistance whatsoever.\n[Awaiting your orders, Master.]\n[Please command me.]\nSeeing the twenty level 6 golems that had become his subordinates, Lee Shin Woo realized that he was just one step away from actually creating golems.\n[1] T/N: Lee Shin Woo thinks Rem is saying \"steak\", rather than \"stake\" (stake makes more sense, as a stake is a metalworker’s small anvil).\nE/N: Stake Steelworker is another of the 4 commanders under Arema, Guillotine being one of them.",

    "content": "<Chapter 27. New Golem Maker - 7>\n[Stake Steelworker won’t come here himself.]\n[He has commanded us to make use of all our abilities and collect as many emeralds as possible.]\nSilver, like gold, was an ore renowned for its ability to absorb mana. But the way it was used was a bit different; for example, gold was more geared for offensive magic, while silver was used for more practical magic. So the magic that these Silver Golems focused on was...\n\"Subspace, huh. They were trying to clear out the entire mine with just these guys.\"\n[It’s a lower rank subspace than the one I have. It seems to be the limits of the material.]\nRem added. That’s right. The subspace that these Silver Golems possessed was larger than Rem’s own, but in exchange they were much larger. In terms of efficiency, Rem’s was much better.\nIt wasn’t a difference that resulted from pure technical skill. The material that Rem was made of... was an incredibly rare metal; it pissed Lee Shin Woo off, but it would be difficult for him to acquire it right now.\n\"In any case, we’ve gained moving storehouses because of them.\"\n\"These guys were elites that were probably sent after much deliberation...\"\nKratia recollected Jin’s ice breath and smiled bitterly. Of course, she could always do something similar if she used the same type of magic, but it would be difficult for her to gather all the mana in the surrounding area, change it into an element, and shoot it straight forward.\n\"It’s a combination skill. Impressive.\"\n\"...It’s not like that, you know.\"\nWhilst Kratia had fun teasing the embarrassed Jin, Lee Shin Woo acquired all the information he could from the golems, nodded his head, and returned. Of course, he had sent them to the mine so that they would help his other subordinates mine for emeralds.\n\"They definitely have no idea that I’ve cleared out the secret facility. And they probably... wouldn’t expect me to have stolen these Silver Golems as well. How arrogant.\"\nThat was their overconfidence in the Steelworker seal. So long as they remained confident in it, Lee Shin Woo would always have an absolute advantage over them. However...\n\"However, I can’t be complacent.\"\n\"Of course you can’t. If the Silver Golems don’t return for some time, then their superiors might take action, so we have to clear out the mines as soon as possible and leave. However... Hmm.\"\n\"...You’re thinking of something bad, aren’t you?\"\nJin pointed out sharply like a drake’s canine, and Lee Shin Woo flinched.\n\"I was just thinking. When the Steelworkers send golems to a certain area, and we know where they’re sending them, then we could get there before them and acquire more golems like this...\"\n\"You really are a demon.\"\n[If you figure out their departure point, then it will be easy to ascertain their destination. Since it is possible for me to sense a golem’s mana pattern.]\nThen, Rem intervened. Lee Shin Woo had known about Rem’s detection abilities ever since Rem (a level 6 golem) had noticed the golems approaching before even Kratia (a level 7 magician), but it really was amazing.\nFrom what he heard, it was a secondary ability that was a part of Rem’s Mana Parasite skill; Lee Shin Woo just naturally nodded his head. But understanding and astonishment were two different things.\n\"Shin Woo... what kind of monster did you make?\"\n\"My secretary did everything. I know nothing.\"\nKratia, who had been snickering at Lee Shin Woo’s deceit (like always, Jin just remained speechless), suddenly thought of something and nodded her head. Her eyes shined clearly like ice.\n\"If we do well, we may be able to grasp all of the golems’ movements.\"\n\"You say some amazing things like it’s nothing, you know that?\"\n\"There was an item that could make that possible! If Rem is able to use that...!\"\nLee Shin Woo made a look with his goblin fire at Kratia and seemed to ask ’what item, and where is it?’, and Kratia replied vigorously.\n\"The Royal Magician Leader’s training facility. It seems like they left the main area, but there were magic traps set up everywhere, so it was a great place to train my magical ability.\"\nIt seemed like Kratia had reached level 7 in a short period of time, not because she thoughtlessly hunted monsters (of course, she probably did her fair share of that), but because of her experiences in the training facility after following the traces of the Royal Magician Leader. Lee Shin Woo remembered her explaining that she had found a lead on one of the 12 generals, and nodded his head.\n\"There was definitely something like that...\"\n\"It’s still there. It hasn’t been broken through yet, so I’ll go with you, Shin Woo.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"The artifact is there. Let’s go together.\"\n\"Oh... I’m not a magician though.\"\n\"It’ll help you train your other abilities too.\"\nHer explanation just made him feel more anxious, but it didn’t seem like a lie. It seemed like she had wanted to drag him over there right after she helped him take down Hansen, but because he had so much work with the golems and what not, she had pushed it back.\nIt seemed like Lee Shin Woo didn’t have the right to refuse.\n\"Alright, then I suppose we can go together.\"\n\"Hoo.\"\nKratia’s sigh of relief confirmed that she was still hiding something. However, Lee Shin Woo decided not to question her and turned around. He wanted to go through the hardship of getting involved with a general too. There was no reason to doubt her, considering the fact that had grown to level 7.\n\"But right now, we have to make sure the group is safe. One of the 12 general’s troops might be nearby.\"\nWhy would his seniors, who were at least level 6, die? Because they were met with unforeseen danger. Even a level 7 couldn’t relax in a level 3 danger zone, as it was filled with dangerous elements! A hero shouldn’t put their focus into battle; they should be focused on their survival.\n\"Oh, I found a dungeon.\"\n\"Where!?\"\n\"It’s hidden over there. On the edge of the rock cliff with the raging wind.\"\nOf course, that was somewhat meaningless to his party.\nIn the past, he was much weaker than the other heroes, so he had to tread with caution, but now that he’d gained so many abilities and had so many lives, he moved calmly and boldly without being impatient; therefore, there were many cases like right now where he would find a hidden dungeon.\n\"Ah, there really is one. It’s hidden by the naturally formed wind magic. Kuuuuuuu...!\"\n\"The fact that you can keep thinking of Shin Woo as a rival makes me jealous.\"\n\"Let’s first mark that on our minimap... let’s go over here next.\"\nThey had discovered a dungeon, but they didn’t enter it immediately. Since they were still in the middle of reconnaissance. Their first priority? Looking for anything that might approach the mines and endanger their operations!\nFor the next two hours, they scoured the entire area. Ultimately, they faced a few large level 6 and level 7 undead.\n[Guwooooooooooooh!]\n\"Tch, you’re too loud!\"\n\"Be captivated by the Winter Queen’s hands!\"\n[Kuwohk!]\nThey weren’t elite monsters, but when they get to around level 7, they become huge. Even though they weren’t giants, most of them were at least several meters tall.\nBut Lee Shin Woo and Kratia struck a balance between close range and long range, so the monsters weren’t strong enough to be a threat. While Kratia was casting a debuff, Lee Shin Woo approached and cut the monster into pieces with a few powerful strikes.\n[You have acquired 74,150 Perium.]\n[You have acquired the Lv7 Venomous Steel Snake’s fang.]\n[You have acquired the Lv7 Venomous Steel Snake’s leg bone.]\n\"It’s just a normal mob, but it’s still a level 7, so what’s with this Perium?\"\n\"Perium doesn’t increase with level. This guy was really weak.\"\nThat was definitely true. Lee Shin Woo complained and absorbed the fang while he gave the leg bone to Jin. Though it was level 7, his strength only increased by 2, and his health and agility by 1. Jin was quite happy, so he must’ve increased his stats much more.\n\"My strength only increased by 1, but in exchange, my agility increased by 6.\"\n\"Yeah, you must love that Child of Light skill.\"\nNo matter how he thought about it, Jin possessed an imbalanced skill. Lee Shin Woo complained like crazy and collected the Perium.\n\"Let’s go to the dungeon now. Shino Rendu told me that it would take about two more days to completely clear out the mine, so let’s go clear the dungeon and then... Huh?\"\n\"Shin Woo, what’s wrong?\"\nHe knew roughly how to get to the dungeon from where they were. He closed his eyes, called the minimap, and spoke in a doubtful voice. Jin tilted his head and asked what was wrong while Kratia waited for him to continue.\n\"There’s a group of our undead seniors moving together.\"\n\"Can’t you just call them undead heroes?\"\n\"There are about seven or eight of them moving together in a group. That means that...\"\n\"Are they working together?\"\nDoes that mean these undead heroes, who, like Shino Rendu, retained their sense of identity, had created their own clan!? Kratia thought that it was cool in its own way, and Lee Shin Woo retorted.\n\"It’d be great if that were the case, but if we were to logically consider it, the chances of that are low. That’s...\"\nWhy was it? At that moment, Lee Shin Woo recalled Ethan Cruz, who had treated him kindly. What was he trying to do by approaching promising heroes? And what was his ability that had to do with darkness and curses...?\nTo be honest, he had guessed early on. ...But he just didn’t have confirmation.\n\"Let’s go back to the mine. Kratia, is it possible to hide the entire mine? Erasing our presences and making us look like a mountain is plenty.\"\n\"I’ll need your help, but I can manage.\"\n\"Alright. Then let’s go right now.\"\nThey were still quite far away, but they would pass by the mine in a day. They hurried and returned to the mine, and as Lee Shin Woo had requested, Kratia cast a large scale magical formula on top of the mine to disguise it.\nIt was a spell that not only used Lee Shin Woo and Jin’s mana, but also Shino Rendu and the rest of the golems’, and created a huge barrier that hid the existence of the mine. Then, exactly 16 hours after they had returned...\n\"So long as the enemy doesn’t intend to attack first, I can make it so no traces of magic leak out.\"\n\"As expected of a magician.\"\n’It’s a relief that Kratia isn’t our enemy,’ Lee Shin Woo thought and smiled bitterly.\nEven though the Royal Magician Leader had turned into an undead, he would probably wield extraordinary magic, so if he were to fight him, Lee Shin Woo decided that he would make sure that Kratia was in his party.\n\"How is it? Are they coming this way?\"\n\"Fortunately... their objective wasn’t the mine.\"\nAfter Lee Shin Woo had told the Pauls to continue with their work, he looked outside. Though they were physically quite far away, he was level 6; if he were to use his magic to improve his vision, he would be able to see several kilometers away.\nHow many hours did he wait like that? He was finally able to observe the group of undead heroes moving.\n\"...\"\n\"That’s...\"\nJin and Kratia watched from beside him and had their own respective reactions. Lee Shin Woo could understand what they were feeling... at the same time, he was sure that his assumption was correct.\n\"There’s a living person... in the middle of them.\"\n\"Sh... Paul Zero, that means...\"\n\"You’re right.\"\nTo be exact, there were eight high rank undead gathered together, and the man, riding atop a spectral horse... was a cool-looking, middle-aged man with black, curly hair and purple eyes that seemed to suit him. Thɪs chapter is updated by N0veI.Fiɾe.net\nThey felt life energy linger around his cheeks, but they could recognize the black energy that wrapped around the rest of his body even several kilometers away. The dreary and deep energy that would make one shudder felt like a concentrated version of the Empire’s curse.\n\"...Ethan Cruz.\"\nThe words just naturally came out of his mouth, as he confirmed his identity.\n\"He’s a Necromancer.\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 27. New Golem Maker - 8>\nA Necromancer. A magician who raises the dead and controls their bodies. And because the Empire was teeming with the undead, one could say that an individual who could control them was a necromancer as well.\nLee Shin Woo had his suspicions early on, but it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that he himself was also a necromancer. But the way in which he controlled them differed. Rather than using magic, he used a variety of innate skills to control them.\n\"But it... doesn’t feel like he found those undead heroes through luck.\"\n\"...Are you saying that he deliberately killed heroes so that he could make them his subordinates?\"\n\"Maybe.\"\nIf not, then he couldn’t explain why Ethan Cruz had directed him to a special area. He wanted to help him level up quickly? Probably. Since he didn’t want weak undead.\n\"Then can you really call him a hero?\"\n\"I wonder. At the very least, God considers him a hero. For now.\"\n\"...Disgusting. So much so that it makes what you’ve done thus far look cute.\"\n\"Why are you getting me involved?\"\nThey remained on guard and maintained the barrier until they could hide thoroughly from Ethan Cruz and his group of undead heroes. When they were about an hour away with Jin’s running speed, they let go of the barrier.\nThey had noticed their opponent’s advance beforehand, and had completely avoided them, but... even so, Lee Shin Woo couldn’t hide his bitterness.\n’As I thought, I’m still too weak.’\nNo matter how many skeletons had become his subordinates, or the fact that he could now manufacture golems, he still had to put in this much effort just to avoid one person. Even if he took into account that Ethan Cruz was special, it was still quite frustrating.\n’...But this’ll be the last time. It won’t be long before I come for you.’\nLee Shin Woo had discovered Ethan, while Ethan still knew nothing about Lee Shin Woo. This would become a deciding factor in their fight later. Lee Shin Woo was sure of it.\nIn the close future, Ethan Cruz would stand upon his stage. If that happened, he would pay him back for treating him like a chess piece!\n\"It seems like their goal is... Ah, it’s where you died.\"\n[...Me?]\nThey had been so busy maintaining the barrier until now, and Shino Rendu, who was on standby beside them, replied in a truly bitter voice. Until his death, he had respected and followed Ethan Cruz, so Lee Shin Woo could understand how he felt.\n\"Yeah. It seems like he just figured out where you died and came here. ...Hmm, then that means that there’s someone who’s following his orders and scouting around for him.\"\nIf he got the chance, he would catch and extract some information from the scout. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and Shino Rendu was still unable to accept reality, wrapping his large fists around his head.\n[Why would a hero not care about following God’s command...?]\n\"It must be more entertaining that way for him. He’s strange. He looks like he’d be able to easily defeat one or two generals.\"\nThe undead he brought along with him were at least level 6. There were a few level 7s mixed in as well, and Ethan Cruz’s own magic was quite extraordinary. If that’s the case, then he should be able to defeat generals like Hansen... Then why wasn’t he doing that?\n\"Moreover, why does he only use undead heroes? ...Ah, does his necromancy only work on other heroes?\"\n\"It’s likely. Though darkness mana is the power to link the living and the dead together, I’ve heard that if the previous relation is of enemies, then the link won’t work well. However, just by them previously being heroes, their karma is quite similar. It makes sense that the darkness element would work then.\"\nKratia, who would talk at length whenever the subject was on magic, explained and Lee Shin Woo acknowledged her. If that’s the case, then it made sense why Ethan Cruz wasn’t actively hunting the 12 generals.\nHe would continuously wander the Empire, waiting for the heroes to die so that he could make them his subordinates. There was no need for him to hurry and attempt to kill the 12 generals. Rather, they were a precious fighting force that would kill heroes for him.\n[...Are you saying that they’re the reason that I died and became an undead?]\n\"Yeah. In any case, he’s still a hero, no matter what anyone says, and he’s fighting against the Emperor, so when he thinks that his army is ready, he’ll fight against the Emperor. If you look at it that way... you could say that he’s definitely an outstanding hero.\"\n[Everything else about him disgusts me, so I can’t help but laugh.]\nThe goblin fire within Shino Rendu’s eye sockets blazed intensely. He was a special species of undead that fed off feelings of vengeance. With just their conversation about Ethan Cruz, Lee Shin Woo was sure that the next time they met, Shino Rendu would be stronger than before.\nHowever, if Lee Shin Woo were in Ethan Cruz’ shoes, he might’ve done the same thing as him, so he couldn’t say anything more. If there was a more effective way to get stronger, then it was obvious that one would take that approach. But then, Shino Rendu added something surprising.\n[It’s such a relief that I became your subordinate, rather than his.]\n\"What?\"\n[Paul Zero, you accept us as we are. You didn’t lead us; you gave us the will to go where we want to go ourselves.]\n\"...Huh?\"\nWhat the hell is he talking about? He’d only said that to them so he could better control them... While Lee Shin Woo was taken aback, Kratia chipped in from beside him.\n\"You can tell by just looking at the quality of Shin... Paul Zero’s mana.\"\n\"Mm?\"\nShe was talking about Lee Shin Woo’s darkness element. Indeed, Lee Shin Woo was capable of forming contracts with regular undead, undead heroes, golems... or even humans like Kratia through the darkness element, which was definitely different from Ethan Cruz’ application.\nJust by looking at another darkness element user like Ethan Cruz, one would be able to tell that that wasn’t normal.\n\"I feel like your karma’s affecting it too. Since the way in which magic of a similar element is used depends on the individual.\"\n\"...Yeah, you could be right.\"\nIt seemed like the Joker karma was outside the norm in many ways. But it was ultimately because of his Joker karma, not his consideration for others, that caused people to follow him.\nHowever, it would look bad if he were to correct Shino Rendu’s misunderstanding by explaining his wickedness, so he just kept his mouth shut. ...This seemed like something he had thought about just a little while ago.\n\"Then, get back to work. We’ll return to our base once we’ve completely cleared out the mine.\"\n[I understand.]\nThe golems immediately returned to mining. At longest, it should take about another day for them to completely empty the mine. With so many raw materials, he should be able to create golems with the cores he had and still have a lot of materials left over.\n\"Then I have to go to Pleine to sell my wine.\"\n\"Though I wonder how many cores you can make with the money you get from selling the wine.\"\n\"I should be able to make a lot.\"\nKratia spoke, not knowing just how much the Kerr Century Winery’s wine had increased in value, and Lee Shin Woo replied with a grin. Then, he took his party to the dungeon that they had found two days ago and cleared it.\n[Level 6 dungeon - You have acquired a permit to enter the Eagle’s Cliff. All stats are increased by 20 within the dungeon. The dungeon’s information will be added to your minimap. All actions will be buffed within the dungeon.]\nSurprisingly, it was a level 6 dungeon with large, flying monsters. However, by keeping in step with Jin, who turned his hooves into springs, and fiercely swinging his whip around, they were able to safely clear the dungeon.\nThey couldn’t forget about Kratia, who cast a large scale debuff on their enemies, which slowed down all of their movements.\n[Executing Bone Reinforcement on Jin Taylor by consuming the Lv6 Shadow Cliff Eagle’s wing bone. A considerable amount of the effect is shared. Agility has increased by 2, and Magic by 1.]\n[Kyuruuuuuuuuuuuu! Kihiooooooh! - King of Eagle’s Cliff]\n\"How is it? Does it feel like you’ll grow wings?\"\n\"Nope.\"\n\"Tch. As I thought, it had to be a level 7 elite for that...\"\n\"Nope!\"\nAnything between 3,200 and 6,400 stats constituted level 6. In a level 6 dungeon, the dungeon boss would possess stats much greater than the ordinary monsters, yet they would often not reach level 7 and would still be level 6. So it made sense that Bone Reinforcement’s effects were getting weaker!\nBut contrary to Lee Shin Woo, who was disappointed that Jin didn’t sprout wings, Jin looked at him with frigid eyes. It seemed only Kratia was allocated a reward that she actually wanted.\n\"Then let’s go back. It seems like the golems are finished mining.\"\n\"How much did your stats go up, Shin Woo?\"\n\"If I include the stat gains from my ice element and my intermediate elements, my stats increased by 50.\"\n\"...You really are a cheater.\"\nLee Shin Woo thought that they might encounter troops under a general’s command, or another hero on the way back to their hideout, but fortunately, that didn’t happen. Instead, on the way back there was one topic of interest in the chatting channel.\n[Lloyd H.K.: It feels like the high rank undead are on the move more.]\n[Prince Altania: Tch, why now? Lloyd, do we need to group up?]\n[Lloyd H.K.: I’m fine, since I’m with Erian right now. I’m actually worried about you.]\n[Mentes Orun: Those bastards periodically make a huge fuss, so don’t be so worried. The Emperor probably ordered the 12 generals to go on a large-scale patrol.]\n[Ye Jin Jin: Ugh, danger level 2 zones should be fine, right...? Mr. Shin Woo, are you ok?]\n[Lee Shin Woo: No problem as of yet.]\nLee Shin Woo replied as he sweated profusely. It seemed like they hadn’t noticed his unease and went on with their conversation.\n[Ethan Cruz: Even so, their movements are a bit excessive... Would I be overreacting if I were to say I feel like they’re going to war?]\n[Mentes Orun: War...? Who’s fighting who?]\n[Ethan Cruz: I wonder. I don’t know that much. However, you know that there’re several groups that move independently aside from us.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: The 12 generals’ agents are already too much for us, but you’re saying that there’re other groups out there...?]\n[Prince Altania: Heng! Lloyd, wait a bit. I’ll come over after I get to level 7.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Yeah, yeah. You’re really reliable. I trust you.]\n[Seira Von Retadane: ...Everyone, please keep yourselves hidden and do not make any large movements. It isn’t the right time yet.]\n[Prince Altania: You be careful too, Seira. Though I have no idea where you are!]\n[Seira Von Retadane: Please call me Retadane.]\nLee Shin Woo couldn’t take it anymore and exited the chatting channel. Including the questions he wanted to ask Seira, which made his mouth itch, there were many things on his mind right now.\nIt was too clear that Lee Shin Woo was the cause of this ’war’ that Ethan Cruz was talking about. Was his misinformation making the Emperor uneasy right now!? ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ noᴠelfire.net\n\"For the time being, we shouldn’t go to the golem main base.\"\n\"I really like your way of causing trouble for others and then getting out of the situation by yourself.\"\nIt seemed like his misinformation regarding the secret facility that both the Emperor and the golems wanted was in full swing, and causing chaos within the Empire. The reason Lee Shin Woo hadn’t known about any of it was because he had been concentrating on making wine and golems!\n\"In any case, let’s think positively. They can’t just ignore Anti-Skull anymore!\"\n\"How can you be so evil...\"\nLee Shin Woo led his party (including his recently acquired Silver Golems) and safely returned to his base without anyone knowing.\nRegardless of whether or not the Empire’s undead found the golems or Anti-Skull and caused chaos, Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t get himself involved.",

    "content": "<Chapter 27. New Golem Maker - 9>\n[Dark Elemental Bone]\n[A bone gem with all the unnecessary elements removed, and contains the essence of pure darkness mana. It is a never before seen treasure that can contain a much larger quantity of magic than its appearance might suggest.]\n\"Nice. A lot more was removed than I expected, but now I’m done processing the raw materials.\"\n\"The cores are ready too.\"\nLee Shin Woo and Kratia had spent a few days after returning to base processing the materials, and would finally be able to start producing golems.\nLooking back on it, it seemed like it had taken so long to get to this point, but it had actually taken less than a month. He hadn’t been able to hunt much, but there had been so much to do, going from here to there, so it was obvious that it felt like it had been so long.\n\"Pauls, you did well. Form your groups and go out hunting again. Ah, and don’t forget to report if you find a mine.\"\n[Whenever you call us, we will come.] Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn novel★fire.net\nShino Rendu, who had become more dependable than when he was human, said his goodbyes and left with the Pauls. Almost 1,000 troops had left in an instant, so it looked like the base was completely empty, but there were still hundreds of golems left.\n\"You guys go too. You know what to do if you meet a Steelworker, right?\"\n[Only you are our master.]\nHe said his farewells to the golems which had their minds tampered with by Rem. He left behind 10 golems in order to manage the winery and produce the wine. As they continue to do their job, they’ll make big and small mistakes, and eventually become specialists in making wine.\nAh, the Silver Golems were on standby for now.\n[Paul Zero, you’re not done yet?]\n\"Now’s the important part, so just keep watch.\"\n[Ooh, then I’ll come by to play when you’re finished!]\nThe Dryads, who didn’t know that Lee Shin Woo was leaving the winery as soon as he was finished, returned to the vineyard. Lee Shin Woo and Kratia then began to produce golems in earnest.\nThey called it making golems, but they already had everything mapped out, so all they had to do was follow the plans in order and make the golems. Normally, just inserting the raw materials and the core in separate facilities was enough to manufacture a golem, but he needed to try doing it once manually.\n\"Ah, there’s a partial flaw. Kratia, wait a sec.\"\n\"Guu, as I thought, it was a problem with the knee joint... I’ll fix it right away. Wait just a sec.\"\n\"No. Let’s get rid of this and instead, use the magic in the raw materials to fuse it.\"\nDuring the manufacturing process the two engaged in a conversation that Jin couldn’t understand once more. However, he decided that he wouldn’t leave this time. Since he wanted to at least be there when Lee Shin Woo created his first golem.\nFortunately, the errors in their plans weren’t too big, so they could progress without much issue. There used to only be a core at the center of the worktable, but in no time, there was a body attached to it, and then limbs as well, which was quite the spectacle.\n\"Done. The legs are moving.\"\n\"But is the core’s AI ok like this? You don’t need to imprint anything else?\"\n\"We have the darkness mana. Look.\"\nPerhaps because the Dark Elemental Bone’s very birth was affected by Lee Shin Woo, it naturally absorbed Lee Shin Woo’s darkness magic.\nIt looked as though the golem would be fully loyal to Lee Shin Woo before it was even finished... Kratia just sulked a little bit.\n\"But I’m making it with you too.\"\n\"Then come back after you’ve learned how to use darkness magic.\"\n\"Kuuuuu.\"\nFrom the very beginning, Kratia had been interested in manufacturing golems, not taking ownership of them.\nHonestly, in the process of studying the magic applied to golems, she had increased her knowledge of magic theory beyond her imagination, so she did achieve her objective, but...\n\"It feels weird. It’s like the feeling a mother has when her baby, that was born through a joint effort between parents, only follows the father around, rather than the mother.\"\n\"Did you have a kid in your original world...?\"\n\"No, I didn’t! I’m talking about our kid, ours!\"\n\"!?\"\nThe process went smoothly. It felt like it wouldn’t go this smoothly when Arema Steelworker made golems. The speed at which the golem’s magic, which had fused with the darkness magic, circulated incredibly fast, and the connection between the core and its body was quite solid.\n\"It’d probably be hard to use the magic in a different way.\"\n\"It doesn’t have that ability, and it wouldn’t be efficient. Since these are weapons for combat.\"\n\"Then... I think it’s done. Shin Woo, the assembly’s done.\"\nThey’d only started building the golem less than an hour ago, yet there was a 4 meter tall humanoid golem laying atop the worktable.\nThough it was a similar height to the level 5 Iron Golem, its abilities were incomparable. At least in terms of design.\n\"Will it really move...?\"\n\"It’ll definitely move. I’m more worried about whether this thing is a level 6 or not.\"\n\"We used a level 6 core, so it should be. ...The raw materials and the process were perfect, so it could be an elite as well.\"\nHe couldn’t help but shake. Lee Shin Woo had only focused on a singular goal: creating a golem. However, if they actually succeeded in creating a golem, then their status would change in an instant.\nThat’s because he would be able to control hundreds of level 6 elite golems, entities that made even the other heroes nervous.\nLee Shin Woo softly closed and opened his eyes. His heart was pounding, and he wanted to sigh, yet he couldn’t as he didn’t have any respiratory organs. Not having any means of breathing never hurt so much.\n\"Shin Woo. ...Try activating it.\"\n\"...Alright. I’m doing it.\"\nIn the end, he steeled himself and placed his hand atop the core. Of course, the core was protected by an especially durable material, but if Lee Shin Woo were to just let out his magic, it would reach the core immediately. That’s how impressive the mana conductivity of the material was.\n\"Activate.\"\nHe unconsciously spoke a word that was strictly unnecessary, and emitted darkness magic from his fingertips. A skeleton and a golem... normally, these two entities couldn’t easily be linked, but the darkness magic made it almost too natural.\n[Activating...]\nHis powerful will was transmitted along with his magic, and the core seemed to prioritize its absorption; the core, which emitted a gentle light, vibrated like a heart suddenly pounding, and emitted darkness magic everywhere, filling each and every part of the golem’s body.\n[Checking to see if all parts can be activated...]\nThere was an operating ’organ’ located within its brain, and its arms could attack in a variety of ways with magic while its feet had boosters that could increase its speed through magic.\nOnce that process was complete, a gentle green light radiated from the dark green, translucent golem. Despite being an inanimate object, it seemed to give off vigor that it didn’t have before.\n[...Activating.]\nThe golem spoke in a mechanical voice, and simultaneously, the golem’s body bizarrely wriggled. This was the process of the core regulating all of the body’s magic. And eventually, it slowly, very slowly stood up.\n[Recognizing situation...]\nThe golem turned its head slowly and looked around. Because its upper body was 2 meters by itself, it had to look down to see Lee Shin Woo and Kratia. It was so overwhelming that Kratia instinctively grabbed her orb, and Lee Shin Woo kept Rem on standby.\nHowever, that was honestly quite pointless. The moment it had turned its head and seen Lee Shin Woo, it felt like the darkness magic he had released formed a deep link between them... and the golem spoke thusly.\n[Master has been recognized.]\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo heard that, it felt as though the tension had left his body. Kratia staggered and even fell towards Lee Shin Woo, but fortunately, Jin caught her.\n\"...And who am I?\"\nLee Shin Woo tried his very best to not act excited and asked. The golem’s response came immediately.\n[You are my master. Master, please give me a name so you can differentiate me from the others.]\nLee Shin Woo clenched his fists. Kratia just remained vacant and was just waiting for him. In a calm voice, Lee Shin Woo gave him a name.\n\"Rem Two... No, let’s go with Erem.\"\n[Recognized.]\nRegardless of whether it was Rem Two or Erem, his naming sense didn’t involve an ’s’. However, Erem happily accepted its name. ’But was it normal to give golems a name?’, he thought and tilted his head. Then, a message appeared before Lee Shin Woo.\n[You have created the elite Lv6 Dark Emerald Bone Golem, Erem.]\n[You have succeeded in creating a unique golem by stealing techniques from various places. These Dark Emerald Bone Golems, which were created with darkness magic as their foundation, not only possess high strength and can emit powerful magic, but have a high elemental resistance as well. But their greatest strength is their ability to draw in this world’s darkness magic and store it in their bodies. Through that, there is a chance that they can become even stronger.]\n[One problem with these golems however, is that they have no value as commercial products. They will be absolutely loyal to you, as you possess darkness magic.]\n[You have acquired the title, ’Puppet Master’. All stats have increased by 5. The Command skill’s effect is increased, and the power of the darkness element increases slightly.]\nHe had somewhat expected this to happen. How could he not get a title, when he had just created a golem. However, something that he hadn’t expected was added on.\n[Your strength stat has surpassed 1,000! You have acquired the title, ’He Who Dreams of Giants’. Strength has increased by 10. Your body is evolving so that you can exhibit greater strength.]\n\"Huh!?\"\nIt seems as though the five stat bonus from Puppet Master had caused his strength to surpass 1,000 and got him a new title! When his magic had surpassed 1,000, his body had changed as well, so it was happening this time too.\n\"Shin Woo?\"\n\"Wait just a sec.\"\nAlthough it was a title related to his future growth, his body didn’t change dramatically, but his body had certainly gotten stronger so that he could exhibit more of his strength.\nThe feeling of his body being heavier and sharper wasn’t bad. He was wearing armor, so one couldn’t see what was underneath, but Lee Shin Woo could feel the changes.\n’But Kratia told me that you would only get a title like this once.’\nHe remembered clearly. At the time, she said that the first stat (strength, agility, health, or magic) to surpass 1,000 would come with a title, and that title would determine their level 5 ’job’, and the direction of their growth.\nTherefore, he looked back at Kratia, but it looked like she had no idea what was going on... in the end, he decided not to say anything and move on.\n’This is probably due to the Joker karma.’\n\"Well, I just got a title from making the golem. Did you get it too?\"\nLee Shin Woo feigned ignorance and asked. Kratia tilted her head and obediently answered.\n\"Yeah, ’One Who Walks the Path of New Magic’.\"\n\"Nice. I’m sure we succeeded, so shall we finish making all of the golems? From Erem to Erem 277!\"\n\"So you really are going through with that name...\"\nThey had succeeded in making the prototype, so there was no reason to hesitate anymore. Lee Shin Woo and Kratia activated the manufacturing equipment that had been standing by, meticulously scanned Erem, set the fine controls on the equipment, and added the materials.\n\"The initial activation will require my mana, so it’s still a problem that I have to put my hand atop each and every one of them...\"\n\"Shin Woo, I’m activating it!\"\n\"Yeah, go ahead!\"\n\"Roger!\"\nKratia’s eyes shined and activated the manufacturing process for all the equipment. The Dark Emerald Bones and the cores that were piled together like a mountain were placed into the devices one by one, radiated a blinding light here and there, and began the fusion to form the golems. Lee Shin Woo was anticipating the moment that Erem Two was finished and gathered his darkness mana.\nUnfortunately, no one knew that Lee Shin Woo was making an army that could threaten a part of the Empire.",

    "content": "<Chapter 28. Kratia’s Quest - 1>\nThey had made one mistake in creating golems. Measuring out the materials that they would need for the golems’ bodies.\nHe had originally thought that the emeralds that they’d mined would be enough to create all 277 golems, but because of the transformation, the Dark Emerald Bone was slightly reduced in size. Plus, in the process of slightly carving the bone, as well as combining them, there was some bone loss, so he ultimately ran out of raw materials when building Erem 250.\n[Master, please command me.]\n[Erem 178 is here.]\n\"This...\"\nLee Shin Woo moved on from the 250th Erem and looked futilely at the pile of dense, dark green powder... that resulted from carving the Dark Emerald Bones. He didn’t have enough raw materials to make the next 20 or so Erems but had more than enough powder.\n\"I guess it can’t be helped. I suppose I’ll have to use this for my Bone Gate or for regenerating.\"\n\"They’re much too valuable to use for that... Give me half. I feel like I’ll be able to use it for some special magic. If not, then maybe I can use it to make an artifact.\"\n\"You make artifacts?\"\n\"Haa. It’s actually a specialty of mine.\"\n\"Yeah, alright. I’ll give you some.\"\nLee Shin Woo didn’t have the time to listen to her boasts, so he obediently gave her half the gemstone bone powder. When he considered her contributions in making the golems, this was nothing.\n\"Now what are you going to do with the golems?\"\n\"They’re like the other golems. I’ll split them into a few groups and send them off to hunt.\"\nKratia gaped at Lee Shin Woo, who had created 250 level 6 elite golems. It might make sense if he were to send them after one of the 12 generals, but why would he split them up!?\n\"You’re just going to send these guys off to hunt?\"\n\"Then what, do you want me to just leave them to rot?\"\n\"No, but...\"\nEven while flustered, Kratia gave her opinion. Telling him that the vibe in the Empire was becoming increasingly uneasy, that the Emperor’s undead were probably gritting their teeth at the golems, and that it would be dangerous to send the golems out right now.\nEverything she said was correct, and her interferences were correct as well. However, Lee Shin Woo was the one who originally told her all that. He just told her that they would have to take that risk.\n\"Yeah, it’s dangerous, but sending something away from my grasp will always be dangerous. But Kratia, you have to invest for that capital to grow. And the more danger there is, the more there is to gain.\"\n\"Capital...\"\nIt frustrated her, but he was right. That same principle applied to them: heroes couldn’t grow if they didn’t endure danger. Kratia acquiesced to his logic, and Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly.\n\"Well, I don’t really like investing in a loss. I made this decision after considering our chances of winning, so just watch.\"\nLee Shin Woo created ten groups of 21, consisting of... 20 Dark Emerald Bone Golems, and 1 Silver Golem. The Silver Golems were a precious resource, as they possessed a moving warehouse.\n\"You’ve probably already heard, but you don’t need to fight against opponents that are much too strong for you. If you find troops under the Steelworker’s, or any of the 12 generals’ command, don’t fight and report to me at once. If you cannot win and you’re about to be destroyed, sending me that information is paramount.\"\n[I understand, Master.]\nA group of 21 level 6 elite golems would be able to tread through a level 3 danger zone without being on the receiving end. Moreover, even if they were discovered by heroes, the heroes wouldn’t attack easily, as they would be on guard against them.\n\"Oh, and never go over here.\"\n[I’ll keep that in mind.]\nOnce he told them to go in the opposite direction of Ethan Cruz, they all dispersed.\nThe Silver Golem not only possessed the subspace ability but could also move stealthily, so they should be able to teach the Erems the fundamentals of moving stealthily while leading them. He didn’t send the Silver Golems along with them just for their subspace ability.\n\"You sent that many away, yet you still have 60 level 6 golems left...\"\n\"Alright, then you guys will...\"\nThere were 10 Silver Golems and 50 Erems left. These guys would patrol inside and outside the base and would be on standby, in case they were needed as emergency reinforcements. Even a level 7 elite would have difficulties getting through them.\n\"Then Shin Woo, what are you going to do with the remaining cores? Are you going to make more golems after you procure the materials?\"\n\"Nope. Let’s just leave them be for now.\"\nHe had said that he would sell the wine to the secret shop and buy materials to make cores if he had any materials remaining; yet he didn’t have any materials remaining nor could he absorb the cores. Lee Shin Woo was sure that it wouldn’t be a good idea to scrape by by buying the materials he was lacking from the secret shop to make the remaining golems.\n\"In any case, I can always make golems whenever I want. I’ll think about making more golems when I get my hands on some materials.\"\nIn other words, the Solar Fossil. He thought about making golems with this unique and precious treasure, but Lee Shin Woo and Kratia didn’t have the knowledge to make golems using the Solar Fossil. When he thought about that, he calmed down a bit. He still needed to work hard.\n\"And you never know, there might be a way to further strengthen these Original Cores.\"\n\"I can’t even imagine that, but... In any case, if we go there, it might help improve your knowledge of magic, Shin Woo.\"\n\"You’re talking about that magic training facility, right?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nIt seemed like she really wanted to bring him over there. Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly, nodded his head, and spoke. He’d fermented the wine and made the golems as well. He supposed he could follow her now.\nLee Shin Woo looked around the base one more time and prepared to leave. He didn’t know how they knew, but the moment he was about to leave, the Dryads came out. Once he finished with his goodbyes, he left their base.\n\"Where do we have to go?\"\n\"Mm, this way.\"\nKratia shared her minimap with Lee Shin Woo and pointed towards a specific spot. Coincidentally, their destination was in the opposite direction, but if they took the golem train and departed from where it stopped, they would be able to reach it rather quickly.\n\"Then are we going to take the train?\"\n\"No. Not only are you with us right now... we also have to avoid the golems for the time being. But it’s not like there’s no way of getting there.\"\nLee Shin Woo smiled (of course, from an outside view, it just looked like his jawbone moved downwards a little bit) elatedly at Kratia, who was tilting her head and took out a precious item from his inventory. It was the level 8 Bone Gate!\n[Bone Gate]\n[Lv8]\n[Durability - 1,550/1,550]\n[A treasure that sacrifices bone to create a gate that leads to a designated point. The gate can only be linked to a location that the user is completely familiar with, and it is impossible to cross dimensions. It is imperfect, so the amount of people who can utilize the gate is very limited.]\nFrom the outside, the Bone Gate just looked like an oval-shaped bone bracelet. But Kratia’s eyes shined, as she could grasp a portion of the magic within, and asked.\n\"This is the Bone Gate?\"\n\"This is my first time using it.\"\nThe reason he had suggested that they not use the golem train was because he wanted to use the Bone Gate. Lee Shin Woo looked at the Bone Gate with severe anticipation and gripped it.\nWas it because it was an item that was made of bone? He knew how to use it instinctually. Lee Shin Woo needed to focus on the image he wanted to go to and then infuse his mana into the Bone Gate!\n[Giiiiiiiiiiiii]\nThe Bone Gate accepted his magic and he like felt it demanded a bone prior to activation. Because it felt like it would eat away at his hand if he let it be, he hurriedly opened his inventory and fed it the bone powder created from grinding level 1 and 2 bones.\n[Giiiiii]\n\"Damn, how long are you going to keep eating... Huh?\"\nThe Bone Gate stuffed itself for quite a while, perhaps because the quality of bone was so low, and let out a bizarre sound as if it was saying ’give me more’. If the bone powder wasn’t enough this time too, then Lee Shin Woo was ready to sacrifice the gemstone bone powder, but then, it suddenly began to emit a white light!\nHe was taken aback. When he lifted the Bone Gate, the radiating light formed a giant oval shape. It looked like around two people could easily fit through it.\n\"This is gate magic... It’s ridiculously high rank magic. Even if it’s a temporary gate, the level of magic is similar.\"\nKratia gaped and verbalized her astonishment. It seems as though she’d seen this kind of magic before.\n\"Alright, then shall we?\"\n\"Wait a sec, Shin Woo. It seems like only two people can go through.\"\n\"What...\"\nIt’d eaten that much bone powder and it would only let two people through!? But if they did nothing, then the gate would close on them and no one would be able to get through.\nLee Shin Woo gritted his teeth and sent Kratia and Rem through the gate first. As he thought, Rem was considered a ’person’ as the gate became faint and vanished. Immediately after, Kratia sent him a message.\n[Kratia Melloi: I arrived. It’s awesome!]\n\"Yeah, I’m glad you think so.\"\nHe weakly replied and fed the Bone Gate bone powder again. Although he had collected a large quantity of bone powder from the few large battles he’d been in, as well as the bones that the Pauls and golems had brought him, opening the gate twice had consumed 25% of his bone powder!\n’I should probably just use high level bones instead... No, no I shouldn’t. I can always get my hands on low level bones. Damn it. In any case, I need to find a solution soon.’\nLee Shin Woo gritted his teeth and at the same time, entered through the gate with Jin. Rem, who was waiting for them from beyond the gate, flew and perched itself on his shoulder, while Kratia rushed over to them, looking incredibly excited.\n\"A gate! Amazing! The Bone Gate’s amazing!\"\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"\nWhy is it that Kratia’s personality does a 180 whenever magic is involved? Lee Shin Woo replied roughly and when he was about to put the Bone Gate into his inventory, Kratia suddenly spoke.\n\"If you absorb that, can’t you use that ability, Shin Woo?\"\n\"Ah...\"\n\"You can’t?\"\n\"No, well, you’re probably right.\"\n\"Then!\"\n\"But...\"\nThere was no way Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t have thought of that. Moreover, Kratia probably wasn’t aware of this, but he possessed the Bone Armory ability. If he succeeded in absorbing the Bone Gate, he would be able to reproduce its effects without fail. If he was sure he could absorb it, he wouldn’t hesitate. Yeah, if he could that is.\n[You cannot absorb the Bone Gate through Bone Reinforcement. The level of Bone Reinforcement, Bone Armory, as well as your own level is much too low in comparison to Bone Gate.]\n\"Ah...\"\n\"Don’t look at me with such disappointment.\"\nHe placed the Bone Gate into his inventory, and Kratia rode behind him. He couldn’t thank Jin enough for allowing both him and Kratia to ride him.\n\"You just need to go this way. Let’s hurry.\"\n\"Roger.\"\n\"Wait a sec, you’re too fas... Uweeehk.\"\n\"You can vomit if you want, but just don’t vomit on my back.\"\nJin’s speed increased day by day. If he felt like he’d barely adapted to his speed, then Jin would get faster the next day. The scary part was that even though Jin had two people riding him, plus a golem, he didn’t seem to run any slower; instead, he seemed to gradually pick up speed.\n\"We should arrive within 5 minutes at this speed. So Kratia, how do we get in? It should have a secret code like our winery.\"\n\"It does. We can’t just go in like this... Uweeehk.\"\nThe effect of his sprint was amazing! Kratia was completely nauseated!\nBecause Kratia was the only one with a permit, Jin had no choice but to slow down. Kratia slapped Jin’s ass a few times (since he was garbed in steel armor, Kratia’s hand was the only thing hurting), and after barely calming down, she checked her surroundings. She then ordered.\n\"Go a little more forward. Slowly!\"\n\"You can’t even get used to that speed?\"\n\"You’re just too fast, Jin!\"\nAfter five minutes of detailed adjustments, they barely arrived at the entrance to the training facility. While they did arrive, it was just an empty plain.\n\"It’s not inside of a city or a dungeon, so where...\"\n\"Ah, I found it.\" ᴛhis chapter is ᴜpdated by NoveI-Fire.ɴet\n\"Yeah, I thought you would say that about now, Shin Woo.\"\nThough he said there wasn’t a dungeon around, its system was exactly like one. How did they hide a subspace? It wouldn’t be wrong to say it was a type of dungeon, but its size, as well as the concentration of magic, was incomparable to a normal dungeon.\n\"But it’s all oddly concealed, right? This is the Royal Magician Leader’s ability.\"\n\"That means that there’s no way I can fight him... Then can we really just relax and go on in?\"\n\"If you don’t invest capital, then it won’t grow. The more danger there is, the more there is to...\"\n\"Ah, fine. I got it.\"\nAt least in terms of enthusiasm for magic, Kratia had him beat. Well, if things went bad, they could just get on Jin and run, so it wasn’t that big of a deal.\nHowever, the moment they decided to enter the training facility...\n[Welcome, new trainees. There are a total of five trainees, including the other trainees.]\n\"...Five?\"\n\"Shin Woo!\"\nLee Shin Woo’s goblin fire twisted at the mechanical sound that surrounded them, and the moment that Kratia yelled...\n\"Who are you!?\"\n\"Keut.\"\nSomeone appeared before them. He had lustrous, lively silver hair, pale skin, and rosy cheeks that shined a bit more than Pleine’s...\n\"Who are you, and how did you get in here!? This is a place that I, Prince Altania, have conquered! Hey you, take off your helmet!\"\nA rude magician boy pointed his antique wooden staff at them and yelled.\nHe had met the one senior he really didn’t want to meet.",

    "content": "<Chapter 28. Kratia’s Quest - 2>\n\"A human? You’re a living human being?\" Read complete versıon only at noⅴelfire.net\n\"Yeah, I’m human. Human.\"\nKratia hurriedly nodded her head while replying stutteringly. But it was clear that she was flustered, and her acting wasn’t good enough to hide Lee Shin Woo’s identity. As proof, Prince Altania quickly pointed his staff at Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Then what about you...? Are you an undead? I only felt it for a moment, but I definitely felt powerful death energy. Don’t try to fool me. If you’re caught by the genius magician, Prince Altania, then even a general would fall in one hit!\"\n\"...There’s no way I’d be able to fool you, Senior.\"\n\"...Huh?\"\nLee Shin Woo’s voice, which flowed out from his helmet, caused Prince to flinch. Once Lee Shin Woo took off his helmet and revealed himself, Prince Altania froze. Kratia, who unintentionally looked back, froze as well. At some point, Rem had disappeared from his shoulder, but that wasn’t really very important right now.\n\"...Lee Shin Woo?\"\n\"It’s a pleasure, Senior. That’s right. It’s me, Lee Shin Woo.\"\nLee Shin Woo replied with a refreshing smile. Prince Altania was temporarily unable to respond and remained stiff, but he soon cleared his throat and withdrew his staff.\n\"It’s strange. It was just for a moment, but I definitely felt death energy.\"\n\"I believe it might be due to the energy flowing from the gate, as we opened and entered it.\"\n\"That’s... I assumed as much! I was just on guard because you were wearing that weird armor of yours! You got it?\"\n\"Ah, you truly are a hero. As expected of you, Senior.\"\nThe boy’s cheeks flushed, and he attempted to put up a strong front to hide his embarrassment. Lee Shin Woo smiled gently, and agreed enthusiastically. He was even able to sweet talk a general, so Prince Altania quickly moved on.\n\"You’re not bad. I’ll recognize you as my junior. ...Ah, then who’s that woman over there?\"\n\"This is Kratia Melloi. I met her a short while ago, and we’ve gotten quite close. It seems like she’s still wary of you (seniors).\"\n\"Yeah, Kratia Melloi...\"\nShe confirmed his statement by nodding her head, yet she was still unable to hide her anxiousness.\nKratia kept glancing at Lee Shin Woo in disbelief, and fortunately, Prince took that as her being shy. He nodded his head, made a sudden sound, and furrowed his brows.\n\"Kratia Melloi... Wait a sec, you’re the one who went into the channel and then left right away? The one who met with Lloyd a little while ago?\"\n\"Uh, yeah.\"\n\"The one Lloyd said was stronger than him... Keut, you said you were a magician, right? Let’s spar!\"\nOnce Kratia nodded her head, Prince raised his staff once more. However, Kratia didn’t give him the time of day. She was completely busy glancing at Lee Shin Woo.\nLee Shin Woo could understand how she felt, but it was becoming troublesome, so he re-equipped his helmet, covering his face. Only then did Kratia get a hold of herself, gasped, and slapped her cheek. Her once pale cheeks soon turned red. Jin sighed and spoke with Lee Shin Woo through their connection.\n’How did you disguise yourself so quickly?’\n’That’s what it means to be a pro.’\nThat’s right. The moment someone outside of their party noticed them, he had immediately activated Disguise. The reason that Prince Altania just moved on, and Kratia was so astonished was because of his disguise.\nIt had only taken 0.01 seconds to change into his human appearance back on Earth with his level 6 Disguise skill! It was so fast that even if he were to disguise himself right in front of someone, they would think they were seeing things and let it go.\n\"Hey, I said let’s spar!\"\n\"...Huh?\"\nKratia finally turned her attention away from Lee Shin Woo and towards Prince Altania. She noticed that Prince was pointing his magic staff straight at her, but she didn’t really react.\n\"Why?\"\n\"Why, why... That’s right! In a joint operation with a magician you’ve met for the first time, you’re supposed to spar so that you can assess each other’s abilities. You didn’t know?\"\n\"A joint operation...?\"\nIt seemed like his ’joint operation’ was referring to challenging this training facility... Kratia couldn’t understand what he was talking about, and tilted her head. As a rational magician, she couldn’t understand Prince’s actions.\n\"Whatever, c’mon. Ah, and if you lose, don’t go near Lloyd ever again!\"\n\"I don’t like wasting my energy. I’d rather focus on the traps here. And I’m not interested in this Lloyd guy whatsoever.\"\n\"Urgh... If you’re not going to attack, then I will!\"\nKratia furrowed her brows at Prince’s persistence, and the moment she responded, an overwhelming amount of flames erupted from his staff!\nLee Shin Woo didn’t think Prince Altania would actually attack another hero, and just gaped while watching on the side. He’d gotten that vibe from him in the chatting channel, but he really was an idiot!\n\"...Hoo.\"\nDespite the wave of flames that threatened to swallow her whole, Kratia sighed and waved her hand.\nOnce the orb (it was a lot smaller than last time), which was stuck to the back of her hand, shined and soared into the air, Prince muttered something, as if to stop her from casting a defensive spell, and cast another spell, but...\n\"Freeze.\"\nWith one word, everything froze.\n\"...Woah.\"\nIn an instant, the area had become silent. The flames, the new flow of mana that the Prince had created, and even Prince Altania himself were frozen.\nLee Shin Woo ended up clapping, as he saw her do something so ridiculous, yet she retrieved her orb with a single gentle hand movement without breaking a sweat.\n\"He’s not dead though, right?\"\n\"He has magic, so he won’t die. I held back.\"\n\"Yeah, so you did hold back, huh...\"\nOnce Kratia softly waved her hand, the frozen flames completely vanished. Then, the mana that had formed in the air vanished as well. And lastly, the frozen Prince was thrown out of the subspace.\nLee Shin Woo offered up a silent prayer for him, and Kratia tilted her head and briefly spoke her mind.\n\"He was weird.\"\n\"Well, I feel like I can understand where he’s coming from...\"\n\"You can understand him!?\"\nJin, rather than Kratia, was shocked and yelled. It made sense that he would point his staff at them since he had thought they were undead, but for Lee Shin Woo to understand him, when he had attacked another hero with a shitty reason like assessing her abilities!?\nWhen did Lee Shin Woo become such a saint!? However, Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and explained.\n\"We were given all the clues. Like the magician that Lloyd said was stronger. In other words, Prince was pissed that Lloyd thought of Kratia so highly.\"\n\"Why would he get pissed over that...?\"\n\"Because Lloyd would want Kratia more supposedly.\"\n\"??\"\nKratia and Jin both looked confused. He was positive that they still didn’t understand how what he was saying was related to the situation at all.\nLee Shin Woo thought about how he could explain the pride of a person with a large ego, or Prince and Lloyd’s strange relationship that he’d observed a few times in the chatting channel, but he quickly gave up and went with the easiest way of explaining it.\n\"Prince likes Lloyd. He’s jealous of Kratia since Lloyd thinks so highly of her. They’re both magicians, so it must’ve been even worse for him.\"\n\"He’s a guy, though!? But I suppose a man can like another man!\"\n\"Yeah, I agree, but that’s not the case here. Prince is a girl.\"\n\"!?\"\n\"!?\"\nThe effect was tremendous! Jin and Kratia were confused!\nBut this time, Lee Shin Woo was speechless seeing their faces.\n\"How can you not know? That beautiful outer appearance, the way she puts up a strong front, yet the delicate gestures... And the deciding factor was the fact that there’re traces of mana around her body that indicate that she’s using a disguise type magic.\"\n\"...Now that you mention it, it all makes sense.\"\n\"Plus, the name Prince is clearly being used to show her ’masculinity’. In cases like this, there’s a high chance that she’s actually the opposite gender.\"\nThey ruminated over Prince’s appearance. It was exactly as Lee Shin Woo said. When they thought about it like that, they felt like it was weird that they had actually thought of her as a guy.\n\"It’s hard to hide your gender. Prince is the type who thinks that as long as she hides what she looks like on the outside and changes her voice, then she’ll be ok. That’s why she gets caught so easily.\"\n\"That’s true, but it really pisses me off to hear it from you...!\"\n\"Agreed...!\"\n\"Huh?\"\nWhy? He thought he’d explained it quite amicably, yet Jin and Kratia gazed at Lee Shin Woo as if they were letdown! Lee Shin Woo couldn’t bear their anger, especially since he didn’t know why they were mad at him in the first place and turned his gaze. Then, Kratia suddenly grabbed him.\n\"By the way, what’s with that face from before?\"\n\"Ah, that’s my face from when I was still on Earth. Though my Disguise skill has leveled up, I can only disguise myself this much for now.\"\n\"Disguise? That’s a disguise? How’s that even possible?\"\n\"Even I’m not sure how it works, so why don’t you ask God later?\"\nKratia grabbed onto Lee Shin Woo even tighter. Her eyes were filled with excitement.\n\"Show me one more time.\"\n\"We came here to go through the training facility, not research my Disguise skill, right?\"\n\"Just once.\"\n\"Hoo.\"\nLee Shin Woo sighed and took off his helmet. Kratia exclaimed with a ’ooh’, approached him, and rubbed his cheek. That fresh feeling and the heat that was unmistakably human caused her to blush slightly. Lee Shin Woo looked down at her and spoke to her with a bit of a chilled voice.\n\"That’s not what I look like right now. It’s just a disguise.\"\n\"Then is your true appearance that of a bony skeleton?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Who determines what’s fake and what’s real?\"\nHe could easily say that his disguised appearance was fake. However, his Joker karma stopped him. Since there was no one who recognized him as a fake. Kratia nodded her head as though she understood how he felt and continued.\n\"One day the boundary between what’s fake and what’s real will come crashing down. You’ll have to think hard when that time comes, Shin Woo.\"\nKratia’s words left a deep impression on Lee Shin Woo. If Lee Shin Woo were able to make a perfect fake, fool everyone, fool himself, and even fool the entire world... could he really call that a fake?\nHe believed that when he could answer that question clearly, he would become a true Joker.\n\"You really are a magician.\"\n\"That’s the ultimate goal of a magician. Deceiving the world and creating what’s real.\"\n\"I told you, I’m not a magician.\"\n\"Kratia, you’re getting way too close.\"\nJin gently pushed Kratia away, who had been continuously rubbing Lee Shin Woo’s cheek. At the same time, the barrier opened and someone entered the training facility. It was obviously the Prince.\n\"Y-Yooooooooou!\"\nPrince aimed her staff at Kratia while water melted and dripped from the ends of her trembling hair. Lee Shin Woo thought she’d be frozen for a few hours, but it seems like she didn’t completely lack in the talent department. He was secretly impressed.\n\"...I won’t go easy on you this time.\"\n\"Kuuuuuuu....!\"\nThe orb floated into the air and violently rotated, drawing in the surrounding mana and creating ice crystals. Seeing that, Prince recoiled, but soon grit her teeth and spoke.\n\"Joint operation!\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I... I’ve seen what you can do, so we should clear it together!\"\nLee Shin Woo saw Prince’s cheeks get so red that he thought they would explode and erupted in laughter.",

    "content": "<Chapter 28. Kratia’s Quest - 3>\nPrince recognized the fact that she was weaker than Kratia, and it seemed like the situation was somehow resolved... but unfortunately, the situation didn’t progress so smoothly.\nThe joint operation... she hadn’t even asked Lee Shin Woo’s group to work together with her, yet she insisted that, as heroes, they had to clear the training facility together.\n\"We’re going to the next level. Train by yourself. I don’t like you.\"\n\"The next level? Don’t lie. You came here before me? You came to the Empire a lot later than me, so how!?\"\n\"I can prove it to you.\"\n\"Keuk, that’s a seal of completion... How!?\"\nLee Shin Woo let Kratia and Prince bicker, and went to explore the facility alone... No, he and Jin moved secretly and explored with Rem. There were two things that was surprising about this facility. One, it was huge, and two, mana was filling it to the brim.\n[It looks like they used golem techniques as well. It cannot carry out specific commands, but a simple core was inserted that can carry out simple repetitive commands.]\n\"Looks that way. ...That looks like you could use it to train knights, too.\"\nThere was a corner of the facility that made him think of an amusement park. Starting from the entrance, he followed the guide through the facility and would go from one building-shaped training ground to another.\nThe difference between it and an amusement park was that there was a specific order one had to go through. And...\n\"It seems like there’s no safety equipment...\"\n\"I’ll get scared, so don’t say stuff like that.\"\n\"But Kratia’s right. It’ll definitely help in controlling mana.\"\nLee Shin Woo secretly glanced back. Kratia and Prince looked like they were still arguing, so he left them behind and entered the first facility. Then, he heard a mechanical sounding voice in his ear. It was a similar sound to that of a golem activating.\n[Beginning first training exercise. Testing how quickly the user can gather their mana.]\n[Three participants in the training exercise. Beginning training exercise. Please gather enough mana to use intermediate magic at minimum.]\n\"Aha, so they do start with the fundamentals after all.\"\n\"Huh? I have to do this too.\"\n[Master, if you give me the order, I will destroy the facility’s central hub. Probability of success: 80%.]\n\"For now, just do as it says.\"\n[I understand.]\nIf it just wanted him to gather his mana into one spot, then he could’ve done this when he was level 1, but by adding the intermediate magic stipulation, they were probably testing how fast one could gather their mana, as well as one’s maximum capacity. To be honest, it wasn’t all that difficult, so he did it immediately.\n[Beginning second training exercise. Testing ability to infuse mana, as well as how much is lost during the transfer.]\n[Three participants in the training exercise. Beginning training exercise. Please infuse mana into the rock falling from above and stop it.]\n\"Huh?\"\nThe message ended and at the same time, a giant rock suddenly fell from above their heads! Jin was taken aback, but Lee Shin Woo fired out mana that was accumulated in his hand and concentrated it into the rock. In addition, he used his connection with Jin to transfer the mana Jin had gathered to the rock as well.\nRem could control mana well, as it possessed the Mana Parasite ability, and was easily able to infuse its mana into the rock. The moment the three’s mana was completely infused, the once falling rock stopped in place. It was set up so that if an adequate amount of mana was infused, then the rock would stop falling.\n\"There’s a limit to how inhospitable you can be; they’re trying to kills us!\"\n\"Get a hold of yourself, Jin. You won’t die if you get hit by a rock like this anymore.\"\n\"...Ah, you’re right.\"\n[Passed. Beginning third training exercise. Testing rapid concentration and multiple infusions of mana.]\n[Three participants in the training exercise. Beginning training exercise. Please infuse a sufficient amount of mana into each and every rock that comes flying in every direction.]\nThe third training exercise was even more ridiculous. There were cannons that seemed to spring out from everywhere within the vast facility; they aimed for Lee Shin Woo’s party and sharp rocks were shot at them from every direction!\nMoreover, their mission objective was not to destroy or evade the rocks, but to infuse an adequate amount of mana into them to stop them! Jin was astonished once more, but Lee Shin Woo immediately progressed with the mission. To be honest, this was nothing compared to the complexity of making the Steelworker seal.\n’All I have to do is calculate how much mana they need before they stop, and divide my mana and infuse it into them.’\nThe amount of mana he needed to use to stop each rock was identical. But before the rocks came close, he would have to sense them, fire his mana at a long-range, and infuse it into them, which was a bit complex. However, Lee Shin Woo was capable of this level of mana control when he was level 3, so he was able to do it easily.\nBut Jin was the problem.\n\"Hey! Why aren’t you stopping the ones coming at me! Hey!\"\n\"You have to practice too. It may look like it doesn’t apply to you, but if you become able to control mana in a multitude of ways, then all of your abilities will get stronger.\"\nLee Shin Woo said provokingly as he shot out his mana everywhere and accurately hit the rocks.\nAfter that, Jin was struck by quite a few more rocks (it didn’t hurt much since he was covered in steel armor, but he felt quite bad) and gritted his teeth, then tried his best to imitate Lee Shin Woo. Of course, it wasn’t that easy.\n\"No, not that way. You have to control it a bit more thoroughly. It seems like they won’t stop if you infuse too much mana.\"\n\"How is this even possible!?\"\nBut after continuously getting hit by the rocks, Jin concentrated more on his magic control, even if he was doing it out of anger. After 7 minutes of being struck by the barrage of rocks, he finally succeeded in infusing the right amount of mana into a rock! At that very moment, the rocks that had once been flying at them vanished.\n[Ending training exercise. Passed: 2, Failed: 1.]\n[Would you like to kick out the failure and continue with the next training exercise? Or would you like to retrain with the failure?]\n\"This guy is doing this on purpose, isn’t he!? He ended it here on purpose, didn’t he!?\"\n\"Calm down. If you get too excited, then you’ll forget what it felt like!\"\n\"I don’t care. I’ll just destroy it all!\"\nRight when Jin was about to destroy the facility with his mouth cannon, the training was suspended and Kratia walked onto the premises. Prince was with her, though it looked like she still didn’t understand what was going on.\n\"Shin Woo, we don’t have time to waste on the basic training facility.\"\n\"Yeah, if you want to assess this frustrating kid’s ability, then you have to go further in.\"\n\"So wait, you decided to work together?\"\n\"So long as they follow us and don’t say anything.\"\n\"Keuk.\"\n\"Oh...\"\nIt seemed as though an individual who had previously passed the training exercises can skip those facilities; it looked like companions could go with them as well. Hearing that, Lee Shin Woo thought briefly and got down from Jin’s back.\n’You’re going to follow them!?’\n’I trust you. Plus, you need this training. Well, see you later.’\n’Hey...!’\nJin was so surprised that he leap up, but Lee Shin Woo just grinned and patted him. Once Prince entered, Rem went into stealth mode and hid itself. Lee Shin Woo placed Rem atop Jin’s back so that it wouldn’t be noticed.\n’Rem, just make sure this guy doesn’t die.’\n’I understand.’\nKratia, who had been watching that interaction, noticed that Rem went into stealth mode, but didn’t say anything. That was because she realized that Lee Shin Woo was trying to hide a few facts that stemmed from him being a skeleton.\nBut unrelated to that, Kratia was slightly disappointed in Prince, as she didn’t notice Rem going into stealth mode. To be honest, it was only possible because Lee Shin Woo had added in his Assimilation and Disguise skills. If one couldn’t grasp Rem’s original mana, then it would fool anyone.\n\"A horse will just get in the way of your training. ...But if you just leave it like that, it won’t leave?\"\n\"He’s extremely smart, so it’ll be fine.\"\n\"Then again, it does seem quite impressive for a horse that you got in the Empire... It’s just like that elf said.\"\n\"Now, let’s go forward. Kratia, you lead.\"\nWhen Prince saw Jin, who was wearing steel armor, she briefly admired him, but other than that, she paid him no mind. Of course, Lee Shin Woo had slightly used his ability here as well. He had succeeded in completely tearing her attention away from Jin and Rem.\n\"The further we go, the more complex it becomes. There are also sections that require combat.\"\n\"Combat?\"\n\"Since this is a dungeon. Monsters are led and restrained through magic.\"\n\"Ah, as expected.\"\nLee Shin Woo then understood. Regardless of how amazing the Royal Magician Leader was, he wouldn’t have been able to create this large of a subspace in a place that had nothing there. In other words, he had created this facility by using pre-existing dungeons.\n\"Though it is amazing that he tied together several dungeons into one.\"\n\"That’s not something a human being can do...\"\nWhile they talked, the group used Kratia’s free pass to get through the various facilities.\nAs he passed through, Lee Shin Woo saw the hidden, bloodied iron maces hidden here and there, the thorn floor, the spears that were set up in the ceiling that threatened to fall, as well as the areas that were completely destroyed and rebuilt into the facilities with magic, etc... and he couldn’t figure whether the Royal Magician Leader wanted to train magicians or to bury them.\n\"This facility also has a system that measures the level of magic, and whether one can use magic or not. It’s not an ability inherent to the dungeon, so it’s definitely an artifact. I was sure after I retraced the mana.\"\n\"R-Retraced?\"\nPrince’s eyes shook. Yeah, Lee Shin Woo had roughly expected that she wouldn’t know anything.\n\"We came here to clear all of the training exercises and take that. Don’t touch it.\"\n\"But as a fellow hero, I should...\"\n\"You agreed to follow us and not say anything.\"\n\"Keuk...!\"\n\"But if you want the artifact, you can compete with us. Though it would be 2 on 1.\" Thɪs chapter is updatᴇd by n͟o͟v͟e͟l͟f͟i͟r͟e͟.net\nKratia dragged one of Lee Shin Woo’s arms towards her and hugged it, and laughed at Prince. After she had figured out that Prince was a girl, Kratia’s way of teasing her had changed. It seemed like her teasing was quite effective.\n\"I wouldn’t need your help if Lloyd was here...!\"\n\"If you needed help, you should’ve brought him.\"\n\"But I couldn’t stand the sight him enjoying that elf sticking to him, so I... Hey, why am I telling you this!? It’s fine, you can take it all! All I need is an increase in my magical abilities!\"\nLee Shin Woo watched as Prince got caught up in Kratia’s simple trick as well as her self-implosion, and couldn’t bare how cute she was. It felt like he was watching a couple of girls playing together.\nHowever, that soon came to an end. With Kratia’s free pass, they passed through 70% of the facility and finally stopped in front of a large building.\n\"Starting here, it was impossible for me to do alone. A lot of monsters, and I mean a lot of monsters come. There are a lot of traps as well, and you have to control your magic during all of this. There’s no time to even follow the commands. You just have to get through.\"\nOf course, the reason that the Royal Magician Leader had created this facility was to give the trainee a specific task and in the process of passing, they would become better at controlling magic, thus becoming a better magician overall.\nBut because the danger of this facility was so high, anyone would pass if they got through the facility as well.\n\"Do I just need to take care of the monsters?\"\n\"If you can.\"\n\"It should be fine if I just burn the entire facility.\"\n\"That could... work.\"\n\"Alright, then let’s start.\"\n\"Wait a sec.\"\nKratia stopped Prince, who was about to enter the facility. Compared to when she was teasing her before, Kratia spoke in a quite serious tone.\n\"Since so much time has passed, the facility has developed in a completely different direction from the original creator’s wishes. We have to prepare as much as we can.\"\n\"So you want to use tricks instead of doing it fairly? I can’t do that. My pride as a magician won’t allow me to!\"\n\"You had a free pass all the way here, and yet...\"\n\"All the more reason that I have to prove myself here! If you’re afraid, then I’ll go in first. You can follow behind me!\"\nHe knew this would happen eventually, but it happened at a crucial time; Prince didn’t heed Kratia’s warning and charged. Kratia clicked her tongue as she saw Prince charge into the facility alone. Lee Shin Woo spoke carefully.\n\"Do we not need to follow her?\"\n\"She’ll come out soon. You get a chance to do that.\"\nKratia ended up being right. Once she said that, Prince rushed out of the facility while shivering and looking as though she would cry. She had only been in there for but a moment, yet her clothes were in tatters and beneath her ripped robes, he could slightly see her lingerie top.\n\"T-The monsters... the monsters...!\"\n\"There, there. It’ll be fine.\"\nShe had received such an extreme shock that she temporarily reverted to a preschooler, so Lee Shin Woo comforted her. Above all, the scariest part was that the facility was still extremely quiet, even at this very moment.\nLee Shin Woo comforted Prince and waited for Kratia to explain the facility to them. She smiled slightly and said honestly.\n\"Despite it being a subspace that was creating by connecting several dungeons together, it wasn’t managed properly and was neglected for dozens of years, so there are a lot of monsters clumped up in that limited space. They’re all at least level 6...\"\n\"How many?\"\n\"...I could only count about 50,000. Plus, it’s frustrating because whenever you mess up, the monsters are all buffed.\"\n\"Hoh.\"\nThe moment he heard that, Lee Shin Woo equipped his sword, the Breath of the Lightning God. One in each hand at that!\n\"That sounds really interesting.\"\nLee Shin Woo hadn’t understood why he had to come to a facility designed to train magicians, but now he did. ’Kratia, thanks for bringing me here!’\n\"Then, shall we go in when we’re all ready?\"\n\"I really like that about you.\"\nThe mana that once flowed throughout his body was redirected into his two Breath of the Lightning Gods. As if responding to him, Kratia concentrated mana into her orb while bringing out magical devices that he’d never even seen before one by one.\nPrince, who was silently watching them from the side, said.\n\"Can I go after I change my clothes?\"",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 28 part4",
    "content": "<Chapter 28. Kratia’s Quest - 4>\nIn a place where he couldn’t see her, Prince Altania quickly changed her clothes, came out, (it seems like heroes carry around a few sets of their equipment in case of an emergency) and spoke while glaring at Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Forget what you saw.\"\n\"Of course, I didn’t see anything.\"\n\"Don’t ever tell anyone.\"\n\"I understand.\"\n\"If you do, I’ll kill you for real! I’ll stake my mana on it!\"\n\"I already told you that I wouldn’t.\"\nLee Shin Woo said he’d do as she asked, and threw her a disarming smile. Prince blushed and tugged on the lower end of her clothes. If Jin were here, he would’ve probably been astonished at the way Lee Shin Woo handled her and would’ve unnecessarily kicked him.\nThat’s right. Prince, who had gone into the training facility alone and had returned in defeat, had her robes torn to shreds, so her true identity was revealed to both Lee Shin Woo and Kratia. Of course, they both knew prior that she was a woman, but Prince had no way of knowing that.\n\"Damn it, I guess there’s no helping since I’ve been caught... Hoo.\"\nPrince said, and at the same time, took off her necklace. At that moment, her hair, which hadn’t even been short before, lengthened to her waist, her adam’s apple sunk in, the shape of her eyes softened a bit, and her overall vibe became feminine. He had somewhat expected this when she was disguised as a man, but she was incredibly beautiful.\nHer body, which hadn’t really had any curves before was now... Unfortunately, her body barely changed. Around that time, Prince had noticed Lee Shin Woo’s gaze, raised her eyebrows, and glared at him.\n\"What? What is it?\"\nHer true voice was obviously that of a young girl. Lee Shin Woo just shrugged his shoulders at her fierce reaction. He couldn’t tell her the real reason, so he had no choice but to relay some other facts that he’d figured out about her.\n\"It just seems like your magic has increased significantly, Senior. Do you normally use your magic to maintain your disguise?\"\n\"...It’s complicated.\"\n\"I suppose it must be.\"\nIf one made a mistake in the Empire, then they would die. Even so, she tied down her mana for it, which meant that she was also willing to take the associated risks with doing so.\n\"In any case, it’s a relief that you’re willing to help us.\"\n\"Kuu.\"\nLee Shin Woo decided not to say anymore. Humans possessed beliefs they wanted to realize, no matter how naive or foolish. So long as she didn’t drag him into that stupidity, then it was fine.\n\"Shin Woo, are you ready?\"\n\"I’m good.\"\n\"How about you?\"\n\"Don’t look down on me. Since I’ve returned to my original form, I won’t lose to...\"\n\"Then let’s go in.\"\n\"Ugh...!\"\nKratia used her orb to absorb as much of the ambient mana as possible, freeze it, and enclosed her body with it. It was at the level of one of the 12 generals!\nAs if she were competing, Prince concentrated mana into her staff, but it was weaker than Kratia’s.\n\"Damn it, why is this newbie a level 7...\"\n\"You’ll become level 7 soon, Senior. If that happens, you won’t lose to her.\"\n\"Yeah, as I thought, you’re really not bad, Lee Shin Woo!\"\n\"...Shin Woo, you’re acting like a nanny.\"\nThey finished with their preparations and took a deep breath. After that, they immediately entered the training facility. Coincidentally, the moment Lee Shin Woo entered the facility, he could understand how Prince felt.\n[Welcome to the nineteenth training exercise.]\nThere was another world inside.\n\"Hey, this is...\"\n\"The true nature of subspace magic hasn’t been discovered yet. The best a human being could achieve at the time was to imitate the mystery applied to a dungeon and use it. However, the Royal Magician Leader, Feotane Von Seldin, brashly tied several dungeons together and treated it like a single subspace...\"\nKratia calmly explained that, as a result of neglecting the facility for dozens of years and allowing it to develop on its own, the inside of this tiny training facility ended up becoming the size of a small scale city.\nIt was exactly as she said. He couldn’t find any traces of the original training facility, and half of it was made up of jungles and caverns; it looked like a wilderness that had been increased in size by several times. Above all, there were hidden magic traps everywhere, and...\n[Gureureureukuaaaaaaah!]\n[Kiuoooooh!]\nThere was such an overwhelming amount of monsters that the ground beneath them was barely visible. Plus, like Kratia had said, they were all level 6 wild animal type monsters!\n[The training exercise will begin soon. You must stop the activation of the 297 magic traps in time, and you must annihilate the 666 monsters. A few of the magic traps activate as soon as the training exercise begins, so please figure out where they are beforehand.]\n\"Hey, no matter how I look at it, this isn’t 666 monsters!\"\n\"We can’t get into the next facility until we pass this training exercise. So we have no choice but to break the entire facility!\"\n\"Hey, they’re coming. They’re coming right now!\"\n[Beginning training exercise.]\n[Kuwaaaaaaaaah!]\nOnce the faint guide voice vanished, the monsters were released from their confined area. At the same time, a variety of different magic traps activated!\nHowever, Kratia, as if waiting for that very moment, released the frost that had been around her. Everything around her was frozen, whether it be the ground, the air, or anything between! In this dreamlike landscape where time seemed to stop... Kratia yelled.\n\"Go, Shin Woo! Hurry!\"\n\"Lightning Sprint!\"\nHe wanted to use this sprint skill with Jin, but he had no choice. Lee Shin Woo kicked off the ground and activated the high rank sprint skill, Lightning Sprint.\nAt that moment, the rushing mana that flowed through his bones turned into golden lightning and enveloped his body. It was like being covered in animal skin made of lightning. Plus.\n[You are fighting against an irrational amount of monsters, as well as countless magic traps. The Rebellion skill has become Lv4, all stats have increased by 5, and the effect has increased!]\n[Through the Rebellion skill, all stats have increased by 16%. Because Kratia Melloi is here, who you have made a deep contractual relationship with, all stats increase by a further 11%. Half of the effect is applied to your comrades as well!]\nThe Rebellion skill leveled up at a great time. Plus, the effectiveness increased even further. In an instant, his stats had increased by 27%, which would increase the power of his skills as well, effectively amplifying Lee Shin Woo’s strength. Furthermore, Kratia, as well as Prince, who was temporarily on his team, received half of those effects as well!\n\"It feels like my magic has been increased all of a sudden...\"\n\"I’m going!\"\nIt was as if the two Breath of the Lightning Gods he was wielding were reacting to his Lightning Sprint, as lightning covered his body and emitted sparks. He charged at the group of monsters attacking his party. It was pretty much his first time using the skill against monsters, but he looked really natural.\n\"It’s a trap!\"\n\"Not a problem!\"\nThe moment he charged, the magical traps that Kratia hadn’t been able to stop activated. They came from the ground, tried to weigh him down from above, attacked from midair, attempted to transport him to another space, aimed to poison him, or would put him to sleep, but all of them futilely bounced off the lightning that enclosed his body and disappeared.\nThat was the power of an element that had reached the high rank level.\n’Nice, it’s really good!’\nLee Shin Woo, who realized that the traps couldn’t hurt him, rushed towards the group of monsters without hesitation. His two blades, which seemed like the maw of a beast, violently and nimbly ripped apart the monsters from the front.\n[Ku-Kuhat!?]\n[Hishiiiiii!]\nAt the moment of impact, he killed seven monsters in a single strike, and when they left only bone and vanished, the other monsters flinched. However, Lee Shin Woo didn’t stop. He was maintaining his Lightning Sprint, and that allowed him to quickly push forward.\nIt felt like he had become Jin. He could move incomparably fast compared to normal, and his response time was likewise incomparable. Lee Shin Woo pierced through the heads of the monsters that dared to strike from above, and would rip through the sides and shoot lightning at the monsters that attempted to bypass him and strike at his allies!\n[Kihik!]\n[Kyaaaah!]\nThe monsters would be shocked and paralyzed just by being near him. The time they were paralyzed was extremely short, but as of now, it was more than enough time for Lee Shin Woo to decapitate them. The Breath of the Lightning Gods that he was wielding spewed lightning, and whenever they cried out, the monsters’ bodies would explode.\n\"Huaaaaaaah!\"\n[Kugaaaahk!]\nThere was even a pleasant surprise; though there was the mana consumption that came from maintaining Lightning Sprint... Lee Shin Woo hadn’t thought of training his intermediate Mana Bone with it.\nThe facility had become twisted after dozens of years of neglect, and mana had accumulated more and more within this space, so his bones crazily drew in the ambient mana and covered any mana consumption he had. Rather, he had so much mana that it felt like it would overflow, and he used that overflowing mana to increase the size of his lightning. Mana Bone and Lightning Sprint had formed an equilibrium.\n’I see. Perhaps...’\nWithin a second, Lee Shin Woo sprinted, swung his sword dozens of times, killed several hundreds of monsters, and then realized something.\nHe’d caught a glimpse of it when his party had gone through the level 6 dungeon, but fighting against level 6 monsters and overpowering them so easily, he couldn’t help but realize.\n[Critical Hit!]\n[Critical Hit!]\n[Kuhaaah!]\nHe was strong.\nReally strong.\n[Gueehk!]\n[Critical Hit!]\nBecause almost all of the monsters he’d fought so far had been a higher level than him, he had either avoided them, caused them to destroy each other, made traps, attacked together with allies, or tricked them, so he had thought he wouldn’t be able to judge his abilities, but that was a huge misunderstanding.\n[Critical Hit!]\n[Critical Hit!]\nRule of Bone, Bursting Thunder, the Lightning Element, Combat Sense, Mana Bone, Bone Armory, Lightning Sprint, and Rebellion. These abilities he’d desperately gathered in order to get stronger, as well as the experiences and the memories of higher leveled enemies mixed together and were making him stronger.\nIn the beginning, he had done this in order to beat higher leveled enemies. It was strange for him not to overpower enemies that were at the same level. Regardless of whether they numbered in the hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands!\nIn this world, one powerful individual could trample several weaklings. Now, level 6 monsters were nothing more than weakling that he could trample over.\n\"L-Lightning? Keuk, Fire Demon’s Grip!\"\nIt had been 2 seconds since he’d started the battle, and within that time, Lee Shin Woo had killed hundreds of monsters. Around that time, Prince began participating in the battle. Large scale destruction was a magician’s specialty! She had done as Kratia had asked, swallowed down her pride, and prepared a large scale magic attack before she had entered the facility.\n[Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaahk!]\n[Guoooooooooooh!]\nFlame magic was so powerful that people often remarked that no other element could match it in terms of pure destructive capability. That destructive power, as well as fire’s tendency to draw in its surrounding to increase its durability, were all closely connected to destruction and death.\nThe effect of her spell that she called ’Fire Demon’s Grip’ was impressive, and just as she’d wanted, the jungle was completely burnt and hundreds of monsters were killed in an instant. The flames didn’t die out, as the destructive flames spread in every direction, and tormented the surrounding monsters.\n\"Hut, how is it...\"\nShe was tired after casting such a spell and Prince turned around to the other two and was momentarily speechless. During the small time while she was casting her spell, hundreds of monsters were cut apart by Lee Shin Woo while he sprinted around, but...\n\"Clear, clear, clear...\"\nShe thought that Kratia wouldn’t have any energy left after casting such a large scale ice spell at the beginning, but Kratia was aiming her orb with one hand to stop all the monsters that came towards them. Kratia used her other hand to create a magic circle to find all the magic traps and disarm them one by one. They were going through the training that the Royal Magic Leader had wanted!\n\"Hey, you said that was impossible before...\"\n\"Shin Woo’s helping me out a lot, so I can do it now. I’m going to break through them all at once. You help too. Clear.\"\nIt was then that Prince completely accepted it. Kratia wasn’t just a higher level or had more magic than her, she was also superior in knowledge and understanding, both of which were essential for a magician!

    "content": "<Chapter 28. Kratia’s Quest - 5>\nNormally, there was a limit to how much a dungeon could hold. If no one were to visit the facility after such a long time, then it was obvious that the number of monsters within the dungeon would multiply as a result of them breeding or the dungeon forming new monsters, but when they reach their limit, the creation of monsters slows down or completely stops.\n[Kuwaaaaaahk!]\n\"Tch, there’s no end to them... Heup!\"\n[Critical Hit!]\nBut because the Royal Magician Leader had tied several dungeons together and broadened his magic, he had caused the facility to overcome that limitation.\nOf course, he probably didn’t intend for the dungeon to spawn an infinite amount of monsters. He had only created this facility to cultivate the skills of the Royal Magicians. However, none of them had come looking for the facility, and even the Royal Magician Leader himself hadn’t visited; plus, several years had passed, so as a result, it had become something like an infinite monster spawner.\nThere were supposed to be 666 monsters in the nineteenth training facility, yet there were at least 60,000 of them.\n\"Hoooo... Huaaaap!\"\n[Critical Hit!]\nLee Shin Woo overlapped both his Breath of the Lightning Gods and swung downwards. The mana following through his blades transformed into a streak of lightning and exploded, eradicating the monsters in the whole area. In an instant, a section of the monsters was annihilated and the ground unearthed. Seeing that, Prince trembled.\n\"How is he... Is he a magician!?\"\n\"Shin Woo’s a better magician than you.\"\n\"Hey, stop chatting and kill monsters!\"\nOne of Bursting Thunder’s large-scale techniques: Lightningbolt. This high rank skill caused a large amount of lightning element mana to be discharged through a particular method, and the atmospheric mana would be gathered, creating a single lightningbolt, which would then be dropped from the sky.\nSince it was a technique that could only be used with a specific method in a specific situation, it was very much inferior to Kratia’s Catalyst Magic, which would unconditionally transform mana into ice. However, in terms of destructive power alone, it didn’t lose out.\n[Kihi, Kihaaaa...]\n\"Nice. Now I can finally see what’s in front of me.\"\nLee Shin Woo had poked a hole through a section of the monsters, flashed a relaxed smile at the hesitating group of monsters, and straightened out his posture. He had refrained from using a technique that consumed so much mana before, but it was a bit of a different story when mana was pouring into him from every direction.\n[Kyahaaaaaaaaahk!]\n\"Oh no you don’t!\"\n[Kugugugugugagagahk!]\nEven now, he was using more than 50% of his mana, but whenever the monsters died, they would release a ton of mana, which would then be instantly drawn into his body, compensating for more than half of his lost mana.\nHe seized that opportunity and pushed in with his two blades, using the lightning they created to cut through the monsters in the area in a single stroke. If he were training his mana, then he could say that this was the best training ever!\n’The flow of the rushing mana is... I can feel it clearly. There’s so much mana that I feel dizzy. But if I can control it completely, then...!’\nAll of his bones would absorb close to their limit in mana at each and every moment, and then he would discharge it, followed by absorbing that quantity of mana again.\nIt was like he was breathing through his bones; his bones needed to breathe in and out as much as they could. If his bones were lungs, then they would’ve either stopped functioning or exploded.\n\"One more time... Lightningbolt!\"\n[Critical Hit!]\nHowever, he wasn’t tired nor did he retreat. His body, which had been reinforced through Rule of Bone, would never break. Rather, his body seemed like it wanted more mana, as it breathed in even stronger than before, and absorbed more mana than his previous limitation, turning that mana into his own.\nAt that moment, his skill had surpassed its limitation and grew.\n[The Intermediate Mana Bone skill has become Lv10 and has evolved into the high rank level! Magic has increased by 200! You can proficiently control mana with just your mind, and can now more easily manipulate the surrounding mana. You can now react more perfectly to any type of attack that involves mana.]\n[The Rule of Bone skill has become Lv9. All stats have increased by 5. You can now strengthen your bones even further while using less mana.]\nAs expected, a comprehensive, high rank mana skill was different from any normal skill. Originally, Lee Shin Woo’s magic was 2,025, so with the Mana Bone’s level up to the high rank, his magic had increased by 10%. Moreover, the effectiveness of the skill had increased as well, so that 10% wasn’t really just 10%.\nHe could release mana and absorb mana quicker than before. Since everything he did was related to mana, with just that rank up, his fighting strength increased. Moreover, Rule of Bone had leveled up as well, so the weight behind each and every blow would be even heavier!\n[Critical Hit!]\n[Critical Hit!]\nLee Shin Woo was like a thunderstorm, as he rushed in with two blades in hand, and cut the monsters to pieces.\n\"Hey, he got stronger all of a sudden!\"\n\"I can’t lose!\"\nPrince stirred as she saw what Lee Shin Woo was doing on the battlefield, and Kratia’s eyes likewise lit up, as she cast more spells. They were losing to Lee Shin Woo in magic, even though they possessed karmas that specialized in only magic, so how could their pride not be hurt!?\n\"Eek, I can’t lose to a newbie...!\"\n\"Clear, clear...\"\nThough Prince had been daunted at her failure at the beginning, she shook it off, and sucked in the ambient mana; she concentrated on casting her most powerful spell as quickly as possible. She had to surpass her limitations in this pressing situation!\n\"Fire Demon - Explosion! All of you, burn! Fire Demon’s kick!\"\n\"Clear, clear, clear...\"\nOn the other end, Kratia focused on more quickly disarming the traps within her absolute defense shield. According to her, this definitely wasn’t the last of the facilities. There were a few more facilities filled with more powerful monsters and more vicious traps.\n’We can’t go on by just killing the monsters, and if we were to fail, even after killing this many monsters, I’m afraid of all the new variables that’ll come from challenging it again.’\nIf that’s the case, then her job wasn’t to kill as many monsters as possible or find the traps set up here but to find the traps that were deeper in, so that she could disarm them immediately. After all, that was the purpose of this training exercise!\nShe’d already accomplished several feats by doing so and had even reached level 7, so she thought she could do this.\n\"Clear, clear... Shin Woo, there aren’t that many traps left!\"\n\"Then, I guess I just need to slaughter the rest of these guys!\"\nLee Shin Woo took a deep breath. It wasn’t like any oxygen would go into his lungs, but he was able to prepare himself for another large-scale attack.\n’Heuuuuuup!’\nLee Shin Woo split the plentiful mana in his body into two: one part went into Lightning Sprint, and the other... went into Lightning Shadow, a technique he’d never actually used before. It was the general, Hansen Von Dorthe’s namesake, and was a technique that processed mana into a unique state: a buff that strengthened the body!\nBecause Hansen Von Dorthe wasn’t able to completely transform his body into lightning, the lightning damaged himself as well, but to Lee Shin Woo, who could freely change his interior mana, that didn’t apply to him. At the very least, Lee Shin Woo far surpassed Hansen Von Dorthe in terms of mana control.\n’As expected, the mana consumption is huge, but... there’s nowhere else that I can practice the combination of Lightning Sprint and Lightning Shadow but here, where mana is just pouring in!’\nLightning Sprint, which coated the exterior in lightning.\nLightning Shadow, which altered his interior into lightning element mana.\nIf he combined the two into one, then what would be the result? It made his heart pound.\n’Keuk, Kuhaaaa...!’\nBut combining the two skills together? He could barely breathe just from using both of the skills simultaneously. If Mana Bone hadn’t leveled up to the high rank level, then he wouldn’t have been able to even attempt this.\nBut even amidst the pain that felt like his body was breaking apart, Lee Shin Woo grit his teeth and kept his eyes wide open. A large number of sparks were emitted from his body, making it difficult to even see what was in front of him. The powerful lightning that flowed from inside and outside his body antagonized him and viciously bared its teeth at him.\nIt felt like that powerful energy would only be satisfied if either he or his enemies were destroyed.\n’If that’s the case, then...!’\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo’s two blades became lightning teeth and shined, the lightning exploded. The earth exploded, and the sky cried out. The monsters’ bodies scattered and vaporized into beads of blood.\n[The Lightning Shadow skill has become Lv2. Strength and Magic have increased by 10. You can now more naturally control the lightning permeating your body.]\nNo one could see his skill. They would’ve either been swept up in it and exploded, or been cut apart by it and blown away.\nHe had gathered the surrounding mana and made it his own, and in the next moment, discharged the lightning, so it was much greater than Kratia’s own Catalyst Magic.\n\"What is he... He’s scary...\" Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on novｅlfire.net\n\"Clear, clear... Clear.\"\nPrince, who had been gathering magic to cast her spell, stopped in shock. Contrary to her, Kratia remained calm and continued to disarm the magic traps. However, at some point, she stopped. She had finally disarmed all the magic traps.\n’But the fact that the alarm’s not ringing means that we really do have to kill all of the monsters.’\nHowever, there weren’t even that many monsters left. It would’ve been impossible if Kratia had come alone, even if she had a hundred years. Since new monsters would be created while she disarmed the magic traps and killed the monsters!\n’Shin Woo didn’t realize just how powerful he was, huh.’\nLee Shin Woo looked like an extremely impressive warrior while fighting against the monsters, but Kratia saw him more as a magician than a warrior.\nDespite the fact that he was plenty skilled enough, he would stake his life in anything he did and fight against enemies where victory wasn’t assured, so he would always prepare alternative methods to beat his enemies. Even if he was a good match, he would take a step back and calmly assess the situation and then respond.\nHowever, that wasn’t because of fear. It was so that he could completely overwhelm his opponent. Because of that, he had underestimated his own abilities. But honestly, his abilities were amazing, so could it even be said that he had a weakness? Kratia just shook her head.\n[Kuha, Gaaaaaahk...]\n\"The end.\"\nWhile Kratia was briefly caught up in her thoughts, Lee Shin Woo’s blade pierced through the last monster’s head. At that moment, Lightning Shadow and Lightning Sprint were released, and he felt drained, but at the same time, he was filled with joy. He hadn’t succeeded the first time, but he had found a clue on how to combine Lightning Shadow and Lightning Sprint.\n[Training exercise passed. Congratulations. You may now head into the next facility.]\nDid it even know how difficult the training was? The appearance of the small world was hidden at the same time they heard the monotone voice.\nThey could now progress to the next training facility.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 28 part6",
    "content": "<Chapter 28. Kratia’s Quest - 6>\nIt had been a week since Lee Shin Woo’s group had entered the magic training facility. They rested in between and were somehow able to clear the twentieth facility. They rested for almost an entire day and after they were completely ready, they entered the twenty-first facility and were struggling.\nLee Shin Woo thought this facility was the equivalent of 10 high level dungeons, but he didn’t make the judgment solely based on the number of monsters.\n\"Kratia, they’re spawning behind you!\"\n\"Keuk, what level magic did they plant here...!?\"\n\"All of you come out since I’ll burn you all! Fire Demon’s eyes!\"\nHe said this several time before, but each facility was going in a different direction than what the producer had intended. It wasn’t just the quantity of monsters; it also took into account the reinforcement magic that was set up, as well as the magic traps.\nA few subspaces were overlapping, which caused the size of the facility to increase, and in the process of that expansion, the magic traps intensified due to the quantity of mana. What’s worse, in the process of expanding, the spawn locations became much worse for them.\n[Activating reinforcement magic. Activating reinforcement magic.]\n[Kuhaahk!]\n\"Ah, wait a sec. Is that...\"\n\"This is crazy... Kratia, get back. I said get back!\"\nMoreover, the reinforcement magic was supposed to activate only if they failed in disarming the magic traps, but because the magic traps had changed, they activated on their own without them even touching them and continuously reinforced the monsters.\nAnd if a few chances stacked up, then something would appear that they couldn’t be happy about.\n[Lv7 Metal Ape Chimera]\nLike a level 7 elite monster suddenly appearing when there should only be level 6 monsters residing within this facility.\n[Kuwaaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\n\"Ah, crap. What the hell is that!? What the hell is a chimera?\"\n\"If you go that way, you’ll really die, Senior! Wait no, the right side. Kratia, disarm that trap over there!\"\n\"I’m doing it... Clear!\"\nThere was an art technique known as decalcomania. One would paint on the surface of a material that wouldn’t absorb the pigment, and then it would either be folded in half, or one would get a new piece of paper and cover it; either way, the original art would be transferred intact.\n\"Clear! Shin Woo!\"\n\"Get back for now. I’ll take it on, so get back!\"\n[Kuhwaaaaaaahk!]\nRight now, the space was expanding and was repeatedly combining. Soon, rule and order was lost, and everything was mixed up; at the end of this chaos, everything was completely recreated. That Chimera, which was created from countless monsters overlapping in the same space, was the result of this chaos as well. If the Royal Magician Leader, Feotane Von Seldin’s goal was to kill everyone inside, then he did a great job.\n[Kiiiiiiiiiiiii!]\n\"T-There’s no way we can beat it. How can we beat a level 7 elite? We’ll die. There’s no choice but to die.\"\n\"Senior, please take care of the weak mobs. I’ll take care of it.\"\n\"You’re level 6!\"\nPrince had fought bravely against the normal level 6 monsters without stopping, but once the elite level 7 monster, the Metal Ape Chimera appeared, she completely lost her will to fight.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo dual wielded the Breath of the Lightning Gods and grinned at her.\n\"You know that I’m no normal level 6.\"\n\"Keut...\"\nIt was frustrating, but Prince had to nod at that.\nJust conquering this facility should be considered karma due to the hardships they had to endure, and with her repeated, desperate struggles, Prince’s skills had grown tremendously. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that she’d become a different person.\nIt was the same for Kratia as well. Her magic control became more exquisite day by day, and her Catalyst Magic, which changed the mana around her through her orb, took a major step forward. Above all, her maximum capacity of magic had definitely increased.\n’However...’\nBut whenever her affable and meek junior entered the battlefield, he would sweep through his enemies like a typhoon... Lee Shin Woo was beyond her understanding.\nHe had said that God had given him the ability to wrap powerful lightning around his body, so that was fine. Lee Shin Woo was also a warrior who could gather a ton of mana, which could also be explained away by his trip to God’s garden, so she could somewhat understand that.\nBut when she put all that together and looked at her own growth, she could say that the biggest problem was that Lee Shin Woo far surpassed both her and Kratia. After they had rested and gone through the twentieth facility, she had passed it off as a high rank skill, but now she was sure.\nWhenever he went through a facility, he got a lot stronger!\n’He’s definitely gotten faster than when he was in the twentieth facility. He’s definitely gotten stronger too, and his magic has increased as well. So much so that even a person that isn’t proficient in close combat like me can tell...’\nHis growth rate was much faster than hers. How was that even possible? Did he buy a pile of medicine from the secret shop and take it all?\nNo, they were splitting the Perium equally between the three of them, so she was well aware that he couldn’t come up with that much Perium. He’d probably leveled up his skills only once or twice, and their achievements should’ve been relatively the same. Then how!?\n’Of course, stat growth differs between individuals. Differences do exist. However! Even so, it’s still too fast! It’s way too fast!’\nHow about Lloyd? He was a level 6 warrior that was on the cusp of being level 7. He was tough, and with a buff, he would be able to take on monsters without retreating; it made him feel like a truly reliable iron wall.\nShe felt a sense of ease whenever Lloyd would stand in front of her and protect her, and it made her feel like she wanted to stay like that forever.\nBut right now, she didn’t even really remember what his abilities were like. Instead, her memories were replaced by a storm, a lightning storm that disintegrated everything in its path.\n’Keuk, no way. If he and Lloyd were to fight one on one, Lloyd wouldn’t lose. He definitely wouldn’t!’\nShe arduously muttered, even though she wasn’t really sure of her own words. Plus, even if Lloyd could beat Lee Shin Woo right now, Lee Shin Woo would definitely become stronger than him soon with his monstrous growth rate.\n\"Kratia, can you use that debuff you used last time?\"\n\"It’ll be a bit weaker than last time. ...But you’re a lot stronger than last time, Shin Woo.\"\n\"And our opponents are a lot weaker than last time, too.\"\n\"Hueut.\"\nWhile Prince was half panicking, Lee Shin Woo and Kratia exchanged a few words, smiled, and turned around towards their enemy. Through the past week, he had continuously used these two skills and now that he knew they were compatible with each other, he instantly clad his body in both Lightning Shadow and Lightning Sprint.\n[Kuwooooooooh!]\nThe Metal Ape Chimera was a level 7 elite that possessed a truly horrific form, as it was composed of different monsters, and it gained herculean strength, size, and armor once it hit level 7.\nPlus, its intelligence must have improved as it leveled up as well; as it roared, it kept its guard up against Lee Shin Woo and couldn’t move easily. It should’ve approximated Lee Shin Woo’s strength, so it was the obvious move.\nSomehow, my stats have increased by about 1,000.’\nPrince didn’t know how Lee Shin Woo had grown so quickly, but the answer was obvious. He had used Bone Reinforcement!\nTens of thousands of level 6 monsters had appeared, so obviously, tens of thousands of bones would drop. Kratia, who knew about his situation, gave the bones to Lee Shin Woo without him asking, and he told Prince that he had a lot of secret shop permits, so he’d sell them in her stead, so he received all the bones.\nHe kept half of them for Jin, but even so, there were more than 30,000 bones there. There was no way his stats wouldn’t rise.\n’This is a treasure trove. It wouldn’t be this efficient, even if you combined 10, no 20 dungeons together. Plus, in such a short time... I have to thank the Royal Magician Leader if I meet him.’\nFrom just the first facility, his stats had increased by 500, and with the second facility, his stats had increased by another 300. All of his skills leveled up as well, netting him another 100 plus stats, so the stat change was quite noticeable. Moreover, right now...\n[Kuwaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\n[You are fighting a high leveled foe. Through the Rebellion skill, all stats increase by an additional 16%!.]\nBecause he had been fighting such a large volume of enemies, his Rebellion skill had activated and his stats had already been increased, but his skill activated once more. The Rebellion skill had increased his stats by 43%. It was the same as a level up.\n’Moreover, my stats have surpassed 6,000, so...’\nIt filled in the gap that his skills had left. Even if he didn’t have Kratia’s debuff, he could’ve taken on the level 7.\nBecause of the intense situation and the repeated battles that came in such a short period of time, Lee Shin Woo now had a somewhat objective grasp on his strength.\n\"Good. Shall we...!?\"\n[Gureureuraaaaaa!]\nThe lightning bared its fangs as he rushed towards the Metal Ape Chimera. The Metal Ape Chimera didn’t seem to back down, as it snarled... suddenly, it ordered the nearby monsters to attack Lee Shin Woo!\n\"The strategy’s fair and square, but it doesn’t match it’s appearance!\"\n\"Prince!\"\n\"Oh, I... I got it, damn it.\"\nKratia, who was watching the situation, spoke harshly. Fortunately, Prince responded on time. The fire that she’d shot out instantly burnt the monsters to a crisp and Lee Shin Woo cut down the dozens of monsters left in front with a forceful swing of his Breath of the Lightning God.\nBlack energy was mixed with the lightning, forming a giant horn. An extremely sharp and secretive horn: Shadow Horn!\n\"Shadow Horn!\"\nIt was still impossible for him to project shadows, but he could activate a portion of the gigantification ability of the intermediate Shadow Horn ability, which caused the horn to become even larger.\nWith reflexes befitting a level 7 elite, the Metal Ape Chimera stretched out its arm covered in thick armor, and attempted to block it. Unfortunately, the armor broke into pieces and the shadow continued on, destroying its forearm.\n[Critical Hit!]\n[Kyaaaaaaaahk!]\nIt uttered a horrific cry, and its legs squirmed. Its movements caused the entire space to roll around, and all the magic traps simultaneously activated, aiming for Lee Shin Woo.\nIt could even control the traps!? Lee Shin Woo was inwardly taken aback, but he trusted in his comrades and took a step forward instead. The lightning intensified.\n\"Kuaaaaaaaaaah!\"\n[Gueeeeeeeeeh!]\nBefore the magic traps hit Lee Shin Woo, frost descended upon the entire area. The traps were temporarily disabled, and the Metal Ape Chimera’s movements likewise slowed. The next moment, Lee Shin Woo exploded his inner energy and unleashed his new ability onto it.\n\"Twin Lightning Fall!\"\nAs quick as lighting, and as weighty as a mountain. The lightning was concentrated in both his arms and blades and made each of them look like dragon teeth. He swung his two swords down upon the chimera’s head. With a crackle, an electric current so large that it was goosebump inducing, passed through the Chimera.\n[Keheeeeeeeehk!]\n\"Umph!\"\n\"Clear, clear, clear!\"\nLee Shin Woo, whose attack had succeeded, dodged the Chimera’s powerful counterattack, and fell back for now; during that time, Kratia didn’t even confirm Lee Shin Woo’s status and continued to disable the traps.\nSince they now knew that the Metal Ape Chimera had control over the magic traps, she had to disable the traps as quickly as possible so they wouldn’t be put in more danger.\n\"Prince, take care of the mobs!\"\n\"You guys are way too frantic...! Eeeeeeek!\"\nPrince was so busy helping them out that she felt like she’d cry. When she was with Lloyd, they would’ve waved their hands and ran away from a battle like this...! But what the hell was with these guys? They liked the situation and were full of energy!\n\"If you guys die, I’m going to run!\"\n\"We won’t die! If you do as you’re supposed to!\"\n\"Senior, please take care of this side too.\"\n\"Ah, seriously!\"\nWith Kratia and Prince’s superb assistance, the number of monsters blocking Lee Shin Woo’s way was reduced, and the magic traps were disabled one or two at a time.\nThere were still some external factors that could endanger him, but he could take it. None of them could hurt Lee Shin Woo, who had become a streak of lightning as he ran, except for that level 7 gorilla.\n[Kuhaaaaa!]\nBut when he briefly diverted his attention to the level 6 monsters, the Metal Ape Chimera seized that opportunity and signaled their counterattack.\nFirstly, it sprayed its mana in all directions, and forcefully vibrated it, dispersing Lee Shin Woo’s mana. It turned its armor into blades and attempted to cut him in half! But ironically, that gave Lee Shin Woo a chance to grow.\n’It simultaneously canceled out both my internal and external mana...!?’\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo’s interior and exterior were temporarily canceled out, he was able to use Lightning Sprint and Lightning Shadow together, even though he’d barely been able to use them separately until now.\n[Kuha?]\nThe next moment, the ape’s arm, which had been half cut, flew through the air. Right above it, a golden crack appeared. Lee Shin Woo started from its wrist to its shoulder, all the way to its neck and even reached its head! ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ noⅴelfire.net\n\"Ku, hoo...\"\nThe crack stopped above its head, where Lee Shin Woo was. He deactivated both Lightning Sprint and Lightning Shadow and was gasping, but he couldn’t forget that sense of unity he just felt.\n’It felt like I was transcending the limits of my body.’\nUnfortunately, he had only been able to use it for a split second, so he hadn’t been able to learn the skill, but that was actually a relief. If he were given that skill now and he used it, he wouldn’t be able to grow properly.\n’This is plenty. Since I’m sure that if I train, I’ll reach it.’\n[Ka, Gaaaaah...]\nLee Shin Woo smiled proudly. Simultaneously, cracks spread throughout the ape’s entire body. It muttered something incoherently and attempted to stretch its arm towards Lee Shin Woo, but it soon splintered into pieces.\n[You faced a higher level, large monster with a small group of comrades head on and defeated it. Your overwhelming strength made the level difference meaningless. All stats have increased by 3. The High Rank Lightning Element has become Lv3, and Magic has increased by 20.]\n[You have acquired 2,791,880 Perium.]\n[You have acquired the Lv7 Metal Ape Chimera’s rib bone.]\n\"Hey, if you’re done, stop posturing and help us out already!\"\n\"I’m going right now!\"\nDespite him defeating a level 7 elite, the training exercise hadn’t ended yet. There were still several monsters and magic traps left.\nIt would probably be even worse in the next facility. Lee Shin Woo quickly picked up the loot from the ground and set his heart on one thing.",

    "content": "<Chapter 28. Kratia’s Quest - 7>\n\"I’ll go bring my horse over.\"\nLee Shin Woo firmly declared after the three of them somehow cleared the twenty-first training exercise.\nHow hard could the training exercise had been if even Kratia had her hands on her knees and was out of breath. Meanwhile, Prince prostrated on the floor like Yamcha who’d been hit by a Saibaman’s self-destruct attack. It seemed like she didn’t even have the energy to keep up appearances.\n\"If you wait here, then I’ll be right back.\"\n\"Huuu... Huh?\"\nBut when Lee Shin Woo spoke as though he’d go immediately, Yamcha... No, Prince barely raised her head and responded.\n\"Wouldn’t it... be dangerous to bring your horse?\"\n\"Kratia takes care of all the training exercise objectives, and I can’t leave out my horse in battle.\"\n\"...Is it that amazing?\"\n\"Of course.\"\nHe nodded his head, then looked up at the building in front of them, or the twenty-second training facility, and spoke.\n\"I feel like this will be the last facility. I’d like to finish it together.\"\n\"Really!? That’s the last one!?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nKratia had finally caught her breath, raised her head, and spoke. Even as they had been fighting for more than two days, Kratia had been busy calculating the facility’s magic formula; it seemed like she was replenishing her sugar levels, as she ate an appetizing grape.\n\"That’s the last one. If we just clear that one, then... We can figure out everything there is to know about this facility. We can also get what Shin Woo wants, too.\"\n\"Hoo, hooo... Anyway, it feels like I’ll reach level 7 soon. I’ll participate and be the MVP again.\"\n\"Shin Woo, go ahead.\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"Hey, don’t ignore me!\"\nHe didn’t focus on the neurotic Prince’s adorable lips... and once he saw Kratia waving at him, who was passing out grapes, he retraced his steps.\n\"Hey, you!\"\n[Master.]\n\"Huh!?\"\nBut unexpectedly, he didn’t need to go back very far. During the ten days that it had taken for Lee Shin Woo to clear up to the twenty-first facility, Jin and Rem had reached the tenth training facility. Lee Shin Woo saw Jin, who was stretching and was honestly quite surprised.\n\"Did you get a bit better at controlling mana?\"\n\"I got good at dumping anything I couldn’t do onto the golem!\"\n[I have carried out your order, Master.]\nJin boasted, but if he didn’t actually try, then it would’ve been impossible to get this far. Lee Shin Woo suddenly thought that Jin might’ve gotten more out of this facility than he did.\n\"Jin, I brought you something to congratulate you.\"\n\"Fire me. I’ve done enough.\"\n\"Instead, I’ll give you a cute bone.\"\n\"Go away. I don’t want it!\"\n\"There aren’t that many elite bones, so bear with it!\"\nLee Shin Woo had prepared 50,000 level 6 bones for Jin! Honestly, there were tens of thousands more where that came from, but since the types were so similar, they wouldn’t really help either Lee Shin Woo or Jin. Therefore, he decided to save them for now and was thinking of giving them to the Pauls later.\n\"Absorbing 50,000 is impossible for me. It won’t all go in. I’ll die.\"\n\"You can do it. Believe in you who believes in yourself!\"\nLee Shin Woo grabbed onto Jin, who paled and attempted to escape, and executed Bone Reinforcement. But Jin, who’d absorbed ten bones and had increased his health by 1 went ’huh?’ and tilted his head. Orıginal content can be found at novel⚑fire.net\n\"It’s not as bad as I thought it would be.\"\n\"Your mind’s just gotten that much stronger.\"\n\"That sounds like a load of crap, but... Phew. Go ahead. I’ll do it until I can’t anymore, so keep going.\"\n\"Alright. Then let’s go a bit faster.\"\nSince Lee Shin Woo had used Bone Reinforcement so many times, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say he was a master of the craft. He took Jin’s condition into consideration and maintained an optimal speed, repeatedly consuming bones and reinforcing Jin!\nJin gritted his teeth at the repeatedly incoming memories and used the memories of his ten day struggle in the training facilities to endure. In a way, Lee Shin Woo was right. His willpower had improved ever since his struggle within the training facility!\n’...Hoo, it makes me feel like I’ve gone back to my beginner days as an athlete.’\nBack then, all he had was anger and tenacity; he recollected that time, and subconsciously smiled. Jin looked at Lee Shin Woo, who was controlling the timing of Bone Reinforcement so that he could absorb as many bones as possible, and his smile deepened even further.\nLike that, three hours passed, and around the time that Jin had absorbed about 30,000 bones, he said that he couldn’t absorb any more and gave up. He had tried really hard compared to normal.\n\"I really can’t absorb any more. Save it for next time. My stats have already increased by 700 you know!\"\n\"I’m above 6,200 now. At first, I wondered when I would reach level 7, but now I’m getting close.\"\n\"Really!? Already!? It hasn’t even been very long since you got to level 6! Hey, even after being reinforced, my stats are only a bit higher than 4,500...!\"\nOriginally, there had been a gap between them, but that gap had become decidedly wider within these past ten days. What’s worse, this was after Lee Shin Woo had used Bone Reinforcement on him with such a large quantity of bones (there were so many that \"large quantity\" didn’t seem like the right words)! Lee Shin Woo just smiled bitterly.\n\"The amount of stats you gain from leveling up high rank skills is, apparently, no joke. Especially my skill that controls mana; when it leveled up to high rank, it increased my magic by 200 all at once.\"\n\"200...\"\nPlus, the four titles that he’d gained after surpassing 1,000 in each stat, ’One Loved by Mana (Magic)’, ’He Who Dreams of Giants (Strength)’, ’He Who Follows the Wind (Agility)’, and ’He Who Resembles Stone (Health)’ increased his overall stat gain.\nWhenever he gained a title, his body would strangely be changed again, and now that he’d acquired all four titles, he felt like he was in a completely different class than before. That difference would likely become greater as he raised his level and stats.\n’Where am I headed exactly? Am I going in the right direction?’\nWould his Joker karma, which fooled his own nature (related to stats) and had allowed him to acquire all four titles, have the answer? Lee Shin Woo vacantly thought about the subject, and Jin softly bit his arm. He had removed his armor and his glowing goblin fire blazed.\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"Hey, do the rest too.\"\n\"...Are you going to be ok?\"\nLee Shin Woo usually didn’t forgive Jin’s feigned cries of pain, but he was well aware that Bone Reinforcement wasn’t always safe.\nIf one were to recklessly accept another’s memories and experiences, they might not lose their identity, but it was always possible that they could be mentally damaged.\n\"It’s ok. Right now, I can take even double this number.\"\n\"Really...? If so, then I won’t turn you down...\"\nJin was able to absorb all of his share of bones right then and there.\nHis stats increased by an additional 400. He had increased his stats by 1,100 on the spot. It was only possible because of Lee Shin Woo’s skill, Bone Reinforcement, the training facility that dropped all of these bones, and Jin’s own skill that tripled the growth rate of his agility.\n\"You don’t have any more?\"\n\"Jin, are you really ok?\"\nJin couldn’t be happier that Lee Shin Woo was worried about him. However, he really was fine. It was an issue of character. Ultimately, they were just memories from those who were deceased, so all he needed to do was pick out what he needed and learn it!\nHe was able to think that way now. Jin thought he needed to do at least this much to keep up with Lee Shin Woo, so both his mind and body were strengthened naturally. ’This thing called will is really amazing’, he suddenly thought.\n\"I’m completely fine.\"\n\"Really? Then, I have a level 7 elite bone that I thought would fit you perfectly...\"\n\"...\"\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo had gone beyond his imagination. How did he get this, when level 7 elite bones didn’t even show up in the secret shop!? Did that mean that these monstrous bastards show up later!? Jin turned ghastly pale instantaneously, but he didn’t show any signs of that to Lee Shin Woo.\n\"...It’s fine. You’re going to cut out the burdensome parts anyway, right?\"\n\"Yeah, but...\"\n\"Good, then c’mon.\"\n\"Then I’m really going to do it, ok?\"\nWhen he had absorbed the level 7 Treasure Eater’s bone, he felt like his mind had momentarily gone white. But now would be different. He felt like he could both endure the pain better, as well as absorb the memories/experiences better.\n[Consuming the Lv7 Metal Ape Chimera’s rib bone to execute Bone Reinforcement on Jin Taylor. Health has increased by 10. Proficiency in Rule of Bone has increased by 5%.]\n[Kureureu! Kuhik, Kuiiiiiiiiiii! (Hiya~! I can turn my entire arm into steel!) - Metal Ape Chimera]\n...Maybe it was just a misunderstanding. Jin was rolling on the floor while regretting his decision.\n\"How is it? Did Steel Heart level up?\"\n\"Level up... It did a lot, but... Kuuuuuuuu.\"\n\"Are you ok?\"\n\"I’m ok...!\"\nJin said he was ok, even though he was ’roughly’ rolling on the floor. It looked like his head really hurt a lot, but it was a relief that there weren’t any huge problems. Jin looked like he was in a lot of distress, so Lee Shin Woo planned to use his Assimilation skill to soothe the invasive memories; he approached, but there was something that caused him to stop.\n[Master, if there’s any extra, may I have some as well?]\n\"Huh?\"\n[Can you transfer the information and magic within the bone to me with your ability, Master?]\n\"...Ah.\"\nLee Shin Woo finally understood. It wasn’t like this originally, but in the process of becoming his subordinate, Rem changed and gained a body that was fully composed of bone! Of course, it was somewhat concerning that Rem didn’t have a complete ego of his own, but an artificial life form’s ego was still an ego.\nMoreover, Rem had been so heavily influenced by Lee Shin Woo that he could share a portion of his Joker karma. Maybe he should’ve put more care into Rem earlier. It’s just that he had never used Bone Reinforcement on a golem before.\n’And now that I think about it, the Emerald Bone Golems, the Erems are also...’\nSince they had the words Emerald ’Bone’ golem in their names, Bone Reinforcement should work on them. They were individuals who could absorb a large quantity of darkness mana and grow, so if it were possible to use Bone Reinforcement on them as well...\n[Master?]\n\"It’s nothing. I’ll do it. I should probably worry about you first.\"\nPrioritizing Rem’s reinforcement was the right call, as the Erems were doing their own thing and gathering experience elsewhere, while Rem was right beside him. Especially because he was anticipating how much stronger its Mana Parasite ability would be once it reached level 7.\n[Executing Bone Reinforcement on Rem by consuming the Lv6 Jungle Mantis’ outer shell.]\nAs expected, Rem fit within the parameters of Bone Reinforcement. Moreover, right after he used Bone Reinforcement, gloomy mana radiated from Rem’s entire body, so it seemed like it was quite effective after all.\n\"How was it?\"\n[...Impressive, Master.]\nRem briefly wavered, and then replied. And soon added on.\n[By storing information on other organisms, I believe Mana Parasite will grow even further.]\n\"Ooh, really...?\"\n[That’s correct.]\nRem caused him to think about the potential of Mana Parasite, and he tilted his head in thought. As if reading his hesitation, Rem agreed.\n[If I gather enough data to completely understand an individual, then... I feel like I will be able to use Mana Parasite on an individual who isn’t a golem.]\nHearing that, Lee Shin Woo felt a cold sweat break out, even though he couldn’t even sweat. It hadn’t even come true yet, so Lee Shin Woo decided to ignore it for now and move on.",

    "content": "<Chapter 28. Kratia’s Quest - 8>\n\"So you really did bring it with yo... Huh?\"\nPrince greeted Lee Shin Woo upon his return a few hours later atop Jin and tilted her head.\n\"It’s strange. The energy the horse is emanating feels a lot stronger than before.\"\n\"You see, whenever I get stronger, this guy is affected too, allowing him to run even faster on the battlefield. I believe it may be because of that skill.\"\n\"That’s freaking awesome!\"\nOf course, it was a lie, as Jin had gotten stronger all on his own, but Prince fell for it and was amazed. It was easier to convince her of that (a skill that allows a horse to be influenced by its master and increase its abilities) than to say that a horse had absorbed bones and raised his stats by almost 1,200 in a short period of time (it was laughable for Lee Shin Woo as well).\n’My body still feels stiff... My whole body aches. I want to lay down and sleep. Even though I can’t sleep.’\n’I still have some time before we fight, so in the meantime, I have to get used to my changed body.’\nWhenever Lee Shin Woo’s stats increased, he would adapt to his new body in live combat, but Jin had increased his stats too much, so his body should feel stiff for the time being. Because that wasn’t something Lee Shin Woo could help with, he had no choice but to leave that to him.\n\"Shin Woo, before we go in, I analyzed the condition of the facility.\"\n\"Oh. How?\"\n\"Let me explain.\"\nLee Shin Woo got off of Jin’s back, and after he’d allowed Jin to move freely, he approached Kratia and Prince.\nRem sat on his shoulder, who like Jin, had absorbed countless bones and had become incomparably stronger than before, but Prince still hadn’t noticed it. That was a how scary a disguise which made use of a person’s fixed perception was.\n\"I sounded confident, but honestly, I wasn’t able to figure out everything.\"\n\"How about destroying a bit of it from the outside?\"\nLee Shin Woo believed that when one’s mind couldn’t solve an issue, using one’s body wasn’t a bad idea. As if she had already considered his offer, Kratia laughed subtly and shook her head.\n\"If you do that, then it’ll negatively affect this space.\"\n\"That Royal Magician Leader bastard designed everything so particularly.\"\n\"It’s out of that man’s hands, so the place has grown. I acknowledge the thought and the plan behind the facility, but in terms of the important facets of magic, safety and stability, he gets a zero.\"\nKratia’s assessment was merciless. Prince, who thought that attacking with everything they had was their best move, attempted to offer up a counterargument, but no one acknowledged her, so her cheeks puffed up. It seemed like she had completely given up on trying to act like an adult male.\n\"But because the facility’s system was continuously exposed as we fought, I was able to backtrack and look into the system, allowing me to roughly know the structure and the number of monsters inside the facility.\"\n\"Huh!?\"\n\"So what you’re saying is...\"\nThe ’system’ that Kratia was talking about was also Lee Shin Woo’s objective: the artifact. She had wanted to conquer the facility and take the artifact, therefore she had taken care of the magic traps and analyzed the training facility’s magic, so the artifact was already within reach.\n\"That’s plenty. I don’t even know where it is yet.\"\n\"You just couldn’t focus on anything else since you were facing off against so many monsters, Shin Woo.\"\n\"Well, you’re not wrong.\"\nSince he had planned on training Mana Bone, Bursting Thunder, Lightning Shadow, and Lightning Sprint from the very beginning. He had wondered whether progressing with her plan had been a good idea, but he had trust in her, as she possessed a similar level of magic control as Lee Shin Woo... and his faith was well rewarded.\nBut there was still one person who couldn’t follow along with their conversation.\n\"Wait a sec. Are you saying that you hacked into the artifact, which is controlling the entire facility?\"\n\"Yep.\"\n\"How did you... I’m pretty sure a level 8 Archmage created that artifact!\"\n\"You can’t do anything if you’re only concerned about levels. Anyway, look at this.\"\nKratia said firmly, which made Prince go silent, and stretched her hand towards the floor. She began to draw a rough map of the facility’s interior. Her movements were so precise that it was as if she had scanned and printed a cross-sectional diagram.\n\"As you can see, the space is quite narrow. Because they used a spatial technique which is one level higher than the ones they used on the previous facilities, I believe the density of the mana in that limited space is increasing. Perhaps it being a training facility is just a facade, and this space was created whenever Feotane Von Seldin made progress in his spatial magic and wanted to test it out.\"\n\"The density of mana is increasing... Is it like how the mana is strengthened in a dungeon?\"\n\"Yeah, but there are more than twenty of them here... If we take into account the distortion caused by the passage of time, then it could be much higher.\"\nIt was astonishing. The reason Lee Shin Woo had been able to use as much magic as he wanted was because of this training facility’s specificity. If more mana was amassed in a narrower space, then... Just the thought of it made him feel dizzy.\n\"The density of mana is so high that contrary to our calculations, our magic might not activate. Our top priority is to adapt to the mana density inside as quickly as possible and be able to control it efficiently. Remember that.\"\n\"Ok. We could say that you’re a spatial magic professional by now.\"\n\"He’s right. ...It’s frustrating, but you’re better than me. Since spatial magic is considered a level higher than elemental magic, has high offensive capabilities, and is at the Archmage level.\"\nHe had gotten a feeling for it as he’d passed the training facilities, but as he thought, there were still several people who were well out of his league. Lee Shin Woo still didn’t understand how spatial magic worked in the least.\nWould he understand spatial magic, at least a little bit, if he absorbed the Bone Gate? But he couldn’t even get a feel of when that would be possible. It seemed like Prince was feeling that same uneasiness as well.\n\"...Will we be able to clear the final training facility, the one he planned out and created, and was then left for dozens of years to develop in an unfathomable way? Ouch!\"\n\"Doubts don’t help in the pursuit of magic. If you start to think negatively now, you’ll never be able to advance forward.\"\n\"My specialty is fighting, alright...!?\"\nIt seemed like that got a reaction out of her, as Prince quickly said softly, ’So you can leave the monsters to me’, and requested the monster information from Kratia.\nShe had boasted about how great and smart magicians were in the chatting channel, yet in front of Kratia, she couldn’t say a thing, which was both adorable and pitiable. It seemed as though Kratia was well aware of how nervous Prince was, as she firmly nodded her head and spoke.\n\"We’ll be stronger in that space, but the monsters and the magic traps will probably become even stronger. ...The biggest problem will be the monsters.\"\nWas she saying that there would be more than 100,000 monsters this time? Kratia explained to the anxious Lee Shin Woo and Prince.\n\"I think there are only three of them.\"\n\"...Shit.\"\nThey would’ve been like ’Oh, alright’ if she had said there were 30,000 of them, but there were only three? Lee Shin Woo said stiffly. ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ N0veI.Fiɾe.net\n\"If there is a level 8 monster...\"\n\"If that’s the case, then we should just blow up the facility and hope that the monster kills one of the 12 generals!\"\nPrince responded hysterically. Kratia smiled bitterly and explained.\n\"Don’t worry so much. The reason there were so many monsters in the previous facilities was because the space was warped and several monsters were led there.\"\n\"But it doesn’t seem like it’ll be that easy.\"\n\"Yeah. So...\"\nKratia undid the magic formula and explained it simply. Feotane Von Seldin gathered elite monsters from a few of the dungeons and left them in the final facility. The maximum number of monsters was limited to three, so the monsters would fight against each other and only the strong would’ve survived.\nAt this point, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the monsters created the training facility, not a magician! In any case, the monsters that had repeatedly fought against each other for dozens of years would be...\n\"They’re all level 7 elites. Each of them is probably as strong or stronger than the Metal Ape Chimera that you fought before.\"\nThere were three high rank level 7 elites that were proficient in combat and had spent dozens of years in a super dense mana zone. Even Lee Shin Woo would have to hesitate with those odds. Taking down a general might be easier.\nNo, he had already thought that when he had fought against the tens of thousands of level 6 monsters.\n\"...I’ll go.\"\n\"You can’t win as you are. That’s why I’m planning to use the magic traps.\"\nKratia said, and both Prince and Lee Shin Woo tilted their heads as though they couldn’t understand at first. However, Prince soon shook her head and yelled.\n\"The magic traps are aiming for us!\"\n\"My plan is to turn those magic traps onto the monsters. If that happens, then there’s definitely a chance we can win. No, actually, it may be our easiest win yet.\"\n\"That isn’t even possible! Fine, so you defeated the level 7 monster before. Let’s say that you could do it because you’re a level 7 magician and Lee Shin Woo has that unbelievable stamina and skill. But you want to take on three of those monsters at the same time? You’re going to use those magic traps, which are meant to kill us, on the monsters?!\"\n\"If you don’t want to do this, you can stay out of it.\"\nOf course, it may be a bit more difficult, but Prince wasn’t necessary for their plan. Prince looked at Kratia, who spoke so positively, and became even more despondent.\n\"You can relax a bit, you know. You’re already plenty str... From my point of view, you’re so strong that I can’t understand it. If there’s an insurmountable wall, can’t you just go somewhere else, and slowly and safely build your strength?\"\n\"If you don’t want to do this, you can stay out of it.\"\nKratia declared once more. It was an obvious reaction, as she had never thought that they wouldn’t be able to clear the training facility.\nHowever... Lee Shin Woo couldn’t figure out where her overflowing confidence was coming from. Perhaps it was because it was a magic training facility, but once she had returned here, it seemed like there were a lot of things on her mind, so he asked Kratia.\n\"Kratia, I can understand you wanting to hack the magic traps. But there are so many magic traps, so how are you going to...\"\n\"Rem.\"\n\"Mm... Ah.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nKratia said briefly, and Prince couldn’t understand her at all, but... at that moment, it looked like Lee Shin Woo had figured out the answer. In fact, he questioned why he hadn’t thought of that.\n’Is it possible, Rem?’\n’I told you before that there were several magic traps that used a golem’s system. Of course, there are several of them that do not use such a system, so I cannot do it by myself. However...’\nRem looked at Kratia and confidently nodded its head.\n’If that human helps, then... Yes. It’s certainly possible. But I think that we need to see if we can work together first.’\n’Alright.’\nLee Shin Woo slightly nodded his head and Rem flew from Lee Shin Woo’s shoulder to Kratia’s. Once she realized that, Kratia nodded her head in satisfaction and stood up.\n\"I’ll practice and come back. In about three days.\"\n\"Ok, I trust you. My horse and I have to train from the beginning anyway.\"\n\"Wait, what’s going on? What is a Rem anyway? What, is that some sort of code that only you guys know about or something?\"\n\"Senior.\"\nKratia and Rem went back to the facilities that they’d already cleared, and after he saw them off, Lee Shin Woo calmly called for Prince.\n\"I will help you so that we clear the training exercise and you reach level 7. ...In exchange, I would like you to draw up a contract with me.\"\n\"W-What’s with this all of a sudden! Did you use your magic on her!?\"\n\"It’s not really a tough contract, Senior.\"\nPrince saw Lee Shin Woo, who suddenly changed his attitude and was approaching her, and yelled in fear.\n\"I-I’m saying this in advance, but I have someone I like already, so...!\"\n\"Yes, I know already, so don’t worry. Then, shall we start with a privacy clause, Senior?\"\nHe smiled gently and said. Lee Shin Woo’s hand was covered in darkness mana. It seemed like Prince had instinctively felt the darkness, as she began to shake! Lee Shin Woo thought that this would be a pretty good way of making every hero be on his side, and smiled once more.\nThirty minutes later, their contract was safely established.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 28 part9",
    "content": "<Chapter 28. Kratia’s Quest - 9>\nThe promised three days had passed. During that time, Lee Shin Woo had run throughout the facility with Jin while activating his Assimilation skill so that they could match each other’s senses; because of that, Lee Shin Woo was just about able to match Jin’s dynamic visual acuity and reflexes, both of which stemmed from his agility.\n’In terms of this, you’re better than most level 7s.’\n’But Rebellion increases my max stats during battle. I have to be able to adapt to that quickly.’\n’That’s true.’\nFighting back against their current illogical situation was enough for the Rebellion skill to activate, which would result in a stat increase. Now that the Rebellion skill was level 4, all his stats increased by 16%. This was the amount of stat increase that Lee Shin Woo was used to now.\nHowever, if he were to face more than 1,000 enemies, or a higher level enemy, his Rebellion skill would activate and increase his stats by another 16%, as well as an additional 11% due to the existence of a partner.\nHis stats would increase by another 27%. Of course, that entire effect would be shared with his partner, so Jin would be reinforced equally.\n’Mm, it should all work out. Anyway, my goal is to gather as much mana as possible to strengthen my body, as well as to unleash a powerful attack.’\n’...Yeah, we can do it. I haven’t been just sitting around all this time either.’\nNo matter how strong the level 7 elites were, could they be stronger than Hansen Von Dorthe? Of course, it was scary that they had to fight against three level 7 elites at the same time, but Lee Shin Woo decided to trust Kratia. Prince, who was close to level 7, wasn’t very reliable, but he still took her into account too.\nOnce they had finished up their training, Lee Shin Woo and Jin returned to the designated meeting place. Kratia and Rem had already returned and were waiting for them.\n\"Do you think it’ll be ok?\"\n\"Yep.\"\nShe responded confidently and stuck out her chest. Rem sat atop Kratia’s shoulder with a similar pose. It seemed like they had formed a sense of kinship from collaborating for three days.\n\"A level 6 golem... A golem that pledges loyalty to a hero... A golem that can meddle with another golem’s structure... A golem that doesn’t even make any sense...\"\n\"You keep adding ’golem’ to your sentences, Senior. Are you alright?\"\n\"Do I look ok to you? I’m not in the right state of mind right now. I’m scared of the training exercise, and I’m even more scared of you.\"\nIt seemed like she hadn’t slept well, as there were large, dark circles under her eyes. Then again, it was right before D-Day, and she should’ve just finished with her last minute training, so it was kind of obvious that she’d be tired.\n\"As expected of you, Senior. It should’ve been a hard decision to make, but you came to a decision all on your own.\"\n\"Hmph, I’d rather die than be beaten by fledgling juniors!\"\nLee Shin Woo decided to respect how Prince would do whatever it took to maintain her pride as a senior.\nMoreover, he was could tell that she hadn’t stayed just because of her inferiority complex. Even if she attempted to not show any signs of it, Lee Shin Woo and Kratia could tell that Prince was worried about them. No... it was more accurate to say that she didn’t want to see another ’hero’ die.\n\"Then, let’s get through this and get to level 7.\"\n\"How would I feel any better if you were to reach level 7 at the same time as me... Hmph, if you don’t do it properly, then I’ll teach you lesson.\"\nPrince shared a few minor facts with him (she knew that he could somewhat control elemental power, and that Rem was his subordinate) and it seemed like she had given up on understanding him about half way.\nDespite that, it was cute that she still considered him a junior that she needed to look after. As he thought, she’s a good person. He felt a bit sad that he couldn’t tell her about him being an undead.\n’Well, as long as she’s a beautiful girl.’\n’I told you, that’s not how it is.’\nJin reacted ridiculously and scorned him, but Lee Shin Woo asserted that it wasn’t like that, and joined up with the group. Now there was nowhere to hide. It was time for them to finish this and clear the magic training facility that the Royal Magician Leader, Feotane Von Sledin, had put his heart and soul into.\n\"We’re going in. Is everyone ready?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nLee Shin Woo checked that his six Breath of the Lightning Gods, two of which were in his hands, were fully charged, and replied. Seeing that, Prince trembled once more, but she didn’t retort; it was as though she had given up.\n\"Good. I’m all ready too. We need to get the drop on them. I’m going to seize control of all the magic traps from the get go. Our enemies probably won’t be restrained by the rules, so we shouldn’t worry about them either.\"\n\"You’re just going to destroy everything, aren’t you.\"\n\"Yeah. So long as we can win that way.\"\n\"Defense... defense...\"\nIf Lee Shin Woo’s job was to fight against the monsters, and Kratia’s job was to seize control of the magic traps, then Prince’s job was right in the middle.\nHer job was to protect them against any unforeseen attacks, or from the magic traps that Kratia couldn’t control. It definitely wasn’t an easy task, but Prince steeled herself. If she couldn’t do this, then she didn’t deserve to reach level 7.\n\"Then... let’s go in.\"\n\"Alright, let’s go in together.\"\nThey formed a single group and entered the building. Of course, once they entered, they were met by a vast environment that couldn’t be called a building. And like Kratia had said, it seemed like the space was significantly reduced compared to the previous facilities.\nIt was a forest lined with trees. The group was pressed down by the ridiculously dense concentration of mana, which made them unable to breathe for a moment.\n[Assessing atmosphere. Mana concentration at 1,876%.]\n\"Ha, haha...\"\nPrince breathed out unnecessarily at Rem’s report. It would be hard to use magic when the concentration of mana was doubled, but 1,876% was ridiculous.\nOf course, if one were actually able to use magic in these conditions, then it would be quite an achievement, but if they were going to do that, then they wouldn’t have to go through all the effort of adapting to this level of mana concentration!\n’The mana concentration in the twenty-first facility was high as well. It wasn’t this unbelievably high, but... I can still do it!’\nPrince gritted her teeth, and the moment she raised her level 4 fire spirit staff, a voice rang out throughout the vast but small space.\n[The training exercise will begin soon.]\n\"Don’t listen to that thing anymore. Because it’s already started.\"\nThe voice rang out, as if to put their minds at ease, but Kratia curtly denied its validity.\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo had realized that as well. He had already felt it through his connection with Jin. The gaze of three fierce beasts looking right at them. Each of them were concealing their presences, but they couldn’t hide from Jin’s senses.\n’Jin, it may be a bit tough, but endure it. If it all goes to plan, then... we’ll be able to win easily.’\n’Alright. That’s always how it is. I trust you.’\nLee Shin Woo activated Lightning Shadow and Lightning Sprint simultaneously. The lightning was wilder than usual and enveloped both Lee Shin Woo and Jin in an instant; it was so dense that no one could see them from beyond the lightning.\n\"Keuk, Kuu.\"\n[Koo...]\n\"It’s coming!\"\nThen, Lee Shin Woo heard the beast’s subdued voice and directed Jin to run quickly. At the same time, Kratia’s orb gathered the ambient mana in the air, created a giant ice spear and shot it in Lee Shin Woo’s direction!\n\"Run!\"\n\"Heuuuup!’\nBefore the magic traps ahead of him activated, Kratia sucked out their mana, nullifying the traps, and simultaneously, attacked the first appearing level 7 with the ice spear.\nIts body, covered in crocodile skin and its saw-like teeth made it look like Godzilla. It was pretty small, but even Lee Shin Woo couldn’t measure the mana it held within!\n[Lv7 Croc Eranta]\n[You are facing a higher leveled foe! Through the activation of the Rebellion skill, all stats increase by 16%. Due to your partner, which you share everything with, all stats increase by an additional 11%, and all of these effects are shared with your partner as well!]\n[Kahk!]\nThe crocodile, which had assumed a charging position, suddenly stood upright and dodged the ice spear, but it couldn’t dodge Lee Shin Woo’s strike that came falling from the sky. It was a perfect combination attack with Kratia!\n\"Heup!\"\n[Kuuuu...!]\n\"Tch...!\"\nDespite taking Lee Shin Woo’s strongest Bursting Thunder attack, all it did was utter a small cry. It was fundamentally different from monsters that thought that their voices needed to be loud to win, like the Metal Ape Chimera, or the Treasure Eater (the Shriek of the Dead).\nIt truly was a beast that knew how to kill someone on the battlefield. It handled the damage from the attack (that came from the impact) differently than other monsters.\n\"Hoo...!\"\n[Kit!]\nLee Shin Woo quickly led Jin and retreated. It charged at them with its sawteeth covered arm, but he shot the four Breath of Lightning Gods at it, which were standing by behind it.\nThey probably wouldn’t kill it, but they would temporarily stop it from doing anything!\n\"Hey, another one is coming!\"\nHowever, there was another monster coming at Lee Shin Woo, who was trying to land. It looked like a black leopard, but it was huge, and possessed eight legs covered in dragon scales.\nIt charged, enveloped in magic that possessed as much destructive power as Lightning Sprint!\n[Lv7 Ur Leon]\n\"I knew you would come that wa...\"\n\"Shin Woo, there’s a trap above you!\" Googlᴇ search NoveI~Fire.net\nThe magic trap that hid in the air activated at just the right time.\nKratia was facing off against the last remaining beast, so she couldn’t cover Lee Shin Woo. Prince hurriedly conjured up fire magic and shot it at the beast’s back, but it couldn’t penetrate the beast’s red magic armor!\n[Kyaat!]\nThe monster ignored Prince and rushed towards Lee Shin Woo. It knew just who it needed to hunt down first!\n\"Heup!\"\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t someone to take lightly. The overwhelming ambient mana wasn’t just reinforcing the magic traps and the beasts.\nDespite him just launching four of his weapons and blowing them up, he immediately summoned four more, threw them at the magic trap and exploded them. As if it were just a normal attack!\n\"Eat this!\"\n[Kuhwaaaaaaaahk!]\nSix Breath of the Lightning Gods blew up in succession, so the area was temporarily filled with lightning energy.\nLee Shin Woo drew in all of that energy, successfully concentrated all of it into a single sword and lunged at the Ur Leon that followed him from behind. He obviously used Shadow Horn as well. Its destructive capability was truly fearful, as the attack was infused with mana 18x its normal concentration.\n[Kiiiii!]\n\"And blow up!\"\nKwang! The sword that was deeply embedded in the black leopard’s forehead blew up! Sparks spattered everywhere and hit both Lee Shin Woo and Jin, but because they were covered by Lightning Sprint’s lightning, it actually strengthened them.\nThat’s right. Strengthened. Lee Shin Woo utilized his Absorb skill and drew all the lightning energy towards him. He was using the Absorb skill in earnest, as it would allow him to suck in the elemental energy of any element he could use.\n[Keut!]\n[Kihi!]\nBoth the crocodile... the Croc Erantu, and the black leopard, Ur Leon, were struck by the lightning. They saw Lee Shin Woo, who absorbed the lightning energy that filled their surroundings in such a short time, and came to a common conclusion.\nThe more time they gave him, the more of an advantage he had, as he would change more and more of the area’s energy into one favorable to him! They momentarily swapped glances and soon began to move. However, Lee Shin Woo had already summoned another Breath of the Lightning God.\n\"You’re too late!\"\nSo long as Lee Shin Woo possessed the Bone Armory skill and the mana in which to use it, he could always replace the equipment that was destroyed. And in this environment, which was filled to the brim with mana, Lee Shin Woo had more of an advantage than anyone...!\n\"Kuaaaaaaaaaaah!\"\nThe Croc Erantu shot out hundreds of teeth and attacked him, while the black leopard worked in tandem with it and stepped back. The moment Lee Shin Woo retreated, it would immediately attack him. They had good teamwork for beasts who usually fought against each other...\n\"Explode!\"\nBoom! This time, he blew up all six of his Breath of the Lightning Gods at once, and the lightning storm swept them away.\nThe Croc Erantu’s sawteeth were caught up in the lightning storm and fell to the floor. Jin then leapt over like lightning, and Lee Shin Woo, from atop him, summoned and shot a new Breath of the Lightning God from behind the black leopard and struck its head!\n[Ku... Kyaaaaaaahk!]\nThe black leopard rampaged about and tried to strike Lee Shin Woo with his front leg, but he had already landed somewhere else. The bright yellow lightning that covered his body made him look as though he had become a lightning spirit.\nIt was comparable to the speed he had when he had landed the final strike against the Metal Ape Chimera.\n\"Hoo, hoo...!\"\n\"How about it? Do you think you can do it?\"\nJin asked briefly. Within the maelstrom of mana, Lee Shin Woo felt the necessary balance between Lightning Shadow and Lightning Sprint and smiled faintly. It had been 5 minutes since the battle had started, but it felt like his body would explode from absorbing and expelling so much mana. ...But despite that, there was also something that he’d gained.\n\"Sure I can.\"\nJin moved his body once more. In response, the crocodile and the black leopard moved to intercept them, but Jin gradually ran faster.\nAs they gave chase, Lee Shin Woo summoned the Breath of the Lightning Gods everywhere and exploded them; like the name might imply, they breathed out a ton of lightning!",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 28 part10",
    "content": "<Chapter 28. Kratia’s Quest - 10 [End of Volume 6]>\nThe moment he had realized that their final battlefield was an environment overflowing with mana, Lee Shin Woo really only had one strategy.\nHow would he gain superiority over the level 7 elites, who could use that magic better than him... Lee Shin Woo came to the conclusion that he would just have to change that mana into something he could control better than them.\n’The moment my weapons, which are infused with elemental power, blow up, they release that element’s mana into the area.’\nHe was filling the Breath of the Lightning Gods to the brim, which possessed a level 6 lightning element (drawing in the ambient mana and fully infusing the Breath of the Lightning God only took about 0.2 seconds) and blowing it up, which was altogether quite effective. Because the mana concentration was 18x normal, they wouldn’t be able to withstand this.\nDuring the time that the Breath of the Lightning Gods affected the ambient mana, Lee Shin Woo would have greater mana control than the monsters.\nIf he repeated this process twice, four times, no an uncountable number of times, then he might be able to fuse together Lightning Shadow and Lightning Sprint again with the plentiful lightning in the environment!\nIn this world, only Lee Shin Woo was able to use this extremely temporary and effective ability, and was only able to do so in one place: the training facility. As a result, the technique he’d created was quite effective.\n[Kihiiihk...!]\n[Kureuahgagahk!]\n\"Heup!\"\nHe hadn’t really developed a new killer technique or prepared a trap in advance. He was merely manipulating the environment to one that was advantageous to him. With just that, Lee Shin Woo was able to take on two level 7 elites at once. Perhaps he had come to this realization much too late.\n’Just being able to use a high rank element gives you such a huge advantage.’\nWhenever he summoned and blew up a Breath of the Lightning God, the surrounding mana would be tinged with lightning. Thunderclouds formed, filling the battlefield. Originally, the forest’s mana had been advantageous to them. They had gotten so used to it that the Ur Leon and the Croc Erantu felt uneasy from the sudden change.\nNo, it was more than that. Whenever the two level 7s moved, strangely, the thunderclouds would damage them. Normally, they would be able to draw in the surrounding mana to recover from such grievous wounds, but the thunderclouds prevented that from happening.\n[Kwang!]\n[Kihik!]\nIn the midst of that, Lee Shin Woo exploded four new swords and inflicted more damage upon the two level 7s. Even the black leopard (Ur Leon), which would recover from any injuries it sustained, seemed to realize that it would have no mana left remaining if it continued to do so; therefore, it adjusted its strategy and stopped healing its wounds immediately.\nThey realized that the situation had become disadvantageous for them and that they would have to escape from this area. If they were to escape from the thundercloud-filled area, then they would be able to heal their wounds immediately, as well as give them a chance to turn things around! If not, then they would buy time by allowing their comrade to be killed first.\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo couldn’t just let them go.\n\"If you leave, then I’ll kill this guy.\"\n[Keuuk!]\n[Kihi...!?]\nIn the beginning, the two had exchanged blows with Lee Shin Woo, yet at some point, they had become wary of each other and had been fighting whilst looking for an opportunity.\nOf course, their nimble and soft strikes had enough force behind them to kill him, but in this close battle, Lee Shin Woo evaded even quicker, attacked even stronger, and mustered up all of his strength!\n[Clear. Attacking the enemy with the 378th trap.]\n\"Hoo, Hoooo.... It’s not... perfect yet.\"\n[Sureureureu]\nOn the other hand, Kratia, who was responsible for hacking the magic traps and taking care of the final level 7 elite, was quite even with her opponent.\nShe activated her orb, gathered the ambient mana, and halted the elite’s movements. Also, Rem assisted her in hacking into the magic traps and directing them at the level 7 elite!\n[Shaaaaaah!]\n[Lv7 Emperor Boa]\nIn terms of size, the snake was the largest of the three monsters. Unfortunately, it possessed ice resistance, and Prince, who had originally assisted Lee Shin Woo in fighting off the two elites, had ultimately been forced into doing her utmost to stop its approach.\n\"Ugh, Fire Demon’s forearm! Hey, is my junior ok?\"\n\"Shin Woo is... a lot better off than us!\"\nKratia continued with her headache inducing calculations and struggled to reply. There were some magic traps that she couldn’t control, even with Rem’s help, so once she was finished analyzing them, she would immediately disarm them. On the other hand, for the magic traps she could control, she would control in conjunction with her orb to attack the boa, which was incredibly difficult.\n[Shaaaaaaaahk!]\n\"Geuut...!]\nBecause the orb’s frost attacks were almost meaningless against the boa’s ice resistance, she had switched over to defense a long time ago. Rather, Prince’s fire magic was incredibly effective against the boa and was even able to stop its advance, while occasionally damaging it. It made Kratia feel like she could just back off.\nKratia seized that opportunity and attacked the boa with the traps: the skewer, the poison arrows, giant boulders, being pressed down by gravity, etc., increasing its wounds!\n[Shah, Shaaaaaht!]\nThe sight of hundreds of magic traps being commanded by a trainee (who was the original target of the traps) simultaneously aiming at the monster and attacking it was truly a spectacular sight.\n\"Just a little bit more and we can take it down!\"\n\"He’s in the middle of preparing a large scale technique... Stop him in any way possible!\"\n\"Don’t ask for the impossible...!\"\nValidating Kratia’s words, the Emperor Boa spewed out a huge amount of poison mist from its body, attacking everything at once.\nThe ridiculous concentration of poison even contaminated the magic itself, nullifying all the magic traps in the area. It had simultaneously eliminated Kratia’s avenue of attack while attempting to poison them!\n\"Tch... Fire Demon!\"\nHowever, poison was weak to fire. Because she had been fighting for so long, Prince had become a bit more used to the high concentration of mana, which enabled her to immediately gather clean mana into her body. She then used her teacher’s ultimate move: summoning a fire demon!\n[Kureuk... Kyaha! Kureureureureureureureuk!]\n[Guooooooh!]\nA giant circular gate formed in the sky, and from that gate, a demon’s head popped out. Its emergence burnt the trees to a crisp, and it seemed to look around for a moment. Then, once it saw the Emperor Boa’s poison mist, it grinned and breathed out towards it.\nThe deep purple mist was evaporated instantaneously, and the Emperor Boa’s body was actually enveloped in flame!\n\"If you could do that, then why didn’t you use it earlier!?\"\n\"This is my first time using it, and I was barely able to do it. Barely!\"\nKratia griped with wide-eyes, and Prince responded angrily.\nHonestly, Prince had only learned the technique and had never even thought of using it before. If it wasn’t for this unique environment, then she would’ve only been able to barely cast the spell after she’d become a high rank level 7, and gathered various materials for ten days.\n[Kihik! Kihiiiiiiik!]\n\"Anyhow, this is our chance! Give it everything you got!\"\n\"I know...!\"\nKratia realized that they had to finish this and absorbed the orb into her body, which had been condensing mana.\nRem plopped off her shoulder and used the still-functional magic traps to attack the boa. As a result of her casting a spell she wasn’t ready for yet, Prince had a splitting headache and her body burned. She gritted her teeth and endured, ordering the fire demon to push on so that the boa couldn’t move!\n[Kureureuraaaaaaaaaaa!]\n[Kihiiiiiii!]\n\"Heup...!\"\nThe Emperor Boa was immobilized by the fire demon’s hellfire. But they didn’t know how much longer the demon would last. If they wanted to end it, now was the time!\nKratia focused her power into a singular object, forming a gigantic spear in the air. She gripped it tightly with one hand, pulled it back, and then, the spear began to shake and rotate.\nThe faster the rotation, the more intense the cold. If the Emperor Boa wasn’t affected by cold, then she just needed to use a temperature low enough that would!\n\"Wrath... of the Winter Queen!\"\nKratia focused all of her body’s mana into her fist and it seemed to gush out, but then, the rotating, midair ice spear absorbed it. At that moment, the ice spear shot out like lightning, passing the fire demon and destroying both the boa’s head and tail!\n[Kihik, kihiiii...!]\nThe Emperor Boa couldn’t maintain its weight and gruesomely fell to the ground. It had been burnt by flame and ice coated its body, making its corpse look really unsightly. Fortunately, it didn’t last for very long and disappeared... It had only left a few pieces of loot on the ground.\n\"It’s over, Rem!\"\n[Checking for any remaining magic traps! Marking magic traps...!]\n\"...Ha!\"\nThem taking down the Emperor Boa gave Lee Shin Woo the signal to counterattack.\nThe moment that the Emperor Boa (it was the strongest of the three), which had survived in the facility with them for dozens of years, perished, the Ur Leon and the Croc Erantu felt an unbearable unease and their bodies went stiff. There had been a balance between the three, as they kept each other in check, but the moment that that balance was broken, Lee Shin Woo shot out like lightning and thrust his sword into the Croc Erantu’s head once more.\nOf course, it wouldn’t die from just this, but Lee Shin Woo wasn’t normal either.\n\"Taste the breath of the lightning god!\" Official source ıs NoveI~Fire.net\n[Kuhak, Kuguhaaaaaaahk!]\nAfter he’d stuck the Breath of the Lightning God into the croc’s head, he stretched out his hand and placed it onto the perforated area; he then repeatedly summoned Breath of the Lightning Gods and shot them at it. It was an unbelievable continuous attack that was only possible in this training facility overflowing with mana!\nAt least a dozen blades were burrowed into the croc’s head, making its mind dim. While Lee Shin Woo continuously attacked with the Breath of the Lightning Gods, the black leopard took that opportunity to strike. But as it pounced, Lee Shin Woo blew up all the swords without hesitation!\n[You faced two higher level foes and have succeeded in defeating one! All stats have increased by 3. High Rank Lightning has become Lv4, and Magic has increased by 20!]\nHe simultaneously blew up all the weapons in a single area, and the resulting lightning energy was so powerful that the Croc couldn’t even utter a word and disappeared on the spot. The lightning energy, which had burst out from the Croc’s body, remained chaotic!\n[Kaha!]\nThe Ur Leon was sure that it would lose if it tarried, so it charged in immediately. It took advantage of the inevitable gap in Lee Shin Woo’s defenses that resulted from using a huge technique, so Lee Shin Woo couldn’t evade!\nHowever, the Ur Leon would soon realize that its efforts were pointless. It had seen through Lee Shin Woo with its senses as a level 7 and had attacked with a speed that Lee Shin Woo couldn’t match...!\n[Kuhu?]\nBut the moment the Ur Leon attempted to find Lee Shin Woo’s location and attack, a golden crack appeared on its body.\nThe crack formed starting from the top of its head, all the way down to its eight legs... It looked like a beautiful tattoo and made those witnessing the battle watch in awe.\n[Kihi...]\nThe Ur Leon didn’t realize what had happened and tried to retreat, but at that moment, the black leopard’s ears, eye sockets, jaw, torso, arms, fingers, and legs were broken up, and it fell to the ground.\nIt was a futile and cruel death.\n[You faced two higher level foes simultaneously and succeeded in defeating them. All stats have increased by 5! Proficiency in all combat-related skills has increased significantly!]\n\"...Hoo.\"\nLee Shin Woo appeared beyond the falling body of the Ur Leon and let out a deep breath. Fortunately, he was able to use the technique one more time at the end.\nOf course, he hadn’t been able to acquire it as a skill yet, but compared to a few days ago, he was confident that he’d gotten a step further. Why? Because...\n\"!? W-What was that just now!? What!?\"\n\"What do you mean? It’s just high-speed movement.\"\nBecause he could use Jin for this technique as well.\n\"It seems like a technique that works by temporarily changing both the interior and exterior into lightning. In other words, our bodies and minds become one.\"\n\"One in body and mind...\"\nFor some reason, he wasn’t happy, even though they had asked exactly what he had wanted to hear. This feeling that came from the technique was so strong that it was unbearable.\n[You have acquired 2,948,550 Perium.]\n[You have acquired 3,674,490 Perium.]\n[You have acquired the Lv7 Ur Leon’s big toenail.]\n[You have acquired the Lv7 Croc Erantu’s molar tooth.]\n[You have acquired the Lv7 Ur Leon’s outer shell.]\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo collected the loot and turned around, regardless of whether or not Jin understood how he felt. Fortunately, he got two bones from the Ur Leon, and couldn’t be happier.\n\"Kratia, are there any traps left?\"\n\"If we just disable the ones that are in our control, then...\"\nHowever, when Kratia was reporting on the situation while smiling bitterly at not having a chance to help out Lee Shin Woo...\nA huge crack appeared inside the training facility.\n[Hoh, hoh... As expected, how entertaining.]\nThe voice they heard at that very moment... Lee Shin Woo would probably never forget it.\n[I was wondering who it was, but... it turns out you were cute heroes.]\n\"...Huu.\"\n\"Oh... Shin Woo.\"\n\"What did I tell you, little lady.\"\nKratia called out to Lee Shin Woo, and Prince, unable to face the high level opponent, fainted. Jin was overwhelmed and couldn’t move, and in the middle of all that, Lee Shin Woo just sighed.\n[Lv8 Archmage Feotane Von Seldin]\nHe was an enemy they couldn’t hope to beat... One of the key members of the 12 generals had come to the training facility.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 29 part1",
    "content": "<Chapter 29. Level 7 - 1>\n’Who came up with the title of the 12 generals?’, he wondered. It was simple. It was the Emperor. Only those amongst his subordinates he specifically recognized would be bestowed that name. The Lightning Shadow General, Hansen Von Dorthe was the last of the 12 generals that were supposed to ’protect him’, and their status was one of respect.\nTherefore, their status was unique, so much so that they stood out amongst the other generals [1] and the nobles as well. They were more powerful than the others, even if they were similarly leveled, and the subordinates under their direct control were stronger than the others’ subordinates.\n[But there are a few amongst them that are especially powerful. The top members of the 12 generals... The sword that protects the Emperor, Seagald Von Retadane, the spear of the battlefield, Leofield Von Tariman... the Emperor’s shield, Arema Steelworker, and lastly, me, Archmage Feotane Von Seldin.]\nHe floated in the air, and his silk robes fluttered. Feotane looked like a handsome, young man, and spoke in a carefree, delighted tone.\nNo matter how Lee Shin Woo looked at it, he looked like a normal man, but the somber and dark energy that came from his body, as well as the fact that there wasn’t even a grain of life energy he could feel from him, proved that he was undead.\n[We are known as the four commanders of the Empire.]\nHe realized where Guillotine Steelworker had gotten the term ’Four Commanders’ from, grinned, and replied.\n\"For a self-introduction, you’re too loud.\"\n[I’ve finally met you ’heroes’, so if I don’t introduce myself properly, it would spoil the mood, wouldn’t it?]\nFeotane was really composed. It was the composure that came from being one of the absolute strongest.\nHansen Von Dorthe was somewhat the same, but ultimately, he was nothing more than vanity and conceit. On the other hand, the Archmage was so powerful that it explained his composure.\n\"You know about the heroes?\"\n[How could I not? Dozens of years ago, the heroes caused chaos in the capital... Ah, God truly is indifferent. Considering the fact that she ignores our feelings.]\n\"...\"\n[Ah, why the long face? I don’t hate heroes. His Imperial Majesty is the same.]\n\"What?\" ᴛhis chapter is ᴜpdated by novel{f}ire.net\nLee Shin Woo had secretly been preparing to escape while conversing with Feotane, but when he told him about his and the Emperor’s feelings on heroes, he gave an honest reply. Of course, this was also acting. He believed that this would cause Feotane to let down his guard.\n[You might think that we hate you because you kill our precious citizens, but... Ultimately, quality above quantity. High level heroes that are hand-picked by God due to their talent... If we can incorporate you into His Majesty’s forces, then we can endure that much heartbreak.]\n\"Incorporate heroes into his army? Says who?\"\n[Haha, it’ll happen eventually, no? So long as you are in the Empire, the only way of getting out is to die.]\nIt seemed as though Feotane Von Seldin really took a liking to Lee Shin Woo, as Lee Shin Woo didn’t just stiffen upon sight of him, plus he was responding confidently. Feotane smiled and was focusing all his attention upon him.\nFeotane knew that Lee Shin Woo had some trick up his sleeve, but he acted nonchalantly as if taunting him, saying ’go ahead, try it if you can’. If he knew exactly what Lee Shin Woo was planning, then he wouldn’t have remained so calm.\n[No one can escape death, so it was a game you had no hopes of winning from the very beginning. We have too great of an advantage. No... we made it that way. Mm, I’m referring to His Majesty and his wisdom.]\n\"Then, I suppose I just have to kill you all before I die.\"\n[No, you can’t. You will never be able to kill us.]\nFeotane said confidently, and Lee Shin Woo was vaguely aware of why he was so confident. He had surpassed life and death itself, and didn’t possess the energy that ’all existences naturally possessed’.\nEven if they could kill him, he wondered whether he would actually die or not... he inspected him meticulously and realized.\n’The core of this guy’s existence is... he doesn’t have a ’core’ that all existences possess. The root of his power, his stats, are hidden somewhere else. Holy shit, that ability’s actually possible...?’\nLee Shin Woo recollected a skill that black magicians rarely used in fantasy novels known as transmission. One’s life force would be extracted and would be transferred to another vessel; by hiding that container, the undead black magician would become immortal... He was a Lich!\nIf that’s the case, then the Emperor was probably a Lich as well. That meant that there were two Liches that had hid their containers somewhere! Right when Lee Shin Woo was genuinely shocked, the Archmage clapped his hands and moved on to the main topic of discussion.\n[Now, it seems like we’re done with the introductions, so shall we go on to the main topic?]\n\"Rem!\"\n[Stop right there.]\nLee Shin Woo turned to his comrades and was about to throw something, but at that moment, his body became stiff. Despite the deep concentration of lightning that continued to flow through his body, Feotane had frozen ’the entire space’ and made it so he couldn’t move.\n[I’m not done talking, young hero.]\n\"...\"\n[What’s in your hand? Hmm? What’s this, there’s nothing there. It looked like you were about to throw something. Was I just seeing things? In any case, it doesn’t matter. So, moving on to the main topic.]\nThe chatty Archmage looked like he couldn’t be happier, as he put his arm around Lee Shin Woo’s shoulders and continued. Lee Shin Woo couldn’t move. Regardless of how much mana he had, there was nothing he could do, as the entire space itself was frozen.\n’Rem, I’m counting on you.’\n’Activation is ready at any time.’\nThe only things he could do was to make use of the shared subspace function to secretly relay his message to Rem, who was perched atop Kratia’s shoulder, or use his Assimilation skill to apologize to his precious partner or activate a skill...\n[I told you this before, but we put more importance into quality over quantity. We wait until several heroes become strong enough to enter our ranks and then... when they are strong enough, we accept them into the fold. You will ultimately become our comrades, so we can give you important positions as well.]\n\"...\"\n[Therefore, I won’t kill you. It looks like you’re still level 6, so... Mm, indeed. It looks like you can still progress further. It’s strange, it’s like there’s something off balance with you. It’s not yet time to harvest. Isn’t that right? However, It seems like we can bring that beautiful magician girl with us soon... Huh?]\nHe tilted his head. Feotane had frozen both Kratia and Prince like he’d frozen Lee Shin Woo, but strangely, it felt like something had changed. However, he couldn’t tell what that was yet. It was as if there was a strange mana reaction...\n[Wait a sec... A gate!?]\n\"Heup!\"\nSuddenly, a gate appeared beneath Kratia and Prince’s feet... Because it was such high level magic, Feotane hadn’t expected it at all and was shocked. The moment he stretched out his hand, Lee Shin Woo used the only skill that he could use in this frozen space, Rule of Bone’s Self-Destruct skill.\n[Critical Hit!]\nHe had converted the entire area’s mana into lightning, so it would be effective against even the likes of a level 8 Archmage! ...Especially if both Lee Shin Woo and Jin were to sacrifice their bodies in the process!\n[Kuhahk!]\nThe Archmage was swept up in the blast, the huge explosion caused the entire area’s mana to shake. Feotane felt nauseous, as he hadn’t felt pain in such a long time, and hurriedly flew into the air; at that moment, Kratia and Prince had already disappeared. Of course, Lee Shin Woo and Jin’s appearances had disappeared as well due to the explosion!\n[How could this happen...]\nThe Archmage looked around, though there was nothing left inside, and muttered in shock. He had lived for quite a long time, but he wouldn’t be able to forget that attack. To think he would go as far as to sacrifice his horse as well to save his comrades!\nNo, what was even more surprising was the fact that his comrades could create a Gate and use it to escape, as well as the fact that he had been so grievously injured by a level 6 hero.\n[Let’s say that I sustained this much damage because it was Self-Destruct, but the gate... No, it’s possible to create a temporary gate if they used an item. Damn it, I can’t interfere with God’s subspace. Did God give them that item herself? They really got me!]\nEventually, he came to a reasonable conclusion. Honestly, the correct answer was that Lee Shin Woo told Rem that the Bone Gate was ready from his (Rem’s) inventory, and Rem had activated the gate underneath their feet, sending Kratia and Prince to another place, but he did come to a similar conclusion.\n[It’s been a long time since I’ve seen someone so talented that they could be a candidate for a general. I was going to recommend him to the 12 generals, but oh well.]\nTo make sure, Feotane used the artifact that was set up in this space and scanned the entire area, but there weren’t any traces of anyone remaining. He could truly say that they got him good.\n[Keuk. They got me. How long has it been... my wounds are worse than I expected. I have to go and treat them immediately.]\nHe muttered to himself and raised his head to gather mana, but the entire area’s mana was jumbled with lightning or chilly air, so there was nothing here he could use. If he wanted to restore his body (a Lich’s body), then elemental mana wouldn’t cut it. He needed pure mana.\n[Tch. I’ll treat myself and then come back...]\nIt seemed like he didn’t really like it, as he muttered and left.\nAt that moment, a torrent of mana swelled within the air, and Lee Shin Woo and Jin’s new bodies formed. It was truly a mysterious and frightening scene.\n[The Invisible Heart skill has become Lv4. All stats have increased by 3.]\nLee Shin Woo, who had been completely resurrected, saw that damn message, gritted his teeth, and muttered.\n\"Damn it, I promised myself that I would never die again...\"\n\"We got out of that situation alive, so it’s fine!\"\nLee Shin Woo and Jin’s Invisible Heart and Blessing of Death possessed a strange option, and whether this was good or bad, he didn’t know.\nLee Shin Woo and Jin could choose when they would revive, so long as it was within several minutes, and it really helped in situations like this, where dying just once wouldn’t let them overcome danger.\nEven now, the Archmage hadn’t realized that they weren’t really dead and had left the area!\n\"But what happened to Prince? I thought it’d be fine, so long as I could save Kratia and Rem. Wasn’t it limited to two?\"\n\"Is it really the time to curious about that? Let’s go. We have to go as fast as we can!\"\n\"Nope. Jin, we have to find something here before we leave.\"\n\"What exactly are you trying to find in this urgent situation... Hey, it’s not that, is it? Please tell me it’s not.\"\nJin had been pressing him, but when he saw Lee Shin Woo moving so quickly, he realized what the answer was and was shocked.\n\"Are you going to take that surveillance item!?\"\n\"Of course I am. Do you know why the Archmage wasn’t able to find us, even though he activated the artifact?\"\n\"I don’t know!\"\n\"Because Kratia succeeded in hacking into it! So if we can’t take that along with us, it would be such a waste that I would lose sleep over it!\"\n\"You can’t sleep, you’re undead!\"\n[Lv8 Huginn’s Eye] [2]\n\"I found it!\"\n\"Hey!\"\nWhen Feotane Von Seldin had activated the artifact at the very last moment, Lee Shin Woo had followed the flow of mana and realized where the artifact was hidden within the facility. Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t lose that artifact again, and the moment he greedily grasped it, Jin lifted him onto his back and ran out of the facility. At the speed of light!\nExactly 10 minutes later, Lee Shin Woo and Jin were completely healed from the injuries they’d sustained from Self-Destruct, while Feotane Von Seldin had also returned to the facility. He found that the artifact that controlled the facility was gone without a trace, and was shocked for the third time that day.\n[1] T/N: Apparently, I need to be more specific when referring to the 12 generals, as there are other generals in the Empire.\n[2] T/N: Reference to one of Odin’s ravens from Norse mythology.",

    "content": "<Chapter 29. Level 7 - 2> Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn novel~fire~net\nWhen Kratia and Prince had escaped the Archmage’s spatial magic and were barely able to recognize their situation, they realized that they were inside of a dungeon they’ve never been in before.\n\"What exactly is going on...\"\n\"I don’t know either.\"\nKratia shook her head in response to Prince’s quivering voice. Of course, Kratia knew that Lee Shin Woo had activated the Bone Gate, but she had no intentions of explaining that to Prince. She wasn’t in the mood to anyway.\n\"That man... did he do this?\"\n\"Nope. ...Since he tried to kill me.\"\n\"...What about my junior?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Hey, I asked what happened to my junior!?\"\nKratia wanted to retort, ’And how the hell would I know?’, but she held herself back. It seemed like Prince was worried about Lee Shin Woo as well, so she just gave her a small hint.\n\"He’s probably alright.\"\n\"How do you know that!?\"\n\"Because it’s there.\"\nKratia said, and looked at Rem. Prince’s eyes went wide-open, as she hadn’t noticed Rem until now, and Rem reported mechnically.\n[Master is safe.]\n\"Right?\"\n\"H-How? No, it’s a relief that he’s alright...\"\nPrince was genuinely relieved. Kratia felt the same, but in a way, she felt a bit disappointed as well. The fact that Lee Shin Woo was able to safely escape from that situation meant that there was something that he hadn’t told her about.\n’...But what’s important is that Shin Woo’s alright. Jin is probably ok too.’\nLee Shin Woo never had to tell her everything. When she thought about it like that, she thought that she may have asked way too much of Lee Shin Woo before, or that she had improperly measured the distance between them. Perhaps that was inconvenient for him.\n\"Hoo...\"\n\"He’s safe, so why do you look so down?\"\n\"Relationships are harder to figure out than magic...\"\n\"Where is this coming from!?\"\nPrince and Kratia had recovered from their initial shock from meeting the Archmage, and when they had managed to barely straighten themselves out, Lee Shin Woo and Jin entered the dungeon they were in.\nThey had realized this through Rem flapping its wings and flying towards Lee Shin Woo.\n\"You’re all alright.\"\n[Master!]\n\"Yeah, it’s a relief that you’re safe as well.\"\n\"Junior!?\"\n\"Shin Woo!\"\nLee Shin Woo, who had reclaimed Rem, moved the Bone Gate that was in Rem’s inventory back into his own. In the process, he noticed the Bone Gate could now transport three people at a time.\nAs expected, absorbing bones allowed the temporary activation of the Bone Gate, but it also permanently strengthened it as well. When he thought about it like that, it really wasn’t any different from his other bone equipment.\n\"It’s actually a relief that I fed it so much...\"\n\"Junior!\"\n’Because of that, I was able to save Prince as well,’ he muttered in satisfaction. Then, someone rushed over to him, which turned out to be Prince. Her eyes were brimming with tears.\n\"I’m so glad you’re alive. It’s such a relief! Huuuu...\"\n\"Uh... I’m glad you’re safe too, Senior.\"\nIn Lee Shin Woo’s original plan, Prince wouldn’t have been saved, but it seemed like she believed that Lee Shin Woo had staked his life on saving her. It was a blow to his conscience, but right now, he needed to come out strong!\n\"You sent us over here, right? That consumable must’ve been really expensive! I thought you were a good guy before, but it turns out you really are!\"\n\"Ha, haha...\"\nIt seemed like Prince had come to the same conclusion as Feotane Von Seldin. Lee Shin Woo decided not to correct her misunderstanding and laughed with uncertainty. Though her face was a mess, Prince beamed. She was the type of person who cried with a runny nose when she was relieved and touched; he couldn’t say he hated that type of person.\n\"But it wasn’t free.\"\n\"Huh!?\"\n\"I’ll collect on your life debt later. Isn’t that how it works?\"\nLee Shin Woo said and grinned. Then, Prince, who had been grabbing onto his arm, loosened her grip on his hand, paled, and stepped back. It seemed like she was making an even larger misunderstanding.\n\"I-I told you I have someone I like.\"\n\"I know. Hahaha.\"\nWhile Lee Shin Woo teased Prince to no end, Kratia quietly came over and held onto Lee Shin Woo. There was a lot she wanted to ask him, but right now...\n\"Shin Woo, I’m glad you’re alright.\"\n\"Yeah. Thanks, Kratia. Let’s talk later.\"\n\"...Ok.\"\n\"...\"\nOn one side, there was Prince, and on the other, he was speaking with Kratia. Seeing that, Jin felt extremely uncomfortable.\nJin had died and revived with Lee Shin Woo, but he didn’t really want to be complimented for that. But as a result, Lee Shin Woo was surrounded by women and was being thanked by them, which pissed him off!\nBut no matter how pissed he was, or how much he much he scraped the ground with his feet, Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t understand how he was feeling.\n\"Your horse is ok too. You really are amazing to have escaped with your horse intact.\"\n\"You see, I have an escape skill. I received it from God’s garden.\"\n\"At this point, I have no idea how many skills you actually have.\"\nWas it because she had been so terrified and was released from that fear? Prince had momentarily let go of her stubbornness and was genuinely in awe of him. Lee Shin Woo just smiled beamingly. If he was honest with her, she would faint.\nFor a while, he continued to chat with them, and now that everyone was safe and sound, he said.\n\"Then let’s split up now.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Mm...\"\nIt seemed obvious. They had coincidentally met Prince at the training facility, and now that they had somehow escaped that same facility, there was no reason for them to stay together anymore. However, Prince looked somewhat anxious at his sudden declaration.\n\"But that guy...\"\n\"He shouldn’t be able to follow us anymore, even if he’s an Archmage who specializes in spatial magic. And if he does come for us, we wouldn’t be able to beat him, even if we were together.\"\n\"L-Let’s join up with Lloyd’s group first. You’re at our level now, so if we all travel together, then we have nothing to fear...\"\n\"It wouldn’t be beneficial for our growth if too many heroes banded together. It’s unfortunate, but we should work together next time, Senior. There’ll definitely be a day when we work together again. Like when we face one of the 12 generals.\"\n\"Ugh...\"\nPrince looked as though she never wanted them to part. Well, he could definitely understand why she felt that way. They had barely come out of a situation where they could’ve died at any time, so anyone would feel that way.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo didn’t have the time to babysit a kid forever. Therefore, he should just flat out refuse and send her away.\n\"Oh right. A life debt. You said you would collect on my life debt!\"\n\"I’ll collect on it later. If we meet again later.\"\n\"Tch!\"\nIn the end, Prince realized that she wouldn’t be able to convince Lee Shin Woo, pouted, and stepped back. She dried her tears and blew her nose on the handkerchief.\n\"So you’re saying you won’t let me be a part of your group. It makes me feel cheap, so I’m going. I’m not going to play with you guys anymore.\"\n\"Brat.\"\n\"Let’s meet again someday, Senior. I hope you stay safe till then.\"\n\"...Hmph. Make sure you don’t die to idiots! And you too. Next time my magic will be much greater than yours!\"\nIt seemed as though Prince was really pissed, as she stomped the ground as she left the dungeon. Even until the end, she was cute. Once they could no longer see her, Jin kicked Lee Shin Woo with his front legs. It was quite the serious hit.\n\"Hey, what’s wrong!?\"\n\"It just pissed me off seeing you flirt with a girl at such a crucial time.\"\n\"Wait, what? What did I do...!?\"\n\"I agree with Jin.\"\n\"Like I said, what did I do?\"\nLee Shin Woo was punished by Kratia and Jin for teasing Prince too much. He waited for them to calm down, then explained to Kratia how exactly they had survived.\nIn exchange for becoming a skeleton, he told her that he was able to revive himself a few times, and Kratia accepted it. She had forgotten because Bone Reinforcement was such a cheat skill, but being an undead was truly a huge penalty.\n\"It’s an ability that I can’t comprehend...\"\n\"But I think I understand it a little better now.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nLee Shin Woo recollected the walking disaster, the Archmage Feotane Von Seldin. Of course, the Archmage’s overwhelming magic, his ability to control space, or his ability to freeze space left a lasting impression on him, but there was something he had paid special attention to...\n’A Lich’s ability to extract their life force and store it in a safe place. Perhaps...’\nPerhaps Invisible Heart was similar?\nIf it was, then he could understand how Invisible Heart fundamentally worked. However, that power was still beyond Lee Shin Woo’s grasp, but he was certain that that power was deeply linked with him.\nIt was as if Feotane Von Seldin’s body and container were connected by a powerful magic string!\n’My priority should be to not die and keep increasing the maximum limit of Invisible Heart.’\nNot only did he not understand how a Lich resurrected itself, but he also didn’t know much about the Invisible Heart either. There was a chance that these skills weren’t even closely related at all, but even if they were, he had no guarantee that he would be able to use the skill as he wished.\nBut if he were to compare himself now with when he first started and couldn’t do anything, his current situation was much better. Humanity’s strength is being able to push themselves again and again, so long as their path is clear.\n\"Would I be able to help you?\"\n\"I’d really appreciate it if you did. Now’s not the time though.\"\nLee Shin Woo patted Kratia’s shoulder, who spoke with limpid eyes. For some reason, he felt as though they had gotten even closer and he could trust her even more now.\nPerhaps she was thankful that he’d used one of his lives to save her. To be honest, he’d increased the maximum level of Invisible Heart a few times now, so he still had more than 100 lives left!\n\"Then, shall we return to our base?\"\n\"Ok. If we’re going to be doing anything, then I’d like to rest a little first.\"\nOriginally, he hadn’t planned on accompanying Kratia anymore, but he decided to return to his base with her. Even if he acted otherwise, they had faced off against one of the 12 generals who happened to be level 8, so they were all extremely tired.\nThey needed to rest, if for no other reason than to get to their next destination. Because he had used Invisible Heart, he only needed 10 more stats to get to level 7, so he would level up in a safe location and then act.\n\"Ah, and I also have to fix the artifact too.\"\n\"The artifact? ...You didn’t... Kyaa!\"\nKratia hugged Lee Shin Woo excitedly, but Jin kicked her with his hind legs and sent her flying. Lee Shin Woo saw the two snarling at each other, and had no idea whether they had become friends or had become sworn enemies.",

    "content": "<Chapter 29. Level 7 - 3>\n\"Rem, what do you think?\"\n[It’s difficult. More research must be done.]\n\"Well, I didn’t think it’d work on the first try.\"\n[You can count on me.]\nLee Shin Woo left the magic device, Huginn’s Eye (which he’d stolen from the training facility), with Kratia and Rem. It was an absurd surveillance artifact, as it could sense multiple presences in a large area, and indirectly influence them as well. It was a level 8 item that was a treasure amongst treasures. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call it the core of the training facility.\nOf course, he wouldn’t likely be able to figure out everything that’s going on in the Empire with just this, but if he were to improve its performance, as well as limit its options in order to concentrate its abilities, then... Someday, he’d be able to tell the golems movements. Well, if it can synergize with Rem’s abilities that is.\n\"With this, the connection between Rem and the artifact is complete.\"\n\"That means...\"\n\"Yeah. Even if Rem’s far away, he can see with Huginn’s Eye.\"\nLee Shin Woo decided to leave Huginn’s Eye at his base. Firstly, they hadn’t improved Huginn’s Eye enough for them to properly use it. Secondly, it wouldn’t activate from his inventory and it took up too much space.\nLastly, with Kratia’s help, they were able to set up a communication line between Huginn’s Eye and Rem. Thus, Rem was able to utilize Huginn’s Eye from long range. For the time being, Kratia would study Huginn’s Eye and would strive to improve it, so it should be more useful in the future.\n\"But is it really ok with you? It feels like I’m just keeping you here...\"\n\"My original goal was the artifact. I’m happy that I can continue to study it.\"\nIt seemed like Kratia was quite satisfied. Then again, ever since she’d entered the Empire, Kratia hadn’t been concerned about heroes or the undead, but magic, so it seemed like the natural reaction from her...\n\"Plus, not only did my combat-related skills improve, but I learned a new skill related to the artifact. The more I study the artifact with that skill, the faster my magic will increase.\"\n\"Is that that amazing?\"\n\"...Shin Woo, you have no idea how amazing it is to learn a new type of skill.\"\nKratia’s eyes sharpenedfor some reason, so Lee Shin Woo apologized to her and decided to take a step back. He couldn’t understand it at all, as he gained skills so easily through Bone Reinforcement.\nBut the more skills one had, the more stats they’d gain, so he realized that the more skills one had, the more capable they were.\n\"That’s why the [elites] are so amazing. Normal monsters don’t really have any skills, and only have their stats to back them up, so we can hunt them easily, but... On the contrary, elites possess at least two or three skills on average, so not only do they get stronger the more they use their skills, but they’re able to properly exhibit their overwhelming strength (from their stats) through said skills.\"\n\"Well, that’s true...\"\nThere was an insurmountable wall (in terms of strength) between normal monsters and elites. Once he heard the clear reason between this divide, he found himself naturally nodding his head.\nIf he put what she said into consideration, then wouldn’t he become the strongest if he just lived a long time? The scary part was that the chances of that weren’t zero.\n\"But first...\"\nKratia seemed like she would talk about skills for a few hours, so Lee Shin Woo pushed her towards Huginn’s Eye. He gathered the last bones he’d acquired from the training facility and sighed in satisfaction.\n\"Let’s level up first.\"\n\"You don’t have any for me, right?\"\n\"I thought you wouldn’t want them, so I used them on myself... Are you disappointed? Should I give you one?\" The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the noᴠelfire.net\n\"It’s fine. I respectfully decline.\"\nBefore they had cleared the final training facility, Jin had absorbed an unimaginable quantity of bones and had grown tremendously. Moreover, he had also absorbed a level 7 elite’s bone, so he wanted nothing to do with bones for the time being. Lee Shin Woo decided to give him a break this time.\nAbove all, it was most efficient to use Bone Reinforcement prior to a level up. He had acquired four level 7 elite bones purely through luck, but it was still beneficial to him regardless; Lee Shin Woo decided to make this level up something special.\n’The Ur Leon’s big toenail and shell, the Croc Erantu’s molar, and the Emperor Boa’s fang I got from Kratia.’\nThey weren’t technically made of bone, but they were definitely considered bones.\nMoreover, they were from elite monsters that had fought for dozens of years inside of an area with a high concentration of mana, so they were higher quality than any of the level 7 elite bones he’d absorbed thus far. They were almost comparable to Hansen Von Dorthe.\n\"Hoo.\"\n\"Ugh.\"\nWould Jin be alright from absorbing the info from four bones simultaneously? Jin unnecessarily imagined himself absorbing those bones and shook, while Lee Shin Woo extended his hand and selected the bones. Then he said.\n\"Bone Reinforcement.\"\n[Consuming all four bones to execute Bone Reinforcement. Strength has increased by 20, Agility by 25, Health by 30, and Magic by 58.]\n[The Bone Reinforcement skill has become Lv10. Bones with intersecting memories are combined, allowing you to access complete memories. Verifying that all owners of these bones lived in the same environment, giving you access to their combined memories.]\n\"Mm.\"\nWhat a great time for Bone Reinforcement to level up. And it came with a new ability at that. Lee Shin Woo inwardly muttered that he hadn’t expected this to happen, but at that moment, a deluge of memories poured into his brain.\nLee Shin Woo gasped. It felt like his limits were being tested whenever he used this skill!\n\"Shin Woo!?\"\n\"It’s nothing. I’m fine.\"\nNew information that he could absorb because of Bone Reinforcement’s level up... it was a record of the countless battles that these monsters had fought within an artificially made subspace. They were born and grew up within that space of boundless mana; he saw their ability to adapt to their environment, as well as their aspirations, and thirst for vengeance!\nNo, there was something beyond that. These monsters had been shackled in this mana zone, which had given them their strength on a silver platter, for dozens of years, and their fundamental knowledge of spatial magic flowed into him!\n’By absorbing all three of their memories at the same time, I’m able to absorb dozens of years of their memories. This is ridiculous...’\nAbove all, Lee Shin Woo felt the flowing mana that accumulated more and more over the years, and it felt as though that mana actually moved through his body. In the end, it felt as though the boundary between his body and the world had disappeared.\nHe couldn’t describe that sensation. Lee Shin Woo just wanted to focus on that feeling. His body began to float into the air and started to reconstruct itself. While he absorbed the memories, he was leveling up!\n[You have undergone countless training and experiences, and have learned the basics to accepting and manipulating all the energy that exists in this world. Though you are still unskilled, each and every bone in your body breathes, and the resulting strength is nothing to scoff at.]\n[You have become a level 7 Breathing Bone Joker.]\nA Breathing Bone Joker. Did that mean a Joker whose bones breathed? He had gone from an Elemental Skeleton Joker, to a Powered Elemental Bone Joker and now, to a Breathing Bone Joker. The name was a joke, but he suddenly found that he liked it.\nThe term ’breathing’ made it feel like he had even more potential now, as he was originally an entity that couldn’t breathe. It felt like his hopes and dreams had been realized. It felt like it was teaching him what direction he needed to go from now on.\n\"Guaaaah...!\"\nOf course, the changes that came about due to a level up were just beginning.\n[The Element Absorption skill has become Lv7. Magic has increased by 50.]\n[The Intermediate Assimilation skill has become Lv8. Agility and Magic have increased by 10.]\n[The High Rank Mana Bone skill has become Lv3. Magic has increased by 60. You understand how mana functions in space, so you are now able to both control a portion of it and resist it. If someone tries to interfere with you with their magic, then you can use your magic to resist the effects.]\nThe skill that had been most affected by Bone Reinforcement was his Mana Bone skill. It was also the skill that was most affected by the ’breathing’ part of his level up. After all, his bones wouldn’t be able to breathe if he didn’t have the Mana Bone skill!\nThat wasn’t all. He now had extensive experience with spatial magic, so the Mana Bone skill overcame its previous limitations and increased its scope. It used the helplessness and frustration he felt while fighting Feotane Von Seldin as fuel to allow him to resist others’ magic! Was that the reason that his Mana Bone skill had leveled up twice in such a short time after reaching the high rank level?\n[The Bone Armory skill has become Lv9. Health and Magic have increased by 10. You can now summon eight pieces of equipment at a time. You can now replace any equipment mid-summon with another.]\n[The Rule of Bone skill has become Lv10. All stats have increased by 10. If it is a bone you can control, or even if it isn’t, you can control it and reinforce it.]\nRule of Bone and Bone Armory were affected quite significantly as well. Lee Shin Woo could not only use his mana more extensively now, but his overall ability to control bone had increased.\nHe was especially surprised by Rule of Bone’s level up. He could control bones that weren’t even his and could reinforce them as well. It was proof that Lee Shin Woo’s scope of influence had increased.\n[The High Rank Combat Sense skill has become Lv2. Agility has increased by 20. You can now more swiftly respond to any attacks using mana.]\n[The Intermediate Regeneration skill has become Lv10 and has evolved to the high rank level! Health and Magic have increased by 20. In the case of a mana based attack, you can collect a portion of the mana and activate Regeneration.]\nThat wasn’t all. It seemed like his other skills had been affected by his karma, as they leveled up as they pleased, and increased his stats as well. Whenever he leveled up, he felt like his body was boiling due to the dramatic changes in his stats (plus, there was the increased effectiveness of said stats).\nBut now that he could more naturally breathe mana, he was able to more naturally accept that change, and even though his body was seething, it felt as though he had just had a refreshing shower.\n\"Hooooo...\"\nLee Shin Woo very naturally breathed out. Of course, he couldn’t actually breathe, but his body followed his lead and absorbed a large quantity of mana, only expelling the mana that his bones couldn’t withhold.\nIn the process, the ambient mana was affected by him, and strangely, began to change. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say it was being influenced by him. It was like when he had blown up his lightning weapons to transform the surrounding mana into lightning. By continuing his breathing, the mana in the entire area would come under his control!\n\"A-An Archmage?\"\n\"There’s no way I’d become an Archmage.\"\nKratia had immediately noticed Lee Shin Woo’s change (that came about due to his level up), and her eyes went wide. Then, Lee Shin Woo grinned, shook his head, and checked his stats (which he hadn’t done in a long time).\n[Lee Shin Woo]\n[Breathing Bone Joker]\n[Corps Destroyer; 10 others]\n[Lv - 7 (Status effectiveness 250%)]\n[Strength - 1,421, Agility - 1,331, Health - 1,383, Magic - 2,637]\n[Passive skills - Acting Lv16, Invisible Heart Lv4, Rebellion Lv4, High Rank Bursting Thunder Lv2, High Rank Mana Bone Lv3, Intermediate Shadow Horn Lv4, Intermediate Command Lv9, Intermediate Assimilation Lv8, High Rank Combat Sense Lv2]\n[Active skills - Disguise Lv6, Instigate Lv6, Bone Reinforcement Lv10, Rule of Bone Lv10, Bone Armory Lv9, High Rank Regeneration Lv1, Sacrifice Lv1, Emergency Evasion Lv6, Intermediate Horn Gigantification Lv3, Beginner Shadow Extension Lv4, High Rank Lightning Sprint Lv2, Lightning Shadow Lv4]\n[Elements - Intermediate Fire Lv5, Intermediate Ice Lv5, High Rank Acid Lv2, High Rank Lightning Lv4, High Rank Darkness lv1, Absorption Lv7]\n[Resistances - Holy: MAX, Darkness: MAX, Acid: High Rank Lv2, Ice: Intermediate Lv3, Fire: Intermediate Lv3, Lightning: High Rank Lv2]\nNow he was finally at a pretty good level, with some respectable stats and skills. It was way too early to say that he was [complete], but... maybe this was the first step.\nA new level 7 hero had been born in the Empire.",

    "content": "<Chapter 29. Level 7 - 4>\nOnce Lee Shin Woo reached level 7, he was able to more easily control the surrounding mana through his mana breathing ability.\n\"Shin Woo, you’ve finally become a catalyst!\"\n\"Nah. I’m not at that level yet...\"\nKratia insisted that Lee Shin Woo’s body had become a catalyst and was even happier about it than him, but Lee Shin Woo calmly denied her assertion.\nOf course, his level up had drastically increased his control over mana, and he was somewhat able to draw and use the ambient mana around him. But after testing it out a few times, he realized that he wasn’t able to replicate Kratia’s Catalyst Magic yet.\n\"But you’ll get there eventually. Let’s study together.\"\n\"Nah, I’m not the studying type. I’ll try to figure it out in the field.\"\n\"Tch...\"\nKratia’s eyes became really sullen. She was so mature when they had first met, yet she seemed to act younger and younger as time went on. Was that just his misunderstanding? It was probably proof that she was opening up to him, but it honestly made him feel a bit uncomfortable.\n\"Well, we’ll be going now.\"\n\"See you later. I’ll make sure to give you updates.\"\n\"I’m counting on you.\"\nLee Shin Woo touched Huginn’s Eye for the last time, but he received a message that his Bone Reinforcement skill wasn’t at a high enough level yet to absorb it. He’d checked when he first stole the artifact and carried it out of the facility, but despite his level, as well as Bone Reinforcement’s level increasing, it was still beyond his reach.\n\"Is it a higher rank than the Bone Gate...?\"\n\"Your compatibility must not be great. If there comes a day that you can absorb this, then...\"\n\"I’ll leave it with you until that day comes.\"\n\"Ok.\"\nFinally, Lee Shin Woo gave Kratia a soft embrace and left the base with Jin. Rem came along with them of course.\n\"Shin Woo, you haven’t equipped your gear.\"\n\"Ah, that’s right. I’d forgotten that my gear was unsummoned as my body changed from the level up.\"\nIn the process of leveling up, his gear was released. Right now, Lee Shin Woo’s face had returned to that of a skeleton, but it was much whiter than when he had been a level 6, and even looked a bit transparent. It was proof that he was becoming more like mana.\nHe would elicit a response like ’H-He’s strong!’ from anyone now, as he looked like such a powerful skeleton. Lee Shin Woo was fine traveling like this, but Jin urged him to wear his gear, so he summoned and equipped it. It seemed like his equipment had improved as well, perhaps because Bone Armory had gone up to level 9.\n\"You don’t need to go to the shop this time?\"\n\"Mm, I’d like to sell my wine, but...\"\nThat wasn’t all. He didn’t know this was how it would turn out, but because he killed tens of thousands of monsters, and level 7 elites as well, he’d amassed a fortune of 100 million Perium. He wanted to chat with Pleine and go shopping, but...\n\"God told me something before I left her garden last time. That I should try saving my secret shop permits.\"\n\"Ah, I think she told me that too. So how many do you have?\"\nJin did his job as a hero, same as Lee Shin Woo, but because all of his permits were passed onto him, Lee Shin Woo currently possessed 18 permits. It wasn’t exactly unexpected, but it was still a ridiculous amount.\n\"But Shin Woo, you can share the effects of the permits with people in a contract with you. If that’s the case, then if all the other heroes were to form their own partnerships, then wouldn’t they be able to amass permits really quickly?\"\n\"It seems like it’s not that easy to form a contract as we did.\"\n\"Yeah, I suppose so...\"\nHe hadn’t really known before, but Lee Shin Woo was able to form contracts because of his darkness mana.\nMoreover, if the two parties don’t trust each other completely, then it’ll be difficult to form a contract between them; even Prince, who likes Lloyd so much, hadn’t gone beyond just friendship, so it was understandable.\n\"Now that I think about it, I wonder if Prince leveled up.\"\n\"You’re about to go into the chatting channel again, aren’t you?\"\n\"I’d also like to see how everyone is doing. Plus, I want to make sure that Prince didn’t say some weird stuff about me. Oh, and I’m counting on you to take us to our destination.\"\n\"You asshole...\"\nLee Shin Woo had reached level 7, but Jin was still level 6. Thus, rather than rushing into the level 4 danger zones, they decided to clear the level 3 danger zones that they hadn’t gone to yet.\nAnd if it were at all possible, untrodden land that hadn’t been found by the heroes yet. His main priority was to avoid Ethan Cruz at all cost.\n’I know now. Ethan Cruz is level 8.’\nHe hadn’t been entirely sure when he had watched him from afar, but he’d figured it out after meeting with the level 8 Archmage. He could sense something in common amongst the Archmage, Arema Steelworker, and Ethan Cruz. Their domination over magic.\n’When I leveled up, I just barely learned how to subjugate the ambient mana around me, but... those guys are doing it passively.’\nLee Shin Woo recalled Ethan’s black aura and shook. Level ups raised the level of one’s ’existence’, and thus, one could more naturally control mana.\nEveryone had this in common, regardless of what their karma was.\n’Hoo, I still have a long way to go. I have to work even harder...!’\nLee Shin Woo not only understood this but also possessed the power to dominate mana as a level 7. If a level 8 were to hear about this, then they would pass out while screaming, but unfortunately, only Lee Shin Woo was unaware of what exactly he had achieved.\nAlthough he possessed the ability to dominate mana like Ethan Cruz and had figured out that Ethan was level 8, he gave himself a rough assessment, which was so like Lee Shin Woo.\n’But why is he killing other heroes if he’s level 8? Damn it, he should just go straight to the capital...’\nThey had a level 8 hero on their side, so why did they have to be wary of him? That fact pissed him off, and he entered the chatting channel. However.\n[Mr. Lee Shin Woo has entered.]\n[Ye Jin Jin: Oh, you’re here! Mr. Shin Woo, I have a lot of questions for you! A lot!]\n[Yasunori Akira: I heard, Lee Shin Woo!]\n[Lloyd H.K.: How did you already...]\n[Mentes Orun: It’s all luck. Luck I say.]\n[Silene Viesa: Senior! You’re so cool!]\n[Ethan Cruz: Ooh, I was waiting for you. Our super rookie, Lee Shin Woo!]\nThe moment he entered the chatting channel, he was bombarded by voice messages, which completely rid him of any list of to-dos, Ethan Cruz, or the issue with the Archmage.\n[Lloyd H.K.: You... We all heard. You temporarily teamed up with Prince. Plus...]\nLee Shin Woo realized at that moment. Prince had told them everything in such a short period of time. Of course, she had promised not to tell anyone about his abilities, but there was no provision stating that she couldn’t say anything about his level! Damn it!\n[Ye Jin Jin: I heard that Kratia is really beautiful and her chest is really big! Why didn’t you tell me that you made a new ’friend’? No, wait, where are you right now? Are you with her right now?]\nNo matter how he thought about it, he had no choice but to think of her as a necrophiliac, as she continuously bombarded him with questions. Content orıginally comes from novel_fіre.net\n[Yasunori Akira: Level 7... You’re really level 7? Hoo, I’d thought that you would level up quickly, but this is... it’s quite surprising.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: To think you’re level 7. Even I just got there... There’s no way Prince is lying, but you’re really...]\n[Erian Ruparte: How exactly did you... Even then, you were a lower level than me...]\nThere were some who were shocked by his level and didn’t know how to respond as well.\n[Mentes Orun: Did you receive a growth acceleration skill from God? I heard that there was a hero like that before, but I didn’t think that you’d have one too. I’m happy. And I’m truly thankful, Junior.]\n[Silene Viesa: You’re so cool, Senior! I heard that you killed an elite monster that was a higher level than you! She said it seemed like you were used to it... You really are cool! I really look up to you!]\nThey didn’t even think to ask about how he had reached level 7, and there were some who were just happy about his level up.\n[Ethan Cruz: You really... You really surprised me. My heart’s pounding. Haha, you’re a really cool junior.]\nEthan was like a venomous snake that was licking its lips (at least, that’s what Lee Shin Woo felt). Lee Shin Woo sighed and spoke. He had to somehow smooth out this situation.\n[Lee Shin Woo: A lot happened in a short period of time, so...]\n[Lloyd H.K.: A lot happened? ’A lot happening’ doesn’t explain this, you rascal.]\n[Yasunori Akira: You must’ve risked your life. Probably... a countless number of times. I thought you were a calm and cautious guy, but you’re actually more reckless than anyone. But you won and survived, so I can’t really criticize you...]\n[Erian Ruparte: I’d like to ask you something. Perhaps... At that time, when I told you to run away from one of the 12 general’s troops, did you...]\n[Lee Shin Woo: ...Haha.]\n[Erian Ruparte: As I thought. I feel embarrassed that I assumed you were at my level. Could you please forgive me?]\nLee Shin Woo replied as humbly as he could to move on, but it was impossible. Everyone thought Lee Shin Woo was a monster who went around risking his life! What was most infuriating was that there was nothing wrong with what they were saying. This is why he had tried hiding his level!\nNo, there was no way he would have been able to hide his level forever, so he knew that he would have to reveal it someday. Because his Disguise skill had leveled up a fair bit, he thought it’d be ok to tell them, but someone else revealing his level was different from he himself doing it!\n[Lee Shin Woo: I was just really lucky. As you said, Senior Yasunori, I risked my life several times. Senior Prince also helped quite a bit as well.]\n[Prince Altania: Hmph, of course I did. There’s no way you could’ve done it without me.]\nShe chose to shamelessly appear at that moment. Lee Shin Woo promised that he’d spank her later when they met again.\n[Lee Shin Woo: Senior, were you able to get to level 7?]\n[Prince Altania: Of course I did. Who do you think I am? From now on, call me Archmage Prince. Kratia’s no match for me now.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: Of course, Archmage Prince.]\nIt seemed like she’d completely recovered from the damage she’d sustained from encountering the Archmage. Even though there was a part of her that was cocky, that cockiness allowed her to bounce back quickly. As expected, she was indeed a hero.\n[Ethan Cruz: Anyhow, now... Lloyd, it might be time for us to take on one of the 12 generals.]\nAt that moment, the chatting channel froze. Only Lee Shin Woo could tell what his true intentions were, and soon, the other heroes responded explosively.\n[Lloyd H.K.: Are you sure, Senior!?]\n[Ethan Cruz: Yeah. You reached level 7 just a little while ago, and both Prince and Lee Shin Woo have become level 7, so... We still need to be careful, but we should go looking for one of the weak ones who doesn’t have that many troops.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Senior, I’d like to participate!]\n[Prince Altania: The 12 generals... I-I’d like to participate as well!]\n[Mentes Orun: Ethan, you...]\n[Ethan Cruz: Will you fight with us, Mentes?]\n[Mentes Orun: ...Tch.]\nIt wasn’t a good development. Of course, Lee Shin Woo also wanted to take down the 12 generals, but this was all part of Ethan’s plan, so everything was taking a turn for the worst. Only he could tell exactly what Ethan was planning.\nIndeed, Ethan was definitely planning on ’harvesting’ them now. He’d already experienced this before, so he knew exactly what he was thinking.\n[Lee Shin Woo: I’d like to participate as well, Senior. I’ll tell Kratia as well.]\n[Ethan Cruz: What a reassuring response. It’ll be some time before we stand on the battlefield, as we still need to locate one of the 12 generals, but during that time, make sure you get used to your new level!]\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo didn’t show any signs of him seeing through Ethan’s plan and naturally accepted his request. At the same time, he lightly tapped Jin and said.\n\"The plan’s changed. Mm, let’s change directions. I’ll tell you where.\"\n\"What are we going to do there?\"\n\"Mm, I was going to start doing this after you got to level 7 too, but... the circumstances have changed.\"\nThe reddish black goblin fire within his eye sockets shined dismally.\nHe was originally going to avoid Ethan until he knew he could beat him, but he couldn’t just eat out of the palm of his hand. Therefore, he had no choice but to take him on.\n\"If I want to beat a Hero Hunter, then... I need to take down some heroes too.\"\nLee Shin Woo said and marked several dots on Jin’s minimap. There they would find undead heroes that weren’t under Ethan Cruz’s command.\nLee Shin Woo couldn’t put it off any longer. He would now begin God’s quest in earnest.",

    "content": "<Chapter 30. Hero Hunter - 1>\n[Ye Jin Jin: Are you really just friends?]\n\"Yeah, we just get along really well.\"\n[Ye Jin Jin: Someone you get along really well with...]\n\"We’re just friends. I’m a skeleton, so there’s no way a normal woman would like me. We’re not in a relationship, ok?\"\n[Ye Jin Jin: Uuh...]\nYe Jin Jin interrogated Lee Shin Woo through a private chat, and even after he’d explained to her a few times that he didn’t have any feelings for Kratia, Ye Jin Jin grumbled in distaste.\n[Ye Jin Jin: I’ll be able to form a party with you once I’m level 7 as well, Mr. Shin Woo.]\n\"No, I’m not going to form a party with you. I’m not even in one with Kratia right now.\"\n[Ye Jin Jin: That’s good news... No, in any case, when your levels are similar, then you can relate to them. But I’m still level 5... So I probably won’t be able to participate in taking down one of the 12 generals. I’m ashamed of myself.]\n\"Just keep at it with your own pace. You may die if you rush.\"\n[Ye Jin Jin: Mr. Shin Woo, will you treat me nicely if I die and turn into a zombie or skeleton?]\n\"Nope. I’m sick of being a skeleton myself, so make sure you don’t die.\"\n[Ye Jin Jin: ...Huu, ok.]\nShe seemed better now, as she energetically declared that she wouldn’t die and that she would level up quickly. Then, she ended the chat. Once their conversation was over, Lee Shin Woo muttered with an even more deathly expression, even though he was already dead.\n\"Why are there so many heroes like this?\"\n\"Love makes people act like they’re young again. Even though they know it’s unreasonable, they badger you, and even though they know it’s foolish, they do it anyway... In the end, they make a mistake, cry their heart out, and regret it.\"\nAlthough Lee Shin Woo had just muttered out without thinking, Jin had responded with his own deep comment. But there were a few parts that he couldn’t understand mixed in.\n\"She likes a skeleton. Isn’t there something wrong with her?\"\n\"Love messes with your head. You didn’t know?\"\n\"Hoo, as I thought, you’re the only partner for me, someone who doesn’t care about stuff like love... Hey, what’s wrong!? Hey!\"\n\"I want to train Steel Heart.\"\n\"You don’t have to attack me to train it!\"\nJin realized that he couldn’t harass Lee Shin Woo by just shaking his body anymore, so instead, he controlled the armor atop his body and formed thorns to attack Lee Shin Woo with.\nThe old him wouldn’t have even imagined that he would grow this much, but if his body was pierced by those thorns, then Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t be happy!\nWhile Jin ran at top speed, Lee Shin Woo had to dodge the steel thorns that Jin would attack him with randomly. But in the middle of that, Lee Shin Woo realized something and suddenly became calm.\n\"Huh? I think this could be good training... Jin, try doing it a bit faster.\"\n\"You’re the one whose head is messed up!\"\nRight now, they were travelling to a level 3 danger zone that they had never set foot in before. They could’ve gone straight there if they had taken the golem train, but they were going the long way around in order to avoid Ethan Cruz.\nBut because Jin’s speed almost matched the speed of the train, the time it would take had only increased from one day to two.\n\"A hero in a level 3 danger zone...\"\n\"Ethan Cruz might be looking for the other undead heroes before his ’hunt’. So, we need to make the first move.\"\nLee Shin Woo had already taken care of the heroes in the level 1 and 2 danger zones in the past. Of course, there had only been three of them, including the one who’d given him the Bursting Thunder skill.\nAnyway, all he had left were the level 3 and 4 danger zones. Lee Shin Woo had been postponing the quest because the undead heroes’ powers were unknown to him, but he decided that he needed the strength of the other heroes in order to fight back against Ethan Cruz.\n\"Fortunately, Ethan Cruz doesn’t have an ability that locates the undead heroes for him. At all.\"\nHe had been sure of it. If Ethan Cruz knew where the level 3 danger zone undead heroes were, then he would’ve gotten to them earlier.\nMoreover, Ethan had figured out where Shino Rendu had died and gone over there a few months after his death. Ethan’s information gathering really sucked. In other words, Lee Shin Woo was a cheat, as he knew where all the undead heroes were...\n\"That’s probably why he’s trying to gather us all in one place. Ethan’s trying to gather us in a place he can see and procure us. He’s even using one of the 12 generals as bait...\"\nEthan wasn’t just aiming for Lee Shin Woo alone. He was also gunning for Lloyd, Prince, Kratia... he acted only after they had reached level 7.\nHe was using their complete faith in him to stab them in the back, yet he was facing off against four level 7 heroes. Lee Shin Woo couldn’t even imagine what he was preparing for their fight.\n\"He might expand his forces as well. There’s a high chance that he’s going to move boldly, so I have to make the first move.\"\n\"You’re the boldest. You.\"\nWhile they were on the move, Lee Shin Woo messaged Kratia and roughly explained what Ethan was planning. He didn’t need to add much, as Kratia had already seen Ethan lead the undead heroes.\n[Kratia Melloi: We have to prepare.]\n\"You just need to protect yourself against his darkness element. I’ll take him down myself.\"\n[Kratia Melloi: Ok. I’ll leave that to you. You can also use the darkness element and even have the absorption ability, so it would be hard to fight him for anyone else. ...I’ll need to think about a way to intercept the undead heroes while protecting myself.]\n\"Alright. Let’s work hard.\"\n[Kratia Melloi: Yeah. See you then.]\nOnce he was finished chatting with Kratia, who reassured him with her answer... Lee Shin Woo felt extremely conflicted, but decided to chat with Prince as well. As expected, she spoke passionately, unlike Kratia.\n[Prince Altania: What is it all of a sudden? You’re not mad that I told everyone in the chatting channel your level, are you? That wasn’t in the contract! Me revealing your level is actually helpful to you, as it’ll help you fit in later!]\nLee Shin Woo hadn’t even said anything yet, but she was already defending herself. ’I’ll file a claim regarding that later,’ he replied simply, making her tremble. Lee Shin Woo then continued sternly.\n\"Senior, you know how dangerous darkness mana is, right?\"\n[Prince Altania: I had no idea you could use that formidable magic...!]\n\"Senior Ethan Cruz can also use darkness mana.\"\n[Prince Altania: I know. His buff magic is no joke. They make you feel like your level has increased by one.]\nAs expected, he could concentrate his darkness element into a buff. Of course, if he did so, then he pretty much wouldn’t be able to do anything, but it was still a viable move.\nMoreover, Ethan wasn’t the type of person who buffed people out of the kindness of his heart. There must be something else hidden within that buff.\n\"The true ability of the darkness element isn’t buffing.\"\n[Prince Altania: Obviously. Senior Ethan is better at debuffing. You’ll see for yourself later, but it feels really reassuring to have him by your side. I’m not kidding.]\nHe had somewhat expected this, but... Prince had complete faith in Ethan. Like she was under the effect of a charm! Maybe she was affected by the darkness element. However, Lee Shin Woo had his own trick up his sleeve.\n\"I see. By the way, you remember your debt, right?\"\n[Prince Altania: Eek!?]\nLee Shin Woo gave up on immediately disclosing the truth about Ethan. Prince fully trusted that lunatic, so if he were to tell her the truth, she would immediately private chat with Ethan and make sure he was telling the truth.\n\"It’s nothing special. I was just wondering if you could fight together with us if one of the 12 generals shows up.\"\nBecause of that, he chose to take an indirect approach.\n[Prince Altania: What? But I have to protect Lloyd...]\n\"Lloyd has Erian with him. But when I heard we were going to fight against one of the 12 generals, I started shaking. You can use fire magic, so I’d feel a lot better being with you, Senior...\"\n[Prince Altania: H-Hmm. It’s commendable that you’re aware of my abilities, but even so, I need to protect Lloyd...]\n\"Senior, I need you!\"\n[Prince Altania: Keuk... Well, if you really need me that badly, I guess it can’t be helped.] Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn noveⅼfire.net\nHe laid it on thick in his request, and in the end, Prince caved. Honestly, he thought it was way too easy.\n[Prince Altania: A debt is a debt. Your big sis’ll be by your side then for a day. That’s fine, right?]\n\"Thank you very much.\"\n[Prince Altania: Hoo, it really is great to be the senior.]\nGood. If it comes down to it, as long as he put this dumbass next to Kratia, then she would survive.\nLee Shin Woo was concerned about Lloyd and his other seniors, but to be frank, he didn’t really have the power to save them too. If Lee Shin Woo took down Ethan at the right time, then they would survive. If not, they would die.\n\"Then I’ll contact you later.\"\n[Prince Altania: I told you before, but I have someone I like already. You can’t fall in love with me, alright?]\nLee Shin Woo immediately ended the chat with Prince, as she said something stupid and hadn’t even figured out that he was trying to help her. He was already anticipating spanking her a few times.\n\"Shin Woo, you really like people too.\"\n\"Nope. It would just make me feel bad if people I knew died.\"\n\"No matter what you think, that’s... Shin Woo.\"\nJin was about to offer a rebuttal, but suddenly called Lee Shin Woo calmly. When Jin, who was faster than Lee Shin Woo, called him like this, there was only one thing it could be!\nLee Shin Woo gripped the Breath of the Lightning God in one hand and raised his head. He deepened his connection with Jin and focused his senses, so even he could see it. There was an undead standing atop a hill ahead that was watching them...!\n\"It looks like a magician.\"\n\"Seems that way. Shin Woo, it looks like he’s about to attack us with his magic.\"\n\"Then, shall we start with a light tap?\"\nEven if it’s rotten, it’s still a hero. The undead hero, who had sensed Lee Shin Woo’s party from afar, raised its arm and formed a giant flame in the air. It looked like Prince’s fire magic; while it was weaker, it had formed instantaneously, which made him recollect a monster from somewhere.\n\"It’s an ability from God. But we’re no pushovers!\"\nLee Shin Woo forcefully threw his Breath of the Lightning God into the air. The midair Breath of the Lightning God obeyed his command, erupting in a huge explosion, and temporarily the entire area was tinged with lightning!\nAnd the six Breath of the Lightning Gods that had been floating behind him until now, came forward, as if waiting for that very moment. The six blades sucked in the overflowing lightning energy from the surrounding area and accelerated. Immediately after, he shot the swords straight at the magician!\n’I figured this out from fighting in the training facility. That it’s better to explode one weapon and change the surrounding environment than to explode them all at once, as my weapons will become so much stronger that way!’\nThat’s right. Lee Shin Woo had mastered the idiotic and effective ability he’d learned from his battles in the training facility: to blow up his elemental weapon and change the environment!\n[Kuhahk...!]\nAs expected, the six Breath of the Lightning Gods were much faster than before, and shot out towards the magician with that increased speed.\nThe first sword frontally clashed with the magician’s flame and exploded, dyeing the entire area in lightning. The second sword shot out and was even stronger than before. The magician didn’t even have the time to react as his head was completely destroyed!\n[You have acquired 2 secret shop permits, and 17,554,190 Perium.]\n[You have given peace to a comrade who walked a path he could not return from. You have partially cleared the quest objectives and have acquired 1 secret shop permit. The maximum level of the Invisible Heart skill has increased by 1.]\n\"...Ah.\"\nBecause the magician had died, the remaining four swords lost their target and just remained in the air. They seemed to look around, which was a reflection of how Lee Shin Woo was feeling.\n\"Shin Woo...?\"\nJin looked at Lee Shin Woo strangely, as he had thought that Lee Shin Woo would try bringing the magician to their side before killing it, but Lee Shin Woo did his best to act like nothing was wrong and replied.\n\"I killed him because I thought we’d have to toughen you up a bit first!\"\nHonestly, he hadn’t expected the magician to die from one attack!",

    "content": "<Chapter 30. Hero Hunter - 2>\nAlthough he hadn’t killed him intentionally, he still ended up killing him, so he couldn’t not pick up the loot. Rem flew quickly, picking up the loot for him.\nHe had roughly expected this. The undead hero hadn’t dropped any artifacts and only left behind a tailbone. Lee Shin Woo assumed the undead hero had received a skill from God, rather than an artifact.\n[Lv6 Selleil Von Basti’s tailbone]\n\"But why is it a tailbone?\"\n\"The body deteriorated, but the tailbone remained intact, so it should give me an ability.\"\n\"So each bone differs based on the part...!\"\n\"Yeah, I was lying.\"\n\"You rascal!\"\n[Consuming Lv6 Selleil Von Basti’s tailbone to execute Bone Reinforcement. Magic has increased by 8. Intermediate Fire has become Lv8 and Magic has increased by 15. Intermediate Fire Resistance has become Lv7 and Magic has increased by 20. You have acquired the special passive skill, Mana Acceleration Lv1. Magic has increased by 20.]\n[High Speed Casting and Chantless Casting... With these abilities, I may be able to reach the pinnacle of magic! - Selleil Von Basti]\nBut once he’d actually absorbed the bone, his hypothesis (which he’d said as a joke) had turned out to be correct. Originally, the bone held two abilities: High Speed Casting, which sped up the activation of his spells, and Chantless Casting, which either reduced the incantation or removed it completely!\n’And the two abilities fused into Mana Acceleration to suit me.’\nMana Acceleration was a truly simple skill. It allowed the individual to manipulate mana far faster than what was originally possible for them. What happens when mana moves quickly? Everything created with mana accelerates. If the quick and powerful lightning element were to be accelerated by Mana Acceleration, then it would be like giving wings to a tiger.\nIt was a ridiculous skill that was born from the fusion of the two skills: High Speed Casting and Chantless Casting. It felt like he’d found a treasure in an unexpected place.\n’The higher my Mana Bone skill, the faster the mana I control becomes. That’s why I thought I should focus on developing my Mana Bone skill, rather than gaining a new skill.’\nThe fact that Mana Acceleration didn’t fuse with Mana Bone and became an innate skill meant that this skill was incredibly powerful. With 1 or 2 level ups, the Mana Bone skill would impart an inexplicably large amount of power.\n\"Shin Woo, it feels like your mana circulation has sped up. It used to feel like you had a gentle breeze around you, but now it feels like that breeze is even faster.\"\n\"Mana Acceleration improves my mana circulation, recovery rate, and activation. With this skill, I may be able to make some progress in combining Lightning Shadow and Lightning Sprint. It’d be easy to fuse the Shadow Horn skill with other skills as well...!\"\nLee Shin Woo was conflicted. To think he’d gain such a great skill. Wouldn’t it better if he just killed any undead hero he came across?\nHowever, he soon smiled bitterly and stopped that train of thought. It wasn’t because of Shino Rendu’s heartfelt thanks. It really wasn’t!\n\"Anyway, I’ll hit the next one as weakly as I can, and try to persuade it.\"\n\"As I thought, you killed it by accident.\"\nJin was like ’of course that’s what happened’, sighed, and ran even faster, so that they would avoid Ethan Cruz’s party, or get in a random fight, or to just put the nearest undead heroes to rest and give them salvation.\nAside from the eight undead heroes under Ethan Cruz’s control, there were five undead heroes left in the level 3 danger zone, and four in the level 4 danger zone. There were a total of nine undead heroes left.\n\"It’d be great if we could get half of them.\"\n\"That undead magician might’ve been waiting for you to initiate a conversation.\"\n\"Hey, stop making me feel even guiltier.\"\nLee Shin Woo paid a silent tribute to the undead magician from atop Jin’s back. He hoped that his senior’s liberated soul would be happy in his next life!\nOf course, persuading an undead hero wouldn’t become any easier just because one was determined.\n[Kurwaaaaaaah!]\n\"What kind of human makes that kind of sound...!?\"\n[Kuhaaaah!]\nLee Shin Woo had shown he wasn’t hostile from afar, so that he could convince the next undead hero, but once the undead hero noticed them approach, it charged, and Lee Shin Woo could tell that it clearly had no intellect left.\n\"Keut... Listen to me! You’re forgetting who you are! You’re a hero, aren’t you!?\"\n[Kurwaaaaaa!]\nDespite Lee Shin Woo ardently shouting at the undead hero as soon as he saw it (with Acting and Instigate activated), it opened its mouth wide open and shot a icy breath at them, expressing its clear refusal. Seeing that, Jin grit his teeth.\n\"Keuk, he has a skill like mine...\"\n\"Don’t get competitive over useless stuff like this.\"\nWhile thinking that Kratia would be ecstatic if she could see this guy shooting cold air, he gripped the Bifurcated Snake Spine in one hand. It not only helped with his magical calculations, but it also possessed the Elemental Reversal ability, which was great for blocking his opponent’s elemental attack!\nIts information had been continuously updated in the Bone Armory and compared to when it was first absorbed, its attack power was more than 100 points higher, and the Elemental Reversal ability was even stronger as well.\n[Kurwaaah!?]\nHe raised the staff, sucked in the freezing breath, and spewed out fire! The breath that the staff couldn’t absorb was negated by the fire, while the fire was reinforced by the staff. The undead hero was swept up by the flames and suffered, but finally revealed its true form!\n[Kuhaaaaaaah!]\n\"H-Huh...?\"\nIt shed the rotten human skin and threw it aside. Out came a rotten lizard’s head, covered in pale blue scales, on top of a human body. Of course, it was still undead!\n[Kurwaah!] The source of this content ɪs novel-fire.net\nOnce it discarded its skin, it wrapped its fists in cold air, and attacked. Jin dodged its strike, and at that moment it shot out an even more powerful frost breath. Lee Shin Woo hurriedly turned his staff, absorbed the cold air, and grumbled as he shot out fire.\n\"Damn it. I don’t know if that senior was a Lizardman or a Draconian, but if I want it to remember its species’ pride, then what direction should I go in?\"\n\"Is that really important right now? Say anything!\"\n[Kurwararara!]\nHe’d persuaded several undead and made several monsters go crazy, but he’d never convinced an undead hero, who was in the middle of the two!\nLee Shin Woo accepted that his Acting skill was still not up to par. He should’ve studied other species beforehand, starting with the elves!\n\"Remember your pride. Who’s your enemy!? Why did you become a hero!?\"\nLee Shin Woo consecutively recited lines that would work on several species and spoke strongly as the undead hero attacked him.\nHe estimated that his opponent was level 6, so if he used too much strength, the fight would end instantly. So long as it were possible, he would continue to stimulate it while holding back so he wouldn’t kill it...\n[Kuhaahk! Kurwararararararararara!]\n\"Man, I’m so screwed.\"\nAs expected, he hadn’t properly controlled his strength. The undead hero couldn’t withstand the Bifurcated Snake Spine’s flames and once again shed its skin.\nAround that time, Lee Shin Woo became sure that it was part of the \"Freiza race\". Once it had completed its final transformation, then it would become much smaller and would have much greater destructive force!\n[Kii... Kihiiaaaaaaaah!]\nIt shed its skin once more, and out came a four meter tall lizard. However, the pale blue scales covering its body were only halfway rotten.\nDid its insides not completely rot as it had so much skin on the outside? If that’s the case, then there might still be a chance that it hasn’t transformed into an undead...!\n[Kihiii! Kuooooh!]\n\"It’s just a monster now. Shin Woo... there’s nothing you can do. You have to kill it.\"\n\"Keuk...\"\nAttacking first didn’t work, and counterattacking didn’t work either, so what should he do? Did he just have to scream and take its attacks? That would obviously be dangerous for him, even if he was level 7.\n\"Tch.\"\nLee Shin Woo clicked his tongue and activated Bone Armory’s new option. The staff that had once been in his hand changed into a sword, and then he gazed forward.\n[Kururarara!]\nIt covered its body in ice armor and charged. It was so much stronger than it was at the beginning. It seemed as though its mana had strengthened as well, as the path it tread froze.\n\"Sorry!\"\n[Kahk!]\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo forcefully swung his sword, and a small streak of lightning followed. It passed through its head, down its back, and all the way to its tail. Then, the undead hero split into two pieces and fell to the floor. If Lee Shin Woo had just reached level 6, then it would’ve been a great victory, but not now.\n[You have acquired two secret shop permits and 11,432,860 Perium.]\n[You have given peace to a comrade who walked a path he could not return from.

The maximum level of the Invisible Heart skill has increased by 1.]\n\"This ain’t easy.\"\nLee Shin Woo withdrew his sword and smiled bitterly. He may have become too confident after he’d made Shino Rendu his subordinate. There were so many variables that came into play when dealing with the undead, and he had been careless...\n[You have acquired Lv6 Suita In Pisek’s skull.]\n[You have acquired Lv6 Suita In Pisek’s ice skin.]\n[You have acquired the Lv4 Ancient Lizard Leather Clothes. Bone Reinforcement has transformed it into the Lv4 Glacier Lizard Skin Armor (+5).]\n\"Oh, it dropped two bones!\"\n\"Be remorseful or happy. Choose one.\"\nLee Shin Woo was briefly remorseful, but after that, he absorbed the skull to acquire the information held within. As he’d roughly expected, his Ice Element and Ice Resistance leveled up sharply, and because of that, his magic and health increased as well.\n\"You absorb the Ice Skin.\"\n\"I know what you’re thinking, but I won’t grow any skin.\"\n\"To think you can’t understand my pure wishes of wanting my partner to grow...\"\n\"You can’t fool me anymore.\"\nLee Shin Woo reinforced Jin, allowing him to absorb the Ice Skin. Just like he’d wanted, Jin gained Intermediate Ice Resistance. That wasn’t all; it seemed like he gained some proficiency in Steel Heart as well. Finally, Lee Shin Woo absorbed the Skin Armor, which was the jackpot.\n[The Lv4 Glacier Lizard Skin Armor (+5) is being absorbed through Bone Reinforcement. Health has increased by 7 and Magic by 8. Intermediate Ice Resistance has become Lv7 and Magic has increased by an additional 5.]\n[The information for the Lv4 Glacier Lizard Skin Armor (+5) is being recorded in the Bone Armory. Your armor can now be changed into scale armor, and additionally, the Lv4 Ice Element can be applied to all equipment in the Bone Armory! The Bone Armory’s information is being extensively updated.]\nHe’d gotten one step closer to collecting all of the various elements for his equipment (which he’d forgotten about)! Lee Shin Woo imagined himself changing the elements of his equipment as he swapped out his equipment, and grinned. Seeing that, Jin’s goblin fire blazed coldly, and he muttered.\n\"This guy... He’s going to kill all of them, isn’t he...?\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 30. Hero Hunter - 3>\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t able to convince the next two heroes and was forced to kill them. One of them was a level 6 undead hero, who possessed balanced stats (which he hadn’t seen in a long time), but it hadn’t possessed an exceptional skill of any kind, so it merely raised his stats a little bit. What a bummer.\nThe other was just a level 5. It didn’t have a special skill, but it did have an artifact!\nThen, a level 6 Treasure Eater appeared, so he ended up killing it too. All this time, the Treasure Eater hadn’t eaten the artifact, so he considered himself quite fortunate. Lee Shin Woo thought he might have pheromones that attracted Treasure Eaters, but there was no way of knowing.\n[You have acquired the Lv6 Titan’s Pride.]\n[You have acquired the Lv5 Gambling King’s Jewel. Through Bone Reinforcement, it is transformed into the Lv6 Critical Star Fossil!]\n\"Steve, you always come at the best of times.\"\n\"You know, you used to swear whenever it appeared out of nowhere.\"\nLee Shin Woo ignored Jin’s valid retort and checked the two level 6 items. Through Bone Reinforcement, the level 5 artifact leveled up, and with even one of these items, one could be a stupendous hero (once she saw Kratia’s orb, Prince had grumbled jealousy and explained), but he now had two such artifacts in his possession!\n[Titan’s Pride]\n[Lv6]\n[Durability: 17,500/17,500]\n[Defense: 2,100 - 2,400]\n[Options: Health + 100, Defensive Effect + 70%]\n[Passive skill: Titan’s Fury - If you successfully defend against your opponent’s attack, then you can return a portion of that damage onto your opponent.]\nThe Titan’s Pride was a thick and huge shield that was 10 meters tall and 4 meters wide. Because it was entirely made of bone right off the bat, it didn’t change.\nIts defense was amazing, but it was way too big, so Lee Shin Woo couldn’t effectively hold the shield. He had been shocked when the shield had popped out after killing Steve!\n\"Where did Steve even get this thing?\"\n\"Seems like Titans also exist in the Empire...\"\nLee Shin Woo was anxious, as he wondered whether he could absorb the shield or not. Even so, he stretched out his hand, gripped the tip of the shield, and slowly activated Bone Reinforcement. Then, the shield immediately was enveloped in black energy, and was entirely sucked into Lee Shin Woo!\n[Absorbing the Lv6 Titan’s Pride through the Bone Reinforcement skill. Health has increased by 100.]\n[Bone Armory has stored the information of the Lv6 Titan’s Pride. The Titan’s Pride will be scaled down to fit the user and can now be summoned. You can now gigantify and summon the equipment stored in the Bone Armory.]\n[If Bone Armory levels up just a bit more, then it will become possible to fuse the information of the Titan’s Pride and the Bone Fortress, which will likely result in a new piece of equipment.]\n\"Ooooh...!\"\nAt first, Lee Shin Woo had been concerned that he’d never get the opportunity to use this piece of level 6 equipment, but that wasn’t the case because of Bone Armory’s modification ability. Moreover, he was now able to gigantify his equipment, though he had absolutely no idea how he would apply the new ability!\n\"If I end up having to disguise myself as a Titan, then I won’t be in a pickle because I have a weapon I can use.\"\n\"You... Don’t say stuff that’s so clearly distressing.\"\nLee Shin Woo summoned the scaled down Titan’s Pride. Although its maximum defense reduced by 600, its options remained the same!\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo preferred dodging attacks and counter attacking over just defending because of his connection with Jin, which increased his dynamic visual acuity and his reflexes. But there was nothing wrong with obtaining such a durable shield.\n\"No matter how much I thank them (Steves), it’s not enough.\"\n\"You really are terrible.\"\nLee Shin Woo pretended like he was listening to Jin and looked over the Lv6 Critical Star Fossil next. This was the result of Bone Reinforcement leveling up the hero’s original level 5 artifact, the Gambling King’s Jewel. When he took a closer look...\n[Critical Star Fossil]\n[Lv6]\n[Durability: 320/320]\n[Options: All stats + 10]\n[Passive skill: Lucky Strike - There is an extremely high chance that the amount of Perium you pick up will increase.]\n\"Huh!?\"\nBut Lee Shin Woo immediately flinched when he looked over the item’s info. It was a fossil necklace in the shape of a star; it emitted a gentle light, and its info was truly extraordinary!\nOf course, it was a skill that relied on chance, but when it worked, it would increase the amount of Perium he picked up. To the heroes, who relied on God’s secret shop, it was an item worth staking their lives on!\n\"He must’ve been so bitter that he died while possessing this item...\"\nOf course, he didn’t know what ability the Star Fossil possessed prior to its transformation, but he was certain that it would bring good fortune to the equipper. Lee Shin Woo expressed his condolences to the dead hero again, but his condolences and him hitting jackpot were two different things, so he mercilessly absorbed the Star Fossil.\n[Absorbing the Lv6 Critical Star Fossil through the Bone Reinforcement skill. All stats have increased by 10. You have acquired the special passive skill, Lucky Strike Lv1.]\nLee Shin Woo flinched once more. He thought the Star Fossil would be stored in the Bone Armory, but he had learned the necklace’s ability as a skill instead.\nAnd now that he thought about it, Lee Shin Woo didn’t have any accessories stored in the Bone Armory, despite him absorbing accessory type artifacts (or bones that ’used to look like’ accessories). Perhaps Bone Armory was supposed to be used that way. He’d gained a skill that had the potential for growth, so it was an even better result.\n\"This is tough. I have to keep the rest of my undead seniors alive...\"\n\"You say that, but you’re smiling so evilly...\"\nLee Shin Woo felt so much wealthier and ran through the Empire with Jin. There were only two undead heroes left in the danger level 3 zone. Ethan Cruz’s undead group was also in the level 3 danger zone, so he wanted to deal with the rest of them as quickly as possible and move onto the level 4 danger zone.\nHowever, a quarter of a day had passed.\n\"Shin Woo, I see him.\"\n\"Nice, then... You have forgotten who you are, hero. What are you doing hereeeeeeeeeeee!\"\nLee Shin Woo found the next senior halfway through a level 5 dungeon, and spoke the third line of his ’senior wake up alarm compilation’.\nBut to be honest, Lee Shin Woo had become tired of repeatedly attempting to convince them and repeatedly failing as a result, as he was still only human. Once he’d thrown out a few lines of his compilation, he got ready to go into hunting mode...\n\"I-I am... I am...!]\n\"Huh!?\"\n[What... have I...!]\nBut when the undead hero replied with a bit of his intellect, he was so flustered (as it had been such a long time since this had last worked), even though he had elicited the desired response!\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo quickly got a hold of himself, hurriedly withdrew his weapon and yelled once again. He shouted out line one of the ’senior wake up alarm compilation’, which was also his most effective!\n\"Aren’t you a hero who sought to purify the Empire!? Your body may be soiled, but do you plan to dirty your soul as well!?\"\n[Soul, my soul...! Is my soul still here...?]\n\"Who killed you? Who do you need to kill!?\"\n\"Shin Woo, you look really excited...\"\nLee Shin Woo kept stimulating his mind by throwing out these lines, and then, the undead hero began to squirm, which was quite the laughable sight.\nBut it seemed like his body and mind still weren’t completely in sync, as he aimed both his arms’ bronze fingernails at Lee Shin Woo and shot them at him. They were so fast that Lee Shin Woo couldn’t hope to dodge them!\n’No way, this is...!’\nDespite Lee Shin Woo being in a level 3 danger zone, he thought that perhaps this opponent was a level 7, and was able to dodge the attack through his connection with Jin.\nThey would probably be able to fight against him for a short period of time, but the longer they were unable to mount a proper offensive, the worse the situation would get for them. He would persuade him before then!\n\"Open your eyes. Remember your name!\"\n[I’m a hero... A hero who once followed God’s command...]\n\"Who should you be pointing those fingernails at!?\"\n[They made me into an undead...!]\n\"And who is it that made you into an undead?\"\n[The Empire... and the heroes!]\n\"What?\"\nHuh? What did the heroes have to do with this? Lee Shin Woo was momentarily unable to speak but was somehow able to push on. The undead hero’s fingernails had cut through the air and grazed the edge of Lee Shin Woo’s armor.\n\"The pure heroes might get caught up in those heroes’ plot!\"\n[What... did you say...?]\nHis movement momentarily froze. Yeah, this was it! He did it!\n[The other heroes... will be caught up in that man’s plot...?]\n\"The other heroes don’t know about his sinister plot as of yet. Are you just going to sit there and let them be sacrificed like you were!?\"\n[Other pure heroes...]\nHe agreed with him. Lee Shin Woo was sure that his words were super effective on him. What remarkable wit.\nIf that’s the case, then he needed to strike a decisive blow, but was the man that ambushed him and the one who was trying to kill Lee Shin Woo one and the same? Lee Shin Woo slightly pondered the subject, but... he decided to go with his winning move.\n\"Ethan Cruz.\"\n[Gureureureuk.]\nThe moment Lee Shin Woo uttered his name, the undead hero bared his teeth and screamed like a wild beast. From the outside, he almost looked entirely human, but his nails were unusually sharp and he could attack with them as well, signaling that he probably wasn’t human, like the hero Lee Shin Woo had fought before.\n[Ethan... Cruz...!]\n\"Yeah. Right now he’s trying to kill the pure-hearted heroes who follow God’s command.\"\n[Ethan... and Mentes...! Those bastards! They killed me and tried to control me! I was able to escape their control because of my darkness energy, but in the end, I became like this!] This update ıs available on novᴇlfire.net\nMm, something he’d only suspected had been disclosed! To be honest, when Ethan had first suggested that they hunt one of the 12 generals and Mentes had reacted negatively to it, he thought that perhaps Mentes was in on his plan. And it turns out that they were indeed connected.\n’They probably convinced themselves that this was the only way to purify the Empire.’\n\"Follow me if you want revenge. I’ll give you new power and a new chance.\"\n[You will...?]\nThe undead hero instinctively withdrew his fingernails (that were pointed at Lee Shin Woo), and asked. It seemed like much of his reasoning had been restored. He did it! He’s almost there! Lee Shin Woo felt like cheering.\n\"Yeah. You’re incomplete, and I can make you whole.\"\n[Are you like Ethan Cruz? If that’s the case, then...]\n\"What you should be asking me isn’t so trivial.\"\nLee Shin Woo purposefully cut him off with a strong tone.\n\"Can we kill Ethan Cruz and Mentes Orun. Isn’t that what you should be asking me?\"\n[...]\nThe eyes of a ferocious beast stared at Lee Shin Woo from behind his rotten human flesh.\nHe had realized that he wouldn’t be able to win against Lee Shin Woo at full strength. But he decided that if Lee Shin Woo were to try convincing him by force, then he would take an arm with him and leave behind this curse ridden life. However...\n[Who are you?]\n\"I’m Paul Zero. I’m an undead like you. Ah, that’s right. I’m a bit unique, as I work together with the heroes.\"\n[Paul Zero, what do you want?]\n\"Life. At the same time, I want freedom... I also want to destroy everything connected to this disgusting curse.\"\n[Can you promise me that you’ll release me when everything is over?]\n\"I’ll release you if that time comes.\"\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t interested in world domination. He killed the undead heroes not to increase his fighting strength, but to give them another chance to fight... No, never mind.\n[...Fine. I agree. I, Bisher Moon of the Moon Clan will follow you, Paul Zero.]\nDid he figure out that Lee Shin Woo was telling the truth? A beast in the form of a human... Bisher Moon took a step back and respectfully bowed his head. At that moment, he completely discarded his human skin!\n’As I thought, he wasn’t human... He was a Lycanthrope!’\nAt the same time, Lee Shin Woo’s darkness mana enclosed the Lycanthrope’s body, and as if responding to it, dark energy poured out of the Lycanthrope as well. It wasn’t the curse’s energy that had covered his body, but his darkness mana!\n’He said he was able to escape their control because of his darkness energy. So this is what he meant.’\nPerhaps Ethan had been gunning for him because of his darkness energy. While he nodded his head, Lee Shin Woo’s mana completely covered the Lycanthrope, strengthening him. He was familiar with this now.\n[The Lv7 Elite Ghoul has become the Lv7 Wolf Avenger - Bisher Moon. You have restored a high rank undead’s intellect, and have made him your subordinate. All stats have increased by 1.]\n[The Intermediate Command skill has become Lv10 and has evolved into the high rank level! All stats have increased by 10! The number of subordinates you can command at once has increased significantly, and you can effectively command specified subordinates with complicated tactics, even from afar!]\n[High Rank Darkness has become Lv2 and Magic has increased by 20!]\n[Proficiency in the Acting, Instigate, and Disguise skills have increased by 16%. The Acting skill has become Lv17.]\nOnce all the black mana had been completely absorbed, Bisher Moon’s true appearance was revealed. Befitting a Lycanthrope, he looked like a cross between a wolf and man. He possessed a bronze, robust and muscular body, which made it nigh unbelievable that he was undead, and a face and mane that resembled a wolf. Also, his body was fully covered by a black metallic armor!\nThere was only one thing that proved he was undead: a blue goblin fire blazed within the whites of his eyes. He looked similar to Shino Rendu and the Chi Pauls.\n[I understand now. Your use of darkness energy is incomparable to mine. I’ve met an undead who isn’t truly an undead.]\n\"Yeah. I’ll be counting on you, Bisher Moon. With that in mind, let’s...\"\nLee Shin Woo wondered why all the high level undead he formed a master-servant contract with gained such cool bodies and armor. Even though he was jealous of them, he still remained outwardly calm and said.\n\"Shall we talk about Ethan Cruz and Mentes Orun?\"\n[Of course.]\nBisher Moon nodded his head as if he were waiting for this. There was no way Ethan Cruz and Mentes Orun could know that their victim had become his subordinate and was telling him everything about them.\nBut Lee Shin Woo’s preparations for his hunt had just begun. He was prepared to fight Ethan ’fair and square’!",

    "content": "<Chapter 30. Hero Hunter - 4>\n[It all began when they started calling me privately. They told me that they really valued me and that I had the ability to quickly make it to the top...]\n\"Hmm.\"\nBisher Moon began, and it sounded so similar to something Lee Shin Woo had heard before. That’s right. It was almost identical to what Ethan Cruz had said to him!\nBut there was one thing different: Ethan had gotten Mentes Orun involved early on with Bisher Moon. Bisher had been suspicious of Ethan Cruz but hadn’t suspected Mentes Orun. Thus, Bisher Moon fell for a trap and was cursed by Ethan. That curse was...\n\"...Say again?\"\n[It is called Deadly Force, a curse that’s almost the same as death. It’s one of the world’s worst curses, and so long as you’re not well-versed in using darkness magic, you won’t even notice that you’re affected by it.]\nHe’d heard that Ethan used curses, but he was this powerful? While Lee Shin Woo was astonished, Bisher Moon added to his explanation.\n[I believe Deadly Force was created by mixing together the Empire’s curse, as well as a few other ones.]\n\"Indeed. You’re right, it makes sense.\"\n[Deadly Force is so subtle that you wouldn’t even know you were affected by it, even if they cast it right in front of you, but... Though unskilled, I’m able to use darkness magic. The moment I realized that I’d been cursed, I desperately tried to fight it off. He tried to cast a subordination curse onto me, but I was able to dispel it with my darkness magic.]\n\"But he couldn’t chase you down?\"\nAccording to Bisher, he had been dead for years. If that’s the case, then Ethan was already incredibly powerful in the past. Lee Shin Woo asked a reasonable question and Bisher replied firmly. Honestly, this was the core issue here.\n[Because Deadly Force is such a fatal curse, it has a few downsides. First, it’s difficult to use against those with more magic than the caster. Second, the target can move freely until their death. It’s all or nothing.]\n\"Aha.\"\nLee Shin Woo recollected what God had told him before. He needn’t be worried about Ethan Cruz... Since he possessed Curse Resistance: MAX, there was no way Ethan Cruz’s curses could affect him. Well, so long as his undead weren’t nearby!\n[That’s probably why he called for Mentes Orun. But because I knew about the curse beforehand, I was able to fight off Mentes Orun and run away.]\n\"What about the other undead?\"\n[I was able to momentarily confuse them with my darkness magic. As darkness magic forms master-servant contracts, it can likewise be used to weaken that link.]\nLee Shin Woo could understand why God awakened his darkness magic! And for someone who was so ’unskilled’, Bisher Moon sure seemed like an expert!\n[But it was a really close call. If I had made a decision a split second too late, hadn’t injured Mentes Orun, or hadn’t been able to confuse Ethan’s undead subordinates with my darkness magic, then I would probably be by his side right now.]\nAnd Lee Shin Woo would’ve had to prepare himself for nine undead rather than eight. There was one thing he knew for certain: if he wanted to beat Ethan, then he would need to rip the undead from his control!\n’And if I can, get him to use a curse on me...’\nEthan wouldn’t expect him to take that magic head on, so he would have to do his very best to make him use Deadly Force on him. Lee Shin Woo was starting to form a plan in his head. Ah, plus...\n\"I originally wanted you to join up and lead my other subordinates until the time for your revenge came, but...\"\n[I will, so long as it helps me get my revenge.]\n\"Even though we’ll move slower, we should go together. You see, I’d like you to tell me everything you know about darkness magic. A few days should be fine.\"\n’What!? I’m not going to put another guy on my back!’\n[But you can use darkness magic that’s much greater than mine...!]\nLee Shin Woo’s bombshell caused both Jin and Bisher to yell in astonishment simultaneously. He comforted Jin, saying that he had no intention of letting Bisher ride on his back, and then replied.\n\"I may know how to use the darkness element, but I don’t really know how to use it, so teach me the basics.\"\n[How can that be? For someone who can command that much darkness...]\nIt was as though he, who couldn’t even crawl before Lee Shin Woo at his level, was given the ability to fly in the sky. But it was the truth, so it couldn’t be helped. Of course, Bisher couldn’t refuse Lee Shin Woo’s request, so they would temporarily travel together...\n[Hut, that’s correct. That’s confusion.]\n\"Ah, it really is easy. Then, is that it?\"\n[Yes, that’s correct...]\nHe was finished in just half a day.\n\"Nice. Thanks for taking all this time to teach me everything.\"\n[All this time? It’s only been a little over 10 hours...]\nThe Empire’s artificial sun slowly dimmed and it had become night. He had given peace to the final undead hero in the level 3 danger zone (unfortunately, this senior was a big fat zero again), so he was in the middle of moving onto the level 4 danger zone.\nLee Shin Woo was able to understand Bisher’s darkness magic, which he’d trained for his entire life (before his death), in one go. He looked at Lee Shin Woo and asked him in small disbelief.\n[I’d like to think that you weren’t making fun of me, but... Were you truly unaware of it?] Dıscover more novels at novęlfire.net\n\"I’d just awakened this power, so all I know is contracts, curses, and resistance. But because of you, I feel like I’ve grasped the basics, so thanks.\"\nBisher realized that Lee Shin Woo was telling the truth, and felt empty as he didn’t know what to say. Jin thought it’d been a long time since he’d had another comrade, and knocked on his knees.\n[As a descendant of the Moon Clan, several people have told me that I was exceptional, but Paul Zero, your talent trumps mine.]\n\"I’ve been hearing that a lot lately. Now, let’s talk about your mission from here on out. All you need to do is go over here...\"\nAmongst the Pauls that were following his command and treading across the Empire, Lee Shin Woo picked those that were high leveled and weren’t a part of Shino Rendu’s group and told Bisher of his intent. Henceforth, they would move together with Bisher Moon.\n\"I’ve already told a few other teams to enter the level 4 danger zone. You may not be traveling with them, but in case of an emergency, make sure you’re close enough to each other so you can help each other if in need. You got it?\"\n[Of course. Since I went through there in the past. There’s no way of knowing how dangerous a large city will be.]\nAfter just one awakening, Bisher Moon had regained all of his memories as a hero, which almost made him forget that he was an undead now. Was the rate at which he recovered his memories faster than Shino Rendu because he died at a higher level?\n\"Yeah. Remember to adopt hit-and-run tactics. If you’re caught by one of the 12 generals, or if you run across an informant, then report it to me immediately.\"\n[You really are cooperating with the heroes in order to purify the Empire.]\n\"Of course I am. ...And we’ll kill Ethan Cruz faster than you expected. I’ll call you before then, so make sure you’re prepared.\"\n[...That’s exactly what I wanted to hear.]\nLee Shin Woo had gotten a solid grasp on Bisher Moon’s abilities, as he spent a half a day with him. His pledge of loyalty hadn’t been an empty promise, and he was sure that Bisher wasn’t the lying type. He was plenty satisfied with that.\n[Above all, I’m really happy that I can get stronger again...!]\n\"Then get going, if for no other reason than to get stronger.\"\n[I understand!]\nBisher departed in satisfaction. Once he’d sent him off, Lee Shin Woo spread out his map and approximated where his subordinates were.\n\"Good. They’re still doing well. Not many have died either.\"\n\"Of course they are. They’re all elites...!\"\n\"Even so, it would be over for them in an instant if they made a mistake. It’s a relief that they’re growing within that danger.\"\nThe level 4 Bronze Golems (which were the only ones amongst his subordinates that weren’t elites) treaded through the level 2 danger zone, while the level 5 and 6 golems and Pauls traversed through the level 3 danger zone. And now, the Chi Pauls (the Chimera Avengers) and the group of elite Pauls led by Shino Rendu and Bisher Moon respectively were allowed to go through the level 4 danger zone...\nLee Shin Woo organized a path for them so that they could avoid danger and grow as much as possible. If they can grow safely by avoiding the heroes, especially Ethan Cruz, then it wouldn’t be long before he led them into the fight against one of the 12 generals.\n\"It’s unfortunate since it seems like Anti-Skull will show up soon. If Ethan Cruz wasn’t such a bastard, then I would’ve taken my time and infiltrated Anti-Skull.\"\n\"Yeah, so unfortunate. Let’s kill Ethan Cruz and go play with Anti-Skull instead.\"\nJin, who’d seemingly reached a state of nirvana, replied to Lee Shin Woo’s incomprehensible words and ran. They were in a quiet grassland, but it seemed like tension was filling the area.\n\"I have no idea what’s going to show up...\"\n\"Well, that’s the kind of place we’re going to after all.\"\nNow they were in the level 4 danger zone, which included the large city that was connected to a satellite city, as well as the rugged free land in between. It was the cream of the crop, the land that encompassed 30% of the Empire (with the capital at its center). In other words, it held the highest difficulty.\nThe troops under one of the 12 general’s direct command would be stationed here, and it wouldn’t be strange if they were to encounter one of the 12 generals in person. They had reached the frontline of the heroes.\n\"I’ve learned which places are safe from our seniors.\"\n\"So which place is safe?\"\n\"Mm... at the very least, it’s not here. You won’t be able to hear over there, either.\"\n\"Then their info’s pointless!\"\n\"No, it’s telling us that it’d be a waste of time to go over there, so it’s valuable information!\"\nSince it was a safe spot that had been procured by heroes dozens of years prior, then that meant that it wouldn’t be the least bit helpful to Lee Shin Woo!\n\"And we know where Ethan Cruz frequents, as well as where one of the 12 generals supposedly patrols, so it’s fine. Plus... I was able to figure out how I could acquire my seniors (the undead ones) while avoiding the notice of my other seniors.\"\n\"You’re talking about your senior heroes, right...\"\nAll his seniors who were going through the level 4 danger zone were level 7 monsters. If they were to see him right now with his Disguise up, or even if his true appearance was exposed, he was confident that he could get through it unscathed, but he really didn’t want his seniors to know where he was.\n\"Yeah, good job you... Shin Woo!\"\n\"Huh!?\"\nJin sharply called for Lee Shin Woo. They hadn’t reached an area with an undead hero yet. If that’s the case, then...! Lee Shin Woo raised his head. He was soon able to sense the death energy ahead of them that filled the grassland to the brim.\n\"Mm, as I thought, level 4 danger zones are really on a different level.\"\n\"Why are you so calm? There are so many high rank level 6 elites everywhere...!\"\nThey weren’t heroes either. Nor were they one of the 12 generals. There were just thousands of undead roaming around where they needed to pass through. Most of them were level 6, and a small minority were level 5! Lee Shin Woo saw them and muttered in satisfaction.\n\"This many should get you to level 7 in a flash.\"\n\"You’re not going for a frontal breakthrough, are you...?\"\n\"This is nothing compared to the large-scale battle we faced in the training facility. Let’s go, Jin!\"\n\"...Ah, screw it!\"\nAfter that, Lee shin Woo and Jin besieged thousands of undead with just the two of them, and in just two hours and thirty minutes, all of the undead completely disappeared. And that’s how the two skeleton heroes made their level 4 danger zone debut.",

    "content": "<Chapter 30. Hero Hunter - 5>\n[Lloyd H.K.: The monsters’ movements in the level 4 danger zone are a bit strange.]\nLloyd said, and Lee Shin Woo realized that it was about time.\n[Lloyd H.K.: It’s like they’re being chased by something, and it’s becoming more difficult to hunt, as more and more monsters are grouping together.]\n[Prince Altania: They’re just scared of you.]\n[Yasunori Akira: It’s not like that over here. Maybe it’s just localized.]\nOf course it was localized. Since it’d only been two days since Lee Shin Woo had entered the level 4 danger zone.\n[Lloyd H.K.: It’s still too much, even if we write it off as localized movement. There’s definitely something incredibly powerful moving around over here. It might even be one of the 12 generals...]\n[Ethan Cruz: Want me to go over there?]\n[Lloyd H.K.: No, it’s not a big enough issue for you to... Mm, could you please come over here?]\n[Ethan Cruz: Of course.]\nAs he left the chatting channel, Lee Shin Woo felt like he was breaking into a cold sweat. He and Jin had hunted such a large quantity of monsters that it seemed like they’d been discovered.\nHe’d killed thousands of monsters a few times already, so the other monsters found out. Then, unfortunately, those monsters left in droves to avoid them. The undead monsters! In order to escape them!\n\"I thought I’d be able to go wild in the level 4 danger zone, as there are so many high level monsters here, but...\"\n\"The other heroes aren’t hunting the high level monsters like we are...\" This update ıs available on novelfire(.)net\nUnfortunately, after his fight in the training facility, he had learned how to fight against a large quantity of enemies, so Lee Shin Woo had become fond of fearlessly charging into enemies, regardless of how many there were.\nThough it was a level 4 danger zone, Lee Shin Woo and Jin trusted in their immortal bodies and slaughtered the monsters, as they only needed to be wary of the level 7 monsters, as even the level 6 monsters were no match for them. That’s why Jin’s stats had increased by more than 100 in just two days.\n\"If we just keep at this for another 2 weeks, you should be able reach level 7...\"\n\"Isn’t that damn Necromancer coming? Let’s avoid him and just do what we need to.\"\nJin obediently accepted Bone Reinforcement, and Lee Shin Woo hunted diligently, like a mother bird bringing worms for its newborn, yet they’d lost such a good opportunity because of Ethan Cruz!\n\"Damn it, I guess it can’t be helped...\"\nOf course, they hadn’t just been killing monsters. They’d found a hidden undead hero and had given him eternal peace.\nThe undead hero had been only level 6, but he had possessed an incredible proficiency in combat, so once he absorbed the bone following his defeat, Lee Shin Woo’s High Rank Bursting Thunder skill leveled up by 1, and his Intermediate Shadow Horn skill by 3. It was quite a significant development.\n\"He seemed like a good senior, so I really wanted to keep him alive...\"\n\"Why do they awaken when they hear your voice...?\"\n\"I want to know that too. Rem, do you know?\"\n[I can only affect golems for now...]\nYeah, of course that’s how it was. Lee Shin Woo sighed and patted Jin. When he’d heard about Ethan in the chatting channel, they avoided the monsters and ran away. They were preparing for the inevitable fight against him, but they weren’t ready. Not yet at least.\n\"We’ll find another one soon.\"\n\"We’re in the flatlands right now, though... Which means it’s in a dungeon.\"\n\"Let’s go in carefully, so that we’re not discovered by the flying monsters.\"\n\"Ok.\"\nIt had been two days since they’d entered the level 4 danger zone, and they already looked quite dignified. Then again, they risked their lives more so than any other hero in order to explore the area, so it seemed obvious that they would accumulate that much experience.\n\"I hope we find someone that we can actually talk to this time... Mm.\"\nLee Shin Woo found the entrance to the dungeon and opened it. He opened it so naturally, like flowing water. There was a considerable amount of magic and monsters within the dungeons in the high level areas. And that’s exactly what all the undead want!\nThus, if they were noticed the moment they opened the dungeon, then they might experience a barrage of undead monster attacks.\nTo be honest, his seniors had suggested that he ’be careful when entering dungeons’ when he had entered the level 3 danger zone, but whenever the undead swarmed him, he’d say ’Hut, nice’ and just kill them, so he hadn’t worried about it.\n\"Nice, it’s clear.\"\nLee Shin Woo skillfully opened the dungeon before the monsters could swarm them, and entered with Jin. The opening of the dungeon closed instantly. They had finished things perfectly.\n[Level 6 Elite Dungeon - You have acquired the permit for Mole Heaven. All stats are increased by 30 within the dungeon. The dungeon’s information is added to your minimap. All actions are buffed within the dungeon.]\n\"This is our first time in a level 6 elite dungeon. Will we be ok?\"\n\"If it were a level 7 elite dungeon, I might be concerned, but a level 6 elite dungeon should be fine. Our problem’s the senior who’s inside...\"\nThe dungeon was so silent that they felt uneasy. Which meant that all of the monsters had been killed already. So it was highly likely that the hero was safe when he had first entered the dungeon. Yet, he still died. Most likely to an elite monster, or the boss...\n\"He was so meticulous in clearing, so much so that I don’t feel any presences in the entire area. Yet he still died, which means that the dungeon boss must be no joke.\"\nHe might even have to fight against the undead hero and the boss simultaneously, and tightly gripped the Breath of the Lightning God. The six fully charged Breath of the Lightning Gods were summoned behind him and shook.\nJin wondered whether anyone could survive the barrage of the Lightning God... or Lee Shin Woo’s secret name for it, Lightning God’s Breath, but Jin didn’t say it out loud.\n\"Let’s go slowly, shall we?\"\n\"Ok.\"\nLee Shin Woo silently blew up the Breath of the Lightning God that had been in his hand. The thundercloud spread out in every direction instantaneously, and he continuously inhaled and exhaled through his Mana Breath, causing the environment to remain filled with lightning energy. He was forcing his surroundings to become tinged in lightning energy through his authority!\n\"Good. It’s become more stable.\"\n\"It always feels like my Lightning Resistance will level up...\"\n[I as well.]\nThis was one of techniques he’d learned once he’d reached level 7. Immediately changing the environment into one advantageous to him was a high level technique that wouldn’t lose out to a level 8. It was only possible because of the balance among the Bone Armory, Rule of Bone, and Mana Bone skills.\n’Though I can do the same thing with Mana Breath, without any explosions...’\nHowever, not only did that approach take much longer, but the energy emitted from the Breath of the Lightning God doing it this way was more powerful as well.\nBecause his mana recovery rate was much greater than before, he could now re-summon the Breath of the Lightning God without much difficulty and fully charge it as well, so this method was much better for him.\n\"But even so... Jin?\"\n\"We’re using Assimilation to its max right now. I feel like what I feel, you feel too.\"\n\"Mm.\"\nAfter Lee Shin Woo had re-summoned another Breath of the Lightning God, infused mana into it, and was fully prepared for battle, he noticed that their situation hadn’t changed and felt embarrassed.\nOf course, this level 6 elite dungeon had several side roads here and there, and as it was Mole Heaven, there were several big holes as well. It was also a considerably large dungeon, but even taking all of that into account, there were too few presences.\nAt Jin’s level, his crawl was as fast as a train, but even at that speed, there was nothing that they found!\n\"Where’s that senior? Is he really here? Maybe this is an empty dungeon that someone already cleared.\"\n\"He’s definitely in here, but... there’s only one undead senior inside of an empty dungeon...? If I were to make sense of this, then...\nLee Shin Woo’s goblin fire burnt gently and gripped his Breath of the Lightning God more tightly. Jin, inspired by Lee Shin Woo’s fighting spirit, followed suit and became cautious. They went deeper into the dungeon, exploring every nook and cranny, and in the end, they arrived near the boss room.\n\"He’s not here...\"\n\"Shin Woo, are you ok?\"\nLee Shin Woo finally came to the conclusion that there weren’t any monsters within the dungeon. He had been suspicious when he hadn’t felt any living energy within the dungeon, but he hadn’t expected the boss to be dead as well, and felt dejected.\n\"They really did go to heaven.\"\n\"You’re terrible. So what are you going to do now? ...Are you going to go in?\"\nAt the very least, Jin could tell that Lee Shin Woo was wary of the senior inside. Lee Shin Woo just nodded his head... at Jin’s question.\n\"We’ve come this far, so we can’t just turn back. If they’re one of Ethan’s agents, then all the more reason for us to take him down.\"\n\"...Yeah, if need be, we can just kill him I guess.\"\n\"Nah, I’m not going to kill him.\"\nLee Shin Woo was sure that Jin hadn’t forgotten about their encounter with the Archmage the other day, and his resulting death. He softly gave Jin a dutch rub and then... placed his hand atop Jin’s head.\n\"Let’s go, Jin.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nDozens of lightning arrows appeared in the air. It was the Breath of the Lightning God’s option, Thunder Arrow. It was quite an efficient skill, as it only consumed a small amount of mana to consume a large quantity of controllable arrows.\n\"Heup!\"\nLee Shin Woo controlled the thunder arrows telekinetically, and shot them at the boss room door. The arrows battered the door together, and although they didn’t break through the giant stone gate, the arrows managed to weaken the sides, allowing them to enter.\nThere was a calm-looking skeleton within.\n[I didn’t think an undead would come into the dungeon.]\nThe skeleton’s bones had turned black, and wore a robe adorned with luxurious gemstones above them. And in the place of eyes, he had green gems... emeralds embedded. It really looked like a Lich that came out of a game. Whether it was fortunate or not he couldn’t tell, but it wasn’t a Lich. If he destroyed its main body, it would die.\n[You seem to be quite a high level... Are you as powerful as one of the 12 generals?]\n\"Nope.\"\nConsidering the fact that he could talk to it, the skeleton had definitely retained its intellect. Even though it retained its intellect, he had no proof that it was still sane, so Lee Shin Woo didn’t drop his combat readiness. But it wasn’t like he could attack it right away. First off, he would have to show his respect to his senior.\n\"I’m someone who opposes them.\"\n[Opposing the 12 generals? It’s been a long time since I’ve heard something so funny. An undead that opposes the Empire... Are you perhaps connected with Ethan Cruz? No, if you were working together with Ethan, then you wouldn’t have been able to find this place...]\nThe undead raised its staff, embedded with a large emerald, and aimed it at Lee Shin Woo while speaking cautiously.\n[Are you a hero?]\n\"...It seems like you’re still self-aware.\"\nLee Shin Woo hadn’t met an undead hero until now that had been self-aware (that they were a hero) and acted accordingly before he could even convince them. He’d thought that perhaps a case like this would come up in the future, but... He couldn’t feel relaxed yet. At least now he had a chance to figure out how to approach this situation.\n[Then, you too?]\n\"I’m Paul Zero. ...If you’re not hostile, then I’d like to talk to you. How about it?\"\nLee Shin Woo withdrew his Breath of the Lightning God and spoke (though of course, the second he saw something strange, he was prepared to counterattack). The skeleton likewise withdrew its staff. He was definitely a lot different from the undead he’d met until now. No... perhaps it was different from any of the undead he had met.\n[Well, well. This is quite surprising for me as well. Alright. Let’s talk... Oh, right. My name.]\nIt stroked its face with its free hand and replied.\n[...My name is Lee Man Bok.]\nA familiar name popped up!",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 30 part6",
    "content": "<Chapter 30. Hero Hunter - 6>\nAccording to Lee Man Bok, he was part of the first hero group that was summoned. He had been a typical company employee in Seoul, South Korea, and when he was summoned, he asked that God give him the ability to use magic. Fortunately, he had a high aptitude for magic, so he was able to win every battle in the Empire.\n[That young lady was beautiful. The one who’s in charge of the shop...]\n\"...Pleine.\"\nHe’d thought about it for a bit, but in order for their conversation to progress smoothly, he added more background information. That the wandering knight, Paul Zero, was once a hero (honestly, Shino Rendu and Bisher Moon had guessed the same)!\nBut here, an unexpected truth was revealed.\n[She never told me her name, but it seems like you two are quite close.]\n\"...Is that so?\"\nIf he had just brought her a bottle of wine, she would’ve told him her name. Unfortunately, it seemed like he hadn’t been aware of that fact.\n[But thanks. Pleine... It fits her, as she had such sparkling eyes. Now that I know, I’m happy.]\n\"It seems like you really liked her.\"\n[There’s no way the other heroes couldn’t like her. Unlike down here, which was teeming with the undead, the secret shop had her warm smile and was overflowing with life. Above all, she was the only one who could safely give us food.]\n\"Well, that’s true...\"\nLee Shin Woo couldn’t relate, and Lee Man Bok spoke of Pleine in the past-tense, while he could see her whenever he wanted, so it was really tough to listen to, but with his level 17 Acting skill, he was able to bear with it.\nLee Man Bok was wondering whether he could really trust Lee Shin Woo or not, as he gazed at him. Lee Shin Woo looked completely natural.\n[It’s been a long time since I felt like this, but when I think back to that time, I feel happy. Back then, I thought I could do anything. It felt like I’d become the protagonist of a fantasy novel. I thought I was the only one with unique skills, unique equipment... Everything was exactly as I’d dreamed it to be.]\nThat’s right. When summoned to this world, most earthlings would feel that way. They wouldn’t become skeletons like Lee Shin Woo! Lee Shin Woo suddenly recollected the moment he’d been sent to the Empire and gritted his teeth.\nIt was his own fault and it pissed him off that he couldn’t complain about it to anyone!\n\"Since God’s blessing is supernatural. It’s a power that can easily enable you to overcome a level difference in a specific situation.\"\n[Yeah, it was indeed. You’re right, I put too much faith into her blessing...]\nFirstly, this was all information that Lee Shin Woo couldn’t have known unless he was a hero. Secondly, Lee Shin Woo looked incredibly reasonable. Therefore, Lee Man Bok was able to trust him. To be honest, Lee Shin Woo was using his Instigate skill here, but Lee Man Bok wasn’t able to figure that out. That was the power of Instigate.\n[...Those good times passed by in a flash. I got to level 7, and... despite her, Pleine, telling us not to, we (the heroes) arrogantly challenged the 12 generals. However, the darkness that covered the Empire was truly deep and vast... In the end, we lost to them and became undead.]\n\"And then?\"\nThat’s right. This was the important part. After all, wasn’t Lee Shin Woo the one who killed all of the undead heroes? Lee Man Bok saw Lee Shin Woo’s goblin fire burn, gravely nodded his head, and spoke.\n[Of course, I didn’t regain consciousness immediately. At the beginning, the moment I degenerated into an undead, I instinctively began to hate humans... and wanted to follow the Emperor. Honestly, they welcomed us. To the point that it felt like we had never even fought against each other before...]\n\"Hoo...\"\nHis words caused Lee Shin Woo to automatically recollect the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin, and shook. As expected, incorporating the heroes into their forces had been going on for a long time.\n\"And then?\"\n[Ethan Cruz saved us. No, to be exact, my comrades and I... he infused his darkness magic into us and returned our sanity.]\nEthan Cruz, who hadn’t spoken, didn’t have a special ability, and was a junior that no one was interested in, possessed such a terrifying ability; Lee Man Bok remembered how surprised he was, and smiled bitterly. It was a feeling Lee Shin Woo could understand, even if he was learning about it after the fact.\n[And so, we ran. We ran so hectically with him... But as we ran, we felt it. He was trying to destroy our minds and turn us into his subordinates. Ironically, at that moment, I was able to advance myself as a magician, and punish him for his dirty tricks.]\n\"Were you not able to kill him?\"\n[Unfortunately... Once he realized he was at a disadvantage, he used my comrades, who were now under his control, as human shields and retreated. I confronted them and we fought, and I was somehow able to return their minds to them, but... he was already nowhere to be found.]\nSo it seems like Ethan Cruz wasn’t a monstrous level 8 dozens of years ago. He was inexperienced, so contrary to his intentions, Lee Man Bok had awakened and had regained his sanity. Lee Shin Woo listened to his story, and wondered whether there were traces of Ethan Cruz’s darkness magic within Lee Man Bok, but there wasn’t.\n[After that, a few things happened, but... Ultimately, I hid here. It was extremely safe, and it was a hidden base. Though I had no idea you would find it.]\n\"Why are you just staying here? You don’t want to take revenge on the 12 generals who killed you, or Ethan Cruz, who tried to control you?\"\n[Revenge? ...Haha.]\nLee Man Bok chuckled at Lee Shin Woo’s question. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo knew that he’d failed to convince Lee Man Bok. As expected, Lee Man Bok shrugged his shoulders and weakly spoke.\n[Surprisingly... In my last fight, I learned something I really didn’t want to know. At that moment, I lost all my lingering attachments. I had a taste of something that went beyond anger: despondence.]\n\"...\"\n[All my lingering attachments from my old world, as a hero, and even those as an undead... My hate towards Ethan Cruz? That’s the only thing that still remains, but I don’t want to risk my life for that and go outside again.]\nWhat exactly made him hide in here? In any case, Lee Shin Woo was sure that Lee Man Bok didn’t look at God favorably. It wouldn’t be a good idea to stimulate his mental state. If that’s the case, then...\n\"Ethan Cruz is aiming for our junior heroes again. I’m aware of this, so I’m trying to stop him. Your juniors, who were put into exactly the same state as you were dozens of years ago, are sinless, yet... you have no intention of helping them?\"\n[None.]\nBut his plan, which targeted Lee Man Bok’s compassion, didn’t work at all. Lee Man Bok’s voice was quite cold.\n[Leave them be, so that they can overcome that danger on their own. I don’t know how you were able to remain so sane, but what you’re trying to do won’t matter. There’s no reason to follow God’s command and struggle in death. It’ll be... in vain.]\n\"...I’m not trying to follow God’s command.\"\n’Is it really ok for me to tell him this,’ Lee Shin Woo thought as the words thoughtlessly came out of his mouth. He had said it on a whim, as he was displeased that someone so strong was just sitting on their ass. ’Well, I suppose it’s good to say as a Joker,’ he thought, and spoke.\n\"I just want to become so strong that no one can order me to do anything. So I’ll say it again, I... just want to be free. What about you?\"\n[Free... That’d be nice. Much better than living here in hiding.]\nLee Man Bok respected his intent, but didn’t empathize with him.\n[However, you’ll soon regret it as well. This world is illogical, and in a world like that, there’s absolutely no reason to fight. Whether it be with a living body, an undead body... we’ll never get what we want. ...I’m fine where I am. I don’t want to think about anything else anymore.]\n\"...Is that so?\"\nAround that time, Lee Shin Woo gave up on Lee Man Bok, and Lee Man Bok realized that. ’What fickleness,’ he thought, and asked something he hadn’t intended on asking. The most update n0vels are published on nοvelfire.net\n[You said you were going to help your juniors, right?]\n\"Yeah.\"\n[If that’s the case, you’ll soon realize. How pointless it is.]\nLee Man Bok smiled. He was a skeleton that looked like him, yet when he smiled, he looked this terrifying.\n[This world drives everyone insane. The undead hate the living, and the living hate the undead. It’s too late. Our juniors won’t see us as seniors, they’ll just see us as undead. As undead they have to defeat. As undead that cannot be trusted! Nothing you say can convince them. The longer you live here, the more evidence there is to support it... In the end, you just become part of the darkness, without being able to do anything.]\n\"I have a rough idea. However, I’m sure I can overcome it.\"\n[If you’re going to be that stubborn, let me give you one last piece of advice. ...Be careful of Seira Von Retadane.]\nSeira Von Retadane? That’s quite a surprising name to hear here. Lee Shin Woo raised his head and he saw Lee Man Bok gritting his teeth.\n[Nothing you say will be able to convince that lunatic, so try not to even cross paths... I’m telling you to kill her before she takes notice of you.]\n\"Thanks for the advice. Anything else? I’m going to go find others who are in the same situation as us.\"\n[The Giants’ domain. My old comrades are there. If you can convince them, they’ll be of great help to you. Though it’ll be extremely difficult to find them.]\nAha, he was wondering. Lee Shin Woo naturally nodded his head. There were only two other undead heroes, aside from Lee Man Bok in the level 4 danger zone, yet he was wondering why they were so close to each other. And that place intersected with his memories from the giant.\n’If they’re the giants’ descendants, then it makes sense.’\nHe’d already decided that he would go over there sometime, but what great timing! Lee Shin Woo smiled in satisfaction. Jin shook, but he didn’t let that worry him.\n[Are you leaving?]\n\"I have to.\"\n[Bye.]\n\"Yeah. Bye.\"\nLee Shin Woo nodded his head and thrust his Breath of the Thunder God, burrowing his blade within Lee Man Bok’s skull. He activated his high speed thrust skill, Shadow Horn, and coupled with the lightning in their surroundings, the strike was so fast that Lee Man Bok couldn’t respond to it!\nWhen he added in his recent Mana Acceleration skill, it looked like there were no signs and it was as if he had lunged at light speed!\n[Critical Hit!]\n[Keok!?]\nA high rank level 7 magician. Unfortunately, one hit of Shadow Horn was enough to penetrate the magic protecting Lee Man Bok’s body. One of the emeralds that were embedded in his eyes burst out of its eye socket.\nThat wasn’t all. The six Breath of the Lightning Gods behind him altogether burrowed into Lee Man Bok’s body. Who else could execute such a perfect surprise attack? It was to the point that a top assassin would be shocked at the sight.\n[W-Why...!?]\n\"I found you, so what are the chances that someone else doesn’t? I have no idea when I might face you as an enemy, so when you said ’I’m going to just hide here and live my life’, did you think I would be like, ’Yes, do you as wish’?\"\n[T-That’s...]\nBefore Lee Man Bok’s staff could even emit light, Lee Shin Woo kicked it away. He had somewhat expected this, but because he hadn’t fought in actual combat, or perhaps because he was rusty, he was incredibly slow. He was prepared to get hit by one spell. How disappointing.\n[How could I be beaten so easily...!?]\n\"Why didn’t you just show up as an enemy? I’d rather have that than you just incessantly talking about such heavy stuff.\"\nLee Shin Woo exploded all of his Breath of the Lightning Gods at once. The level 6 weapons blew up right before him, but he wasn’t damaged in the least from the resulting explosion. That meant that he could control lightning that naturally.\n[Ku...ga...]\n\"At least you were hiding a trick up your sleeve.\"\nHowever, the moment that Lee Man Bok’s robe shined, his almost fully broken skull regenerated. At the same time, Lee Shin Woo felt a considerable amount of mana being concentrated into him and nodded his head. He gathered lightning mana that came about due to the explosion in one hand, and used Shadow Horn once more. It would be difficult for a trained magician to recycle mana like he did.\n[Kuheuk!]\nContrary to Hansen Von Dorthe’s technique, Lee Shin Woo created a true ’Lightning Shadow’ and mercilessly pierced through Lee Man Bok’s skull, completely destroying it. His attack, which used lightning concentrated to its very limit, as well as shadow, had overcome physics and had sublimated into something else!\n[You have acquired 2 secret shop permits, and 45,591,340 Perium.]\n[You have given peace to a comrade who walked a path he could not return from. You have partially cleared the quest objectives, and have acquired 1 secret shop permit. The maximum level of the Invisible Heart skill has increased by 1.]\nThis time, he had completely finished his job. Lee Shin Woo sighed and snatched the robes from the ground. They were definitely a treasure, considering the fact that they retained their shape despite the explosion.\n[You have acquired the Lv6 Sage’s Regret. Through Bone Reinforcement, it has become the Lv7 Prayer of the Dead!]\n\"Holy crap. It turned into a level 7 artifact! Jin, look at this. It’s like bone powder clumped up to make the robes, and the way it sways, it’s like what a final boss wears... What’s wrong?\"\n\"...I thought you two would be good friends.\"\n\"Nope. It was just an act to make him drop his guard and make it easier for me to launch a surprise attack...\"\n\"Give me back my feelings!\"\nReality is always cruel. Lee Shin Woo had disrespectfully forced a hermit senior to go to his eternal rest!",

    "content": "<Chapter 30. Hero Hunter - 7>\nOne never knew what would happen in the Underground Empire. In this world, there wasn’t a problem with dichotomous thinking: they’re either friend or foe.\n\"It’s laughable that he believed that he wouldn’t be discovered when he hadn’t even made the dungeon secure. He only survived this long because he was lucky.\"\nThere was only one reason Lee Shin Woo had killed Lee Man Bok. Even though Lee Man Bok had regained his sanity after turning into an undead, he lived such a leisurely life and didn’t have a clear vision of the future. Not only that, he didn’t even think about anything else, hated everything, and just sat on his ass... He was nothing more than a walking corpse; he was already dead.\nWhen the battle with the Empire intensified, then this guy would either die to the 12 generals or to one of the other heroes. If not, then he’d face Ethan Cruz, who was incomparably more powerful than before and would be controlled this time for sure. Rather than let him be stolen by someone else, he’d rather just kill him now.\n\"Even so, you just went and killed him right away? You couldn’t convince him?\"\n\"Were you not listening? I did try to convince him. I even told him about myself.\"\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t a psychopath. He had told Lee Man Bok about the Empire’s circumstances, how his juniors were faring, Ethan Cruz’s evil, and even his own dreams as well. Lee Man Bok’s reaction to all of that was... it would’ve been better if he hadn’t heard any of it.\n\"If he’s disappointed in God and the heroes, then he should struggle to do something, but this guy didn’t do anything. He just couldn’t pass on. He should’ve known that he couldn’t just hide forever, yet even so, he didn’t move or do anything. ...So, I just gave him the death that he so desperately wished for.\"\n\"...Shin Woo, you really are cruel.\"\n\"You said I was kind before.\"\n\"You can be cruel and kind at the same time.\"\nLee Shin Woo told Jin to study up on the Empire’s common language again, and Jin, pissed off, forcefully kicked him. Of course, only Jin himself was hurt by the kick.\nWhile Jin was groaning, Lee Shin Woo picked up the emerald staff that had rolled onto the floor. Surprisingly, it was a level 5 artifact. His other seniors were satisfied with just one level 5 artifact, yet Lee Man Bok had possessed level 6 armor and a level 5 weapon; were the first heroes really this lavish!?\n\"Ah, it transformed through Bone Reinforcement, but it didn’t level up or down... Anyway, with this, I should be able to reinforce my staff.\"\n\"There’s a bone over there too.\"\n\"There are two bones! Since Bone Reinforcement’s level keeps going up, the chance of me getting two bones is increasing...!\"\n\"You being so happy about this makes you seem even worse.\"\nWhen a magician-type undead was killed, they would usually drop their skull, and surprisingly, Lee Man Bok had dropped a rib bone as well. Lee Shin Woo thought about absorbing both of them simultaneously, but decided against it, choosing to absorb the skull first.\n[Consuming the Lv7 Lee Man Bok’s skull to reinforce your skull. Magic has increased by 38. Due to your high affinity with the target, Bone Reinforcement is a resounding success! Absorbing the majority of the target’s memories and experiences.]\n[My magical aptitude is... Hoo, I’m a Wind Magician, huh? Nice. I’m just like the main character in a novel! At first, wind seems like the weakest element, but there’s actually a trick hidden within... Nice, nice, it’s perfect! - Lee Man Bok]\nHe thought he’d have a high affinity with Lee Man Bok, and true to form, he absorbed a significant amount of information. Because Lee Shin Woo could now understand how a magician thought... No, that wasn’t all.\nJin wouldn’t know, but Lee Man Bok was born in the same country of origin as Lee Shin Woo, so their compatibility was incredible. As a result, Bone Reinforcement was a resounding success and he was able to absorb most of Lee Man Bok’s memories and experiences. He absorbed his struggles, his love, and his despair as well.\n’Throw away anything I don’t need and... Yeah. Wind Resistance. I thought it was about time I got this resistance.’\nLee Man Bok was a high level magician who could use high rank wind magic! Of course, he couldn’t match up to Kratia, who had studied magic ever since she was young, but as Lee Man Bok’s skills were trained in the field, they were no joke. ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ novelFirｅ.net\nMoreover, wind magic was renowned for its quick cast time and manifestation. Perhaps that was why Lee Man Bok had been so relaxed while conversing with Lee Shin Woo, as he could react quickly if need be.\nOf course, Lee Man Bok hadn’t realized that Lee Shin Woo’s lightning was even faster, so there was no way he could have avoided a futile death!\n[You have learned High Rank Wind Lv1 and High Rank Wind Resistance Lv1! Magic has increased by 150.]\nLee Shin Woo sorted through Lee Man Bok’s memories and experiences, and when he had found what he was looking for, Lee Shin Woo gained a new power that he could naturally use.\nAnd with it, his interior mana increased sharply, but he was used to it by now. Because he had a long way to go, he didn’t think much of a 150 stat increase in magic anymore. Of course, if another hero were to have heard this, they would be shocked.\n\"Jin, you come over here too.\"\n\"Why!?\"\n\"You probably can’t get the element from this, but you should be able to get the resistance out of it, so come here.\"\n\"Uguuu...\"\nJin wept, knowing how important elemental resistance was and left his body in Lee Shin Woo’s hands. Once he was finishing with Jin’s reinforcement, Jin had successfully acquired intermediate level 7 wind resistance, and Lee Shin Woo’s magic had risen by another 10.\n\"Guaaaaaaaah.\"\n\"Jin, if you’re going to roll on the floor, could you at least put a rag on top or something?\"\nLee Shin Woo spoke indifferently, as Jin suffered the aftereffects of Bone Reinforcement, and checked the remaining loot.\nAs expected, the level 5 staff strengthened the wind element, and once he absorbed it, he gained around 40 magic and the staff fused with the Bifurcated Snake Spine within Bone Armory. But then, an unexpected change came about.\n[You are now able to summon the Lv6 Bone Winged Serpent!]\n\"Huh?\"\n[Bone Winged Serpent]\n[Lv6]\n[Durability: 1,860/1,860]\n[Attack Power: 450 - 610]\n[Magic Attack Power: 1,350 - 1,550]\n[Options: Calculation Assistance]\n[Passive skill: Serpent’s Whirlwind - Absorbs an element and shoots out the opposite element with even greater strength.]\nLee Shin Woo thought the fusion would either add an option that strengthened the wind element, or increased the magic attack power of the staff, but the actual result was quite unexpected. When he saw the upgraded skill though, he did think of one thing.\n’Now that I think about it, I think there’s a passage in a bible that states ’sow the wind, and reap the whirlwind’.’\nIt wasn’t often used in the west anymore, but it was similar to the Korean adage. He smiled, as the skill was exactly like the adage.\n’Wind is not only fast and sharp, but it also possesses the ability to reinforce other things as well... As I thought, no useless element exists.’\nTo be honest, Lee Shin Woo had thought that the lightning element was backward compatible with the wind element, thinking of it as just another ’variation of the wind element’. However, now that he’d gotten the wind element, he felt like he would need to do some in-depth study of the actual element itself. It wasn’t that there wasn’t anything special about the wind element; it was just that there was nothing special about Lee Man Bok!\nContrary to Lee Man Bok, whose only specialty was creating wind, by obtaining both his memories and experiences, Lee Shin Woo was able to manipulate the very element itself and could use the element to its fullest! ’The student has become the master.’\n\"Next up is this...\"\nHonestly, Lee Shin Woo’s main concern hadn’t been the wind strengthening staff. When he had first found the level 7 artifact, he had been a bit anxious, and he raised that very artifact before his eyes.\nCountless particles of bone powder were clumped together into the shape of a robe that was often worn by magicians. Even now, it changed its shape right before his very eyes, deceiving those that looked at it. It seemed as though there was a gemstone mixed in, as something was dazzling within it. The robes were both frightening and charming at the same time.\n[Prayer of the Dead]\n[Lv7]\n[Durability: 1,980/1,980 (Self-Repair)]\n[Defense: 700 - 900]\n[Options: Health + 40, Magic + 100, Calculation Assistance, Magic Reinforcement, High-speed Casting]\n[Special Passive skill: Blessing of Death - You store others’ death energy and using that death energy, you can prevent your own death. Current charge: 0/1]\nLee Shin Woo rubbed his eyes and checked once more, but the information didn’t change. Setting aside its options, this robe... Its skill had the same name as Jin’s revival ability!\n\"Jin, this robe has the Blessing of Death ability.\"\n\"What the hell!? That’s bullshit!\"\nBut contrary to Jin, who could draw in the curse and avoid death, these robes not only had to store another person’s death energy but could only revive a person once, as it could store one charge maximum. That sucked, but in any case, it was a big deal to avoid death even once.\nThe original robe probably had a skill that was a rank lower than the current skill. However, it was because of that skill that Lee Man Bok was able to regenerate from Lee Shin Woo’s attack. Perhaps this skill was the reason he was able to escape from Ethan Cruz.\n\"Blessing of Death, huh...\"\nLee Shin Woo momentarily looked over the item, and soon stored it into the Bone Armory. His health and magic stats rose, and all of the remaining options, as well as the robe itself, was stored into the Bone Armory intact.\nHe immediately switched out one of his Breaths of the Lightning Gods with the Prayer of the Dead and draped it over his armor. This robe, which was composed of bone powder, could transform, so it wouldn’t get in the way of his movements.\nThe High-Speed Casting, Calculation Assistance and Magic Reinforcement would be quite helpful to Lee Shin Woo, even though he wasn’t a magician. There was nothing more reassuring than having a level 7 piece of equipment draped over him. He was equipped with a level 6 weapon, and though most of his armor was level 4, he had another piece of armor that was level 7. If the other heroes knew about this, they would be jealous and cry tears of blood. No, his items would even shock the 12 generals!\n\"I gained various info and even acquired some artifacts as well, so our senior really didn’t die in vain...\"\n\"I don’t think he would’ve agreed with you...\"\nLee Shin Woo didn’t really care what the dead thought, and they realized that there were no traces of them having been here. They were about to leave but... they found a few volumes of books atop a roughly made table within the boss room.\nThey were all written by Lee Man Bok.\n\"You’re not taking these with you, Shin Woo?\"\n\"They’re not skill books. They’re probably useless...\"\nHe said as much, yet he took the books with him. Lee Man Bok had been chosen as a hero, so even though he likely learned the Empire’s language, it would be written in Korean. When he actually took a look at it, it was indeed written in Korean, but the contents were so childish and immature that he just grinned. He was whining like a little kid.\n\"Shin Woo, what did he write?\"\n\"Not sure. I don’t know what the language is, so I can’t read it.\"\n\"You’re lying, aren’t you? His name is similar to yours. You’re from the same country, aren’t you!? Right!?\"\n\"I’m not. Now, let’s go to the Giant’s domain that our senior was so helpful in telling us about. Jin, hurry up.\"\n\"Liar. If you can’t understand it, then why are you sitting there, reading it so earnestly? Hey!\"\nLee Shin Woo didn’t reply to Jin’s question and instead tapped Jin’s back to urge him to go while continuing to read Lee Man Bok’s diary. Ultimately, Jin grumblingly left the dungeon and began to run, while Lee Shin Woo absent-mindedly read Lee Man Bok’s diary and despondently chuckled.",

    "content": "<Chapter 31. Giants’ Domain - 1>\nLee Shin Woo was shaken while atop of Jin’s back for two days, and when he raised his head from Lee Man Bok’s diary, he suddenly realized that...\n\"This is a bit weird.\"\n\"That’s a relief, I thought the same.\"\nThey were running across a mountainous area. The area was rugged, befitting a level 4 danger zone, and everywhere they looked, they saw mountains, hills, canyons, and cliffs, so they couldn’t figure out exactly where they were if they didn’t check their minimap.\nBut it was really strange; when they actually checked their minimap, it seemed like they hadn’t budged, even though a few hours had passed!\n\"We should’ve gotten out by now.\"\n\"Are we lost?\"\n\"No, we’re not, considering the fact that we keep seeing things we haven’t before. In my opinion, it’s just...\"\nLee Shin Woo thought ’surely not’, stretched out his hand, and sensed the flow of mana. Mm, as he expected, the flow of mana wasn’t normal. The inflow rate was too high, causing the remaining mana to feel unusually twisted. Even if they took into account that it was a level 4 danger zone, there was still a tremendous amount of mana concentrated in this area.\n\"I didn’t think it was possible, but... the density of mana is so high that the space is naturally expanding.\"\n\"Like the training facility?\"\n\"It’s expanding much less than the training facility, but it’s still huge. I assume that’s why it feels like we’re not getting anywhere when we look at the minimap.\"\n\"It’s not a dungeon or even an artificial facility, yet the environment naturally expanded. The Empire’s really no joke...\"\nIf this could happen, then anything was possible in the Empire. Like what they were experiencing right now, where the limited space was expanding and the natural environment thrived within, or space itself was strangely interconnected. If not, then there was space being hidden...\n\"Maybe the Giants’ domain is like that too. Since I’ve never heard of the Giants’ domain from our seniors before...\"\n\"But Shin Woo, shouldn’t we be worrying about getting out of this place, not the Giants’ domain?\"\n\"Even I don’t know how to cut down space as it expands.\"\n\"But at this rate, we’ll just be wandering around for the next few days. That’s fine with me, but won’t it throw a wrench in your plans?\"\n\"Mm...\"\nIt was a fair point. Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and activated his mana. There was something he could fall back on. Mana Bone had leveled up through Bone Reinforcement and Lee Shin Woo had gained the ability to resist spatial magic; he definitely remembered seeing that line.\n’It might’ve formed naturally, but this is still clearly spatial magic. No... the mana’s even more primitive.’\nHe couldn’t categorize the mana by element. It just had a unique flow. The mana used for spatial magic wasn’t entirely different from this mana. Therefore, it was even more difficult to sense spatial magic and resist it.\n’The flow of mana... if I can sense a portion of it and twist it around, then...’\nThis wasn’t something that could be solved by Lee Shin Woo filling the surrounding area with his mana, as he wouldn’t be able to entirely affect the vast area. Lee Shin Woo needed to find where the flow of mana was weak. In other words, the part that he could break.\n\"Almost done?\"\n\"It’s not that simple.\"\n\"You can do it.\"\nJust hearing Lee Shin Woo say it’s hard made Jin completely give up on listening to Lee Shin Woo and went back to his own business. In other words, he left Lee Shin Woo to think and he just continued to run forward.\nJin planned on laughing at him if he were to get them out of here before Lee Shin Woo could come up with something.\n\"Ah, so that’s how it is.\" Thıs content belongs to novel★fire.net\nBut unfortunately, Lee Shin Woo, who was talented in mana, suddenly realized what ’resisting’ meant.\nTo be exact, he realized that the way he looked at the world and the mana within it had changed, as well as how that was linked to spatial magic.\n\"Yeah... No matter how overpowering the mana controlling this space is, not all of the mana follows that flow. Moreover, when I look at it from a world view, then this flow is nothing more than a single branch. In other words, I need to see the main current, the original flow of mana.\"\n\"Mm, I have no idea what you’re saying.\"\n\"For example, a checkered coat is extremely popular for a single season, but you have to be able to find the guy who always wears the same plain shirt.\"\n\"It makes sense!?\"\nLee Shin Woo’s explanation caused Jin to shake, and Jin yelled in shock. He just left Jin alone and earnestly began to look for the plain shirt... the original flow of mana.\nAnd he began to understand what it meant to resist the space’s mana. After all, this flow of mana, which twisted and manipulated this space, and piled up on top of each other, could only be resisted if he classified and detected it!\n\"But it’s still really hard. Damn...!\"\n\"Hey, you know that old-fashioned people usually stay the course and don’t change.\"\n\"Who’s the one actually looking for the plain shirt right now?\"\nHowever, Jin’s words were actually helpful. Lee Shin Woo turned his attention from the misleading flow of mana and concentrated on the hidden, yet continuous flow of mana.\n\"Shin Woo?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Shin Woo, are you ok?\"\nOf course, it wasn’t possible with just sight. He had to feel for the mana with his entire body, and he didn’t submit, even though the mana threatened to carry him away; Lee Shin Woo attempted to feel for the other flow of mana that came towards him.\nHe succeeded, even though it was his first attempt. Lee Shin Woo didn’t even know how much time had passed and was able to focus entirely on the flow of mana. Though it did take him a few hours.\n\"Are you almost done...?\"\n\"...Yeah, I think I’m done.\"\nAt some point, Lee Shin Woo, who had been in deep thought, opened his eyes wide open. It seemed like a joke, as it had only been a few hours, but Lee Shin Woo now roughly understood the concept behind the space.\n\"Run forward, Jin.\"\n\"That’s what I’ve been doing.\"\n\"No, it’ll be different.\"\nLee Shin Woo placed a hand atop Jin’s back and connected their mana together. Lee Shin Woo used this method to borrow mana from Jin when he hadn’t had enough mana in the past.\nHowever, he wasn’t borrowing mana this time. Instead, he was making their mana as one.\n\"Alright, now the main current of mana will lead us.\"\n\"I’m not really sure what’s going on, but I guess I’ll just run for now.\"\nJin replied honestly and ran. Then, the surrounding landscape quickly began to change. Jin was, of course, always this fast, so the passing landscape was a blur, but the scale was different. Within the blink of an eye, they would pass by mountains, rocks, valleys, and cliffs.\n\"Wait, what’s going on...?\"\n\"It doesn’t matter how we move in this space. What does matter is which mana flow we follow.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s goblin fire swayed tremendously as he explained this to the shocked Jin. To be honest, he’d just gotten a feel for it himself, so even if he wanted to explain it in detail, he really couldn’t.\n\"I don’t get it.\"\n\"It’s tough for me to explain, so just think of it as us taking a shortcut.\"\nIt was roughly similar to the Scar of the Wind (Kaze no Kizu) in Inuyasha, where Inuyasha finds the rift between yokai auras and swings the Tessaiga into that rift, releasing an energy wave. At least, that’s what he wanted to say, but it seemed like Jin wouldn’t understand the reference, so he decided against it.\n\"Hoo, I feel a lot better now. The minimap’s finally moving.\"\n\"We’re close to the Giants’ domain. We avoided wasting time as you said.\"\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo had checked in the chatting channel and Ethan Cruz hadn’t finished formulating his hunting plan. After all, it wasn’t easy to find one of the 12 generals and lead him to them.\nStill, he was moving more actively towards that goal, and because he didn’t know when Ethan Cruz would call for them, he wanted to pursue his task... killing all the undead heroes as quickly as possible.\n\"Is this the right way?\"\n\"Yeah. Run.\"\nThe Giants’ domain. It’d be great if he could get what he wanted from there... he thought and raised his head. For a moment, Lee Shin Woo’s goblin fire swayed tremendously. There was an incredibly large snow-covered mountain in between their destination and them.\n\"What’s with this all of a sudden...?\"\n\"Should we go another way?\"\n\"Seems like something’s inside, right? Let’s go a different way.\"\nNormally, Lee Shin Woo would say ’It’s a chance to raise my Ice Resistance to high rank’ and would tell Jin to charge forward, but the situation was different right now. Regrettably, he thought that avoiding it was the better move.\n’Plus, with a mountain that distinctive, the other seniors must’ve been interested and lured in.’\nLee Shin Woo had that thought, opened a private chat with Prince and asked about the snow-covered mountain in the level 4 danger zone. There was way too much he didn’t want to be revealed to Ethan Cruz in the chatting channel.\n[Prince Altania: A snow-covered mountain? What snow-covered mountain?]\n\"You don’t know about it?\"\n[Prince Altania: I’ve never even heard about it. Moreover, I’ve never heard about it from my seniors either... Wait a sec, I’ll go and ask Lloyd.]\n\"No, it’s fine. I just saw it in passing.\"\nIf it were a famous area, then Prince would know what he was talking about. As Lee Shin Woo was concerned that there would be an information leak, he spoke curtly and Prince acted pompous like always.\n[Prince Altania: Seriously... now you’re calling me for such trivial matters? It seems like you really wanted to hear my voice, but unfortunately, it’s not that easy to hear my original voice.]\n\"I’d really like to hear it when we meet again.\"\n[Prince Altania: Huh!? Keut...!]\nPrince was flustered from Lee Shin Woo’s response and he took that chance to quickly say ’see you later’ before leaving the chatting channel. As expected, she was fun to tease. Lee Shin Woo smiled joyfully and Jin began his ’thorny rodeo’ again.\n\"Hey, stop for a sec.\"\n\"I’m not going to stop until you start crying or beg... Huh?\"\nWhen Jin, who had been tormenting Lee Shin Woo with Steel Heart, innocently raised his head... there was another snow-covered mountain right before their very eyes, like the one they’d seen before.\n\"Did I go the wrong way?\"\n\"No, you went the right way. We were definitely trying to go around it.\"\n\"Then that means there’s something wrong with the space again, right? Why are there so many of these things in the level 4 danger zone!?\"\nIt was quite frustrating to Jin, whose original wish was to run without pause. Lee Shin Woo looked back and gently closed his eyes, but then, looked forward again and shook his head.\n\"I don’t think it’s a different mountain. I think it’s all part of one mountain.\"\n\"One whole mountain? So you’re saying that we got here because you solved the puzzle?\"\n\"Yeah, to be exact...\"\nLee Shin Woo sensed the flow of mana that led them to the snow-covered mountain. Now, that mana was fused with Jin and Lee Shin Woo’s mana and was flowing quite naturally, but even if they were to leave here, the flow of mana would lead them straight back here.\n\"That place that we passed was designed to hide this snow-covered mountain... If we hadn’t followed that flow of mana, then we’d never have even found this place. This area was completely hidden within that complex flow of mana.\"\n\"So what do we do now? Should we go through the mountain?\"\n\"That’s probably the best choice. ...It seems like that’s what we’ve been looking for.\"\nLee Shin Woo checked his minimap once more and smiled bitterly, dumbfounded.\nHe’d expected this to happen. The marks indicating the location of the two final remaining undead heroes were pointing inside the snow-covered mountain.",

    "content": "<Chapter 31. Giants’ Domain - 2>\nLee Shin Woo and Jin boldly entered the snow-covered mountain. The snow-covered mountain’s cold air was god-awful and had a huge effect on the surrounding grassy plains, so it obviously looked different from the rest of the area.\n\"The mountain’s surroundings suddenly getting so much colder shouldn’t be a natural phenomenon, this must be an issue of excessive mana concentration again...?\"\n\"Hmm, could be...\"\nLee Shin Woo tread along the seemingly infinite precipice; the cliff seemed to go on and on... With a single glance he was able to see the mountain range and felt the flow of mana being drawn and sucked in somewhere. Would there be giants, or something even more ferocious awaiting him there...\n\"I’m sure that the core that’s causing these changes in space is in here somewhere.\"\n\"That bastard’s expanding space thing is here too, isn’t it?\"\n\"Yeah, but if we want to escape that mana flow, then we’ll probably have to just leave.\"\nThe moment they stepped onto the mountain path, a frigid wind blew on them. It was incredibly cold. Fortunately, Lee Shin Woo and Jin possessed Ice Resistance, so it didn’t trouble them that much. But Rem was a different story.\n[Sensing intermediate level 3 cold air. Consuming mana to resist.]\n\"Oh, I see. You were here too. Mm... Could you come over here?\"\n[I understand, Master.]\nHe brought Rem atop his wrist, stared at it, and activated a skill. It was none other than the Assimilation skill.\n’I was thinking of trying to take Assimilation in another direction anyway.’\nThe Assimilation skill was originally the Horseback Riding skill, and as the communion ability (which was part of the Horseback Riding skill) developed to its very limit, it affected the skill itself and allowed it to evolve into an ability that transcended the original.\nIt wasn’t a simple agreeing of both heart and mind, but rather, a sharing of mana or skills. Its range was quite wide, and he had obviously only been using it on Jin until now.\nBut as Intermediate Assimilation leveled up, he began to think that restricting his Assimilation use to just Jin was unnecessary. In other words, the issue wasn’t who the target was, but how close he was to that target!\n’And I was somewhat successful last time.’\nJust a short while ago, it happened when they had come across Prince in the training facility.\nLee Shin Woo thought Rem wouldn’t be able to escape Prince’s notice, but he had used his Assimilation and Disguise skills on it to hide it. That instinctive activation of using those two skills was quite effective, completely hiding Rem’s existence.\nStill, that was nothing more than a temporary measure to erase Rem’s presence, so the application was poor in several areas. But after that, Lee Shin Woo came to the realization that there was some latent potential in the Assimilation skill and decided that he’d train it some more sometime.\n’If I hadn’t awakened the Darkness element, then I wouldn’t have been able to even try it...’\nDarkness mana connected one individual with another and made all entities the same under its umbrella. If he could use darkness mana and the Assimilation skill together, then it shouldn’t be impossible for him to communicate and connect with his subordinates. He might even be able to use it on several of his subordinates at the same time!\n’That’s just wishful thinking at this point though.’\nIf for no other reason than to achieve that dream someday, Lee Shin Woo had no choice but to train on Rem. Lee Shin Woo sensed the unbreakable link of darkness mana between him and Rem, focused on it, and gradually activated his Assimilation skill.\nHis connection with Jin was inevitably weakened by this interaction, but fortunately, the link wasn’t severed.\n[Mm...]\nRem emitted a sound resembling a program being loaded. Lee Shin Woo concentrated even further and tried to share his level 7 Intermediate Ice Resistance with it.\nIf his Assimilation succeeded, then it shouldn’t be difficult to share his Ice Resistance.\nIf everything went according to plan, it would work! And for a split second, while he was concentrating, he felt the link between him and Rem become even firmer.\n[I sense unknown energy flowing into me from you, Master. Analyzing... It is level 7 Intermediate Ice Resistance.]\n\"Oh!\"\n[10%... 20%... Assimilation rate currently at 67%...]\nHe’d succeeded on the first try! At this point, he was scared of his own talent. Lee Shin Woo was so excited that he focused even harder on his Assimilation skill.\nLee Shin Woo hadn’t noticed this, but black mana was flickering across his body. The Darkness element was reinforcing the Assimilation skill!\n[100% Assimilation successful. I have become able to resist the cold air without consuming mana.]\n\"Nice! As I thought, as long as they have a strong connection with me, I can use Assimilation on other people!\"\n\"...Tch.\"\nFor some reason, Jin seemed to be a bit displeased, but unfortunately, Lee Shin Woo was preoccupied with the revelation of Assimilation’s new, latent potential, so he wasn’t really concerned about it. While he was at it, he decided to figure out how far he could take the Assimilation, so he was in his own little world testing out the possibilities.\nHow much time had he spent analyzing his Assimilation skill? Around the time that Rem was able to fly safely, regardless of how cold the winds became, his skill leveled up.\n[The Intermediate Assimilation skill has become Lv9, and Agility and Magic have increased by 5. The range of Assimilation widens gradually, and you can now maintain your skills with less concentration.] Read full story at novᴇlfire.net\nSuddenly, Lee Shin Woo instinctively made a fist. If his Assimilation skill evolved to the high rank level, then he might be able to maintain a connection with several people at the same time. If he were to add his Command skill in there as well, then he would be able to strengthen his subordinates to the limit!\n\"Rem, could you go scouting for me too?\"\n[Yes, Master. I believe I can now sense other entities’ energy, even if they are not golems.]\nMaybe it was just his imagination, but it felt like he spoke more positively to Rem. ’I’m probably just misunderstanding,’ he thought, yet he felt great.\n[Please maintain the connection.]\n\"Alright. Then, I’ll leave it to you.\"\nRem fluttered its wings and flew. The deeper into the mountain range they went, the colder the winds became. Now, it felt like they were continuously being attacked by an intermediate level 4 ice magic, but because Lee Shin Woo completely shared his Ice Resistance with Rem, Rem didn’t have any problems. Instead...\n\"Mm... It feels like I’m doubling my resistance training.\"\n\"Could you not say scary stuff like that?\"\n\"Now that I think about it, it’s the same when I activate skills through you. Maybe I’ve discovered an amazing combo technique!\"\nTo think that the skills he used on others through Assimilation were trained as well. He’d hit the jackpot!\nLee Shin Woo momentarily imagined bringing the more than 1,000 Pauls to this mountain range and training his Ice Resistance by sharing it with them all, but he soon discarded that idea. Not only was he unable to maintain his connection with hundreds of people yet, he didn’t want to give Naruto a bad name.\n\"So how is it? Can you share what you see too?\"\n\"Yeah. As I thought, it was the right move to use Assimilation on Rem.\"\n\"...Tch.\"\nSharing what Rem saw was quite an unusual experience. He was walking on the ground with his body, yet his eyes were looking down from the sky. This was exactly what would trigger motion sickness, but this would help train his senses too.\n[I believe I can go up even further to check.]\n’Alright. I’m counting on you.’\nIf Lee Shin Woo’s assumption was correct, then they had already entered into the Giants’ domain. It wouldn’t be strange for them to meet completely different entities at any time.\nWith Rem’s eyes, Lee Shin Woo collected information on the ground and its geographical features. He picked out the pertinent information and relayed it to Jin, which was the most optimum route for information sharing. Lee Shin Woo felt like he’d become a navigating device. But while doing so, something strange came into Rem’s sight all of a sudden.\n[Master, are you seeing this?]\n\"Yeah, I see it...\"\nThey saw a Giant on the snowy plains, which was reachable by going up one more hill.\nIt was undead of course, but that wasn’t the issue here. The real issue was the other entities fighting against that undead. Rem took it upon itself to focus its gaze.\n\"What is this? Is it the Imperial Army by any chance...?\"\n\"What are you talking about...?\"\nLee Shin Woo focused even further. He hadn’t seen wrong. The Imperial Army was fighting against an undead giant, and they were all at least level 3 elites. Obviously, the undead giant couldn’t win against them and was helplessly being pushed back.\nBut then, from another direction, knights leading more elite troops attacked it together. They were obviously all undead, but he felt a strange sense of deja vu as he looked upon the highly disciplined force. It felt like he’d seen this force somewhere before...\n’Ah.’\nHe suddenly figured it out. There were some knights mixed in that he’d seen before. From someone else’s memories... They were knights he’d seen in the memories of Metafel’s troops!\n’But why did they come here? Moreover, why are they attacking the Giants?’\nThe gears in Lee Shin Woo’s head began to turn quickly. He was sure that it wasn’t easy to access this snow-covered mountain.\nMetafel gained the title of ’12 generals’ because of his ability to gather all the mercenaries in the Empire under his command. Not only was it not possible for him to have such knowledge in mana, he didn’t even have a reason to lead his troops here.\n’In other words, it might be an imperial command. He was probably helped by someone who could read the flow of mana and find the right path...’\nAt this point, it was hard to infer anything else. What was the best way to figure this out? Lee Shin Woo pondered for a long time. He didn’t have to think very hard. He just needed to kill those guys and check their memories!\n’Plus, if I want to achieve my original goal, then... I’ll have to try rescuing that Giant!’\nNormally, with its level and its size, the Giant should’ve been able to overpower the Imperial Army, but because of the level 4 and 5 knights swarming it from all sides, it was forced on the defensive.\nIf it was level 6, then it would’ve been able to easily take care of them, regardless of how many came, but it seemed like the Giant was only a high rank level 5. Even if things didn’t go as he wanted, there was no chance it would come back to bite him!\n\"At this rate, that poor guy will die. Hurry, we got to save James!\"\n\"You’re doing it again, giving people names without thinking...\"\n\"Let’s hurry!\"\nDespite Jin knowing that Lee Shin Woo had formulated a new plan, he did as he was told and rushed towards the Giant.\nWhile running, Lee Shin Woo changed his armor into a sharp scalemail, and behind it, he wore his robe made of bone powder, which changed its form to look like a cape. Henceforth, this would be Paul Zero’s default appearance!\n\"You all, stop!\"\n[Keuk!?]\nLee Shin Woo rose atop the hill and yelled with a booming voice. The attacking undead force was shocked and turned to look at him. He had no intention of hiding his strength, so their response seemed only natural.\n\"How dare you attack a Giant... I won’t forgive you!\"\n[Do you... know about us...?]\nThe giant took notice of Lee Shin Woo as well, though one eye was completely gone while the other was halfway rotten, and he looked like he was a zombie. Lee Shin Woo was somewhat excited about how they were all focused on him, and said excitedly.\n\"I am the wielder of the Titan’s Pride, Paul Zero! All of you, get away from my brother!\"\n’Paul Zero - The Legend of the Giants’ begins now!\n...Though of course, it’s all a lie!",

    "content": "<Chapter 31. Giants’ Domain - 3>\nIn the past, Lee Shin Woo had bought a level 7 elite bone from the secret shop and absorbed it. The original owner of that bone had been Fennos, a Giant who lived within the Giants’ domain.\nAccording to Fennos’ memories, the Giants’ domain hadn’t been snowy fields like this. Though it was a rugged area where only the toughest could survive, the hills had been made up of rock back then, and the Giants used the rocky mountains as their base.\n[The Titan’s... Pride...?]\n\"That’s right. Have you not heard of me before?\"\n[Who the hell is that guy!?]\n[Are there other troops from the Imperial Army aside from us in here? Does Sir Metafel know about this already?]\nIn the past, the Giants were so powerful that no other tribe could influence them, and they also treasured their distinct culture. Fennos was the progenitor of the Giants and was the one closest to being a Titan.\nEven now, Lee Shin Woo couldn’t forget Fennos’ strong will.\n[I’m the descendant of the Titans, Fennos!]\nA Titan. It was the magic word that could bring all the Giants together, and it was their ardent wish to bring them back. However, they ultimately failed to bring them back... and the moment they realized this, the tribe began to decline.\nThat’s right. Before the curse had even covered the Empire, they were already walking on the path to ruin. Only one Giant tried to grow, even until the bitter end, but in the process of doing so, he drew the ire of too many of the other tribes and monsters. So in the end, he lost his life after fighting in a fierce battle. And in time, he had been resurrected as an undead...\n’There aren’t a lot of memories around there. I’m absolutely sure that Fennos fought against one of the heroes and died, and at the time, he was already outside of the Giants’ domain...’\nBut Fennos’ memories (of when he was still alive) were plenty right now. By just knowing what the Titans were and what they meant to the Giants, that gave him plenty of opportunities to gain their favor!\n\"I’ll say it once more. I am Paul Zero... The one who holds the Titan’s Pride!\"\n[Kuhahk!]\nLee Shin Woo said, and simultaneously shot out a fully charged Breath of the Lightning God. Surprisingly, the sword changed midair into a ridiculously large, 4 meter wide and 10 meter long thick bone shield. It was none other than the Titan’s Pride, which he’d gotten from the level 6 Steve!\n[That’s...!]\nSeeing that, the zombie giant’s eyes lit up and it yelled. He had anticipated it, but the zombie giant really did recognize the shield! Lee Shin Woo smiled in satisfaction and manipulated the Titan’s Pride.\nAs the shield retained the Breath of the Lightning God’s lightning and speed, the lightning swept away Metafel’s troops, cutting apart knights and soldiers alike. He could even use Bone Armory’s new option like this as well!\n[How can this be... Kuhahk!]\n[He has the same build as us, so how can he... Kek!]\nThe shield’s destructive capability was exceptional, as it came from its size and weight. Moreover, because of Rule of Bone, he could effectively move a bone (so long as it ’belonged’ to him) with a low mana cost whenever he wanted, and no matter how heavy it was, he could shoot it almost as quickly as the Breath of the Lightning God. As a result...\n\"I think I could just use this as a finisher!\"\n\"Wow. There’s a shield breakdancing in the middle of enemy territory. Ah, a windmill. A backspin.\"\nThe shield had become a giant weapon of mass destruction and swept away the battlefield, instantaneously annihilating the elite troops, with the knights not faring any better.\nLee Shin Woo used his lightning charged shield to kill the final remaining level 5 Elite Elder Knight Ghoul. After that, he surveyed the battlefield through Rem. Fortunately, it seemed like there weren’t any reinforcements.\n\"Brother, are you alright?\"\n[Ah, Ouuu...!]\nLee Shin Woo changed the shield back into the Breath of the Lightning God, collected all of the bones, and turned around towards the undead giant. It said, [Lv5 Sealed Titan Zombie] above its head. It didn’t indicate a ’shield’, but rather, a ’seal’. [1]\n[How did you... brother...?]\nHe’d roughly anticipated this, but the Giant didn’t really respond to Lee Shin Woo properly. At the very least, Lee Shin Woo’s utterance of the word ’Titan’, as well as summoning the Titan’s Pride had barely gotten a reaction out of him.\nThis matter wouldn’t be resolved easily, so Lee Shin Woo sighed, but Jin, who was spectating all this, was just surprised that Lee Shin Woo had gotten this much of a reaction from an undead he’d never encountered before.\n\"It seems like enemies from the outside dared to enter our (the Giant Tribe’s) territory and attack us. I’ll protect you, so let’s go to the village together.\"\n[I... got it...]\nIn what world were they part of the Giant Tribe? The Giant meekly nodded its head at Lee Shin Woo’s words, turned around, and began to move. However, this was where it would all start. Not all of the giants would have a screw loose like this one.\n\"What are you going to do? Are you going to bring that Giant along and try something? Will the other Giants trust you?\"\nJin hesitated, even though Lee Shin Woo gave the signal to follow it.\nUntil now, there had always been a chance that he could talk his way out of the situation, but Lee Shin Woo couldn’t disguise himself as a Giant yet, so Jin had no idea what made Lee Shin Woo so confident. However, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t really thinking about anything at all.\n\"Well, I showed them that I’m fighting against the Imperial Army in an attempt to make it look like we’re on the same side. It went better than I’d expected, so there’s a chance it could become a united front, and there’s also a chance it could become a three-way fight as well... Even my daughter-in-law doesn’t know how things will turn out.\"\n\"Daughter-in-law!?\"\nWas Lee Shin Woo old on Earth? With just that one word, Jin had completely forgotten about the issue with the Giants and was completely lost in thought. Lee Shin Woo just let him be and absorbed all the bones he’d gathered.\nIn the past, he would have to separate the information individually when absorbing this many bones, but it was different now.\n[Overlapping and absorbing the Lv3 - Lv5 bones of Lv7 Metafel Rerdan’s troops. Drawing out intersecting information and absorbing whole memories.]\nNice. He succeeded, just like he thought he would! In an instant, he analyzed the overwhelming information that flowed through his brain.\nThe instant he used Bone Reinforcement, a message appeared, confirming that they were indeed Metafel Rerdan’s troops.\nIn fact, they were a sort of reconnaissance unit. It seems as though Metafel had sent a few of these reconnaissance units to scout before they went deep into the mountain range. Their goal was definitely the Giants; they had come into this mountain range knowing that the Giants were here.\n’I need to see the memories before then. How Metafel’s troops got into the mountain range, and how they received their orders as well.’\nIf something went wrong, his undead seniors in the Giants’ domain would have to fight against one of the 12 generals, Metafel, before he even got a chance to do anything.\nHe ordered Rem to scout out a wider area, while he diligently analyzed the memories. Fortunately, by fusing together the memories of the level 5 Elite Knights, he found something that he could use.\n[General, it’s open. We’ve secured a road! The Archmage said that if we just go this way, we won’t get lost!]\n’A magical device! It’s definitely some sort of magical device!’\nIt was a circular gemstone that was so large that it looked as though it needed to be carried on a wagon.\nIt seemed a dozen times larger than a compass from Earth, but it didn’t simply point towards a direction; it analyzed the flow of mana that manipulated space and also possessed a magic that directed the owner to wherever they wished to go.\nIt was at least a level 6 artifact... That specialty, it had to be related to the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin, somehow!\n’I’ve gotten over the biggest hurdle for now. Which is the chance that Feotane Von Seldin is moving personally!’\nLee Shin Woo recollected Feotane Von Seldin’s might and suddenly began to shake. Of course, Lee Shin Woo had grown since then, and both his level and stats had grown as well. He’d also found a way to resist spatial magic on top of that.\nBut even so, he knew that he would be no match for him. He was way out of Lee Shin Woo’s league. If Feotane Von Seldin was personally involved, then Lee Shin Woo would immediately run away.\n[The forgotten Giants’ domain... Keuk, that sounds nice. I’ve been curious about this place since a while back. This time... Very good.]\nWas it really a coincidence that Metafel had only now found the Giants’ domain? Lee Shin Woo didn’t think so.\nIt could be connected to Lee Shin Woo and his party overcoming the training facility, or perhaps it was the movements of another hero... Especially someone like Ethan Cruz. The clouds of war that his seniors had seen were likely when the Empire made movements like this.\n[General, what are you going to do? We’ve been ordered to take everything hidden inside, but...]\n[Why do you think his Imperial Majesty sent me here in person? It’s because he’s aware of all this. That I become stronger the more I eat...]\nThe Mercenary King, Metafel was a Ghoul. The more corpses he ate, the faster his body would strengthen and recover, and when he ate the corpse of a powerful individual, then his growth would be unbelievable. Lee Shin Woo looked through the memories and had a rough idea as to what Metafel had planned.\n[We’ll do exactly as he wishes. Obviously, we have to present the frozen Titan’s Heart to his Majesty, but everything else is mine. With that, I’ll be sure to reach it... Level 8...!]\n[Is it true that we may be going to war...? I will always follow you General, no matter what!]\nThe frozen Titan’s Heart. He’d sure gotten some great information out of this... The more he followed the Giant’s back, the harsher the wind got, and he secretly smiled. He’d come to a great place at a great time. But at this rate, he’d need to prepare some things...\n\"Shino Rendu.\"\n[Yes, did you call for me?]\nLee Shin Woo communicated with Shino Rendu telepathically, even though he was so far away. Nowadays, he had become quite comfortable handling the darkness element, so this wasn’t an issue for him at all.\n\"It seems like the day of your vengeance will come sooner than you expected.\"\n[Huh...!?]\nShino Rendu reacted quite dramatically. It felt like he could tell what Shino Rendu’s expression was just based on his voice. Lee Shin Woo chuckled and spoke.\n\"I’ll let you kill Metafel personally. But the region’s really cold, so will you be ok?\"\n[I possess High Rank Ice Resistance. For the rest... I’ll be able to do it so long as I don’t give up.]\n\"Good. Then I’ll send you some Pauls with Ice Resistance, so come to where I tell you. It’s a bit difficult to enter the area, but... Well, I’ll get you a magical device that’ll help you get in soon.\"\n[I understand! ...Thank you very much!]\nOnce Lee Shin Woo was done conversing with Shino Rendu, he gave out detailed instructions to the Pauls. At the same time, he connected the Chi Pauls and Bisher Moon. All of Paul Zero’s elite troops (who were currently in the level 4 danger zone) would be coming! ...Of course, the last person he needed to talk to was Kratia.\n\"Shin Woo, you’re not...\"\n\"Of course I am.\"\nNow that Ethan Cruz was running around looking for one of the 12 generals to kill (of course, that’s just his excuse), this mountain range, which only a small handful of the Empire knows about and were assembled in...\n\"I’m taking the Titan’s Heart, and killing one of the 12 generals too.\"\n\"Jeez...\"\nLee Shin Woo declared firmly and Jin, who knew that this was how he would act, just sighed. At that moment, the Giant entered a hole within the crevice of the cliff. Lee Shin Woo and Jin likewise entered.\nAfter they entered, the crack within the severed space was restored and a new subspace was revealed. It was a vast, icy plain. The source of thɪs content is novel•fire.net\n[Welcome to the Giants’ village... Perlin Elta.]\nThe Giant who’d led them there spoke in a voice as though he had regained some of his intelligence. However, Lee Shin Woo didn’t get the chance to reply.\n[Who... is this!?]\n[He’s not a Giant. How did he get in here!?]\nBecause dozens, no hundreds of undead giants were looking at him.\n[1] T/N: Shield and seal sound similar in Korean.",

    "content": "<Chapter 31. Giants’ Domain - 4>\n\"My name is Paul Zero. I hold the Titan’s Pride.\"\nThis was the important part. Lee Shin Woo saw the Giants coming towards him from here and there and replied in an unwavering voice, but he was honestly a bit uneasy.\nThere were level 5 and 6 giants, and even a level 7 giant in the middle of them (they were all similarly named ’Sealed Titan Zombie’), though there weren’t any elites. Even so, they possessed an overwhelming amount of magic and health.\n’If they become hostile, will I be able to subdue them without killing them?’\nLee Shin Woo could roughly assess his abilities now, so he knew that they wouldn’t be able to kill him. However, it was difficult to hold back, and there were indeed some powerful Giants amongst them. He didn’t want to kill the Giants. At least, not yet.\n[I don’t feel... any traces of a Giant... within that body.]\n[Is a human... mocking us...?]\nThe Giants that had retained their intellect stepped forward and growled. Though their flesh had rotted away, their pride was still intact. They weren’t planning on forgiving someone who so carelessly threw out the word, ’Titan’. Despite their strength, Lee Shin Woo didn’t retreat.\n\"Does it really matter if I’m a Giant or not? What is important is that I have the Titan’s Pride.\"\n[The possessors of the Titan’s Pride... are all Giants!]\n[But you... are no Giant.]\nDespite his knowledge of the Titans and Giants, he was no Giant. This was what Jin had feared, as he’d said before, ’What the hell is this guy thinking?’.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo stayed firm. He knew how to get out of this situation, but it involved him (the wrongdoer) blaming others for his own wrongdoing.\n\"Haha, what a sad state you’re in. You’ve lost all of your power. Can you really call yourselves Giants looking like that?\"\n[Keuk!?]\n[This guy!]\nAs expected, Lee Shin Woo was the type to talk more when he needed to ’fight fire with fire’ than if the mood was peaceful and relaxed!\nLee Shin Woo frantically sifted through the Giant, Fennos’ memories, picked out words he could say that would mentally hurt them (as they had lost both their strength and their very lives) and yelled out as loud as he could.\n\"I’m saying that I’m much better than you guys, as I have not forgotten about the Titan’s Pride, and have continued to pursue that dream, while you guys have forgotten that very pride and have degenerated into such lifeless beings! Indeed, I have inherited Fennos’ will!\"\n[Fennos... Fennos!?]\n[How can that be...?]\nThat’s right. He’d activated the Acting and Instigate skills simultaneously, and had swayed them!\nTo be honest, he’d run out of things to say regarding the Giants (as his knowledge had bottomed out), so if he asked them about their fundamental issue, then they would be like ’We’ll let you off the hook for now, since we have to think about your question right now’. His plan had to work, but if it did, then he’d have to use various tricks to sway them again, so he really didn’t want to.\n[Fennos’ will? How?]\nBut fortunately for Lee Shin Woo, they focused on what he’d said. As he thought, Fennos was indeed the Giant who was closest to becoming a Titan.\n\"Hoo.\"\nAlthough Lee Shin Woo had merely absorbed Fennos’ bone, and never actually conversed with the living Fennos, he was extremely calm. Since he’d gotten this far, he was pretty much already at the finish line.\nThere was no need for him to drag the Giants onto his stage. Sitting in the seats was enough. They would witness his act, as the main character of his own monodrama!\n\"I first met him...\"\nLee Shin Woo used Fennos’ memories of him separating himself from the Giants, acting independently and alone, as well as the fragmented memories after his death to fuel his solo act.\nHe began to tell the magnificent story of a Giant who searched for their pride and a wandering human who’d lost their meaning to live, and how they met.\n\"And that’s how he left me with the Titan’s pride and went to his eternal sleep...\"\n[Kuheuk...!]\n[Fennos...!]\nLee Shin Woo told his story for 45 minutes, and when he was done, most of the level 5 Giants treated him like he was their brother.\nBecause they possessed zombie bodies, they couldn’t cry, but their bodies shook as though they were grieving, which made them not look like heartless undead. Jin watched on and was shocked like always.\n[You’re... our friend!]\n[You... helped me before! We’re... comrades!]\n[Comrade! Your heart is that of a Giant!]\nThe level 5 Giants couldn’t really speak properly and their thoughts were fragmented, but because Lee Shin Woo had spoken highly of Fennos, they considered him a close friend. Whereas the level 6 Giants, who were capable of rational thought...\n[I thought Fennos would never recognize a human, but... after hearing your story... I understand.]\n[I see. You’ve come to give us back our pride... which we’ve lost...!]\n[It’s irrefutable... We’re pitiful. Perhaps we’d even... forgotten the word... Giant.]\nThought of him as a trustworthy human. Perhaps they had known that something was wrong with their exhausted bodies following their deterioration. Though they looked at him with rough expressions, they nonetheless looked at Lee Shin Woo positively, which likely stemmed from him awakening them.\nHowever, this effect was a bit different with the three remaining level 7 Sealed Titan Zombies.\n[There’s no way Fennos would acknowledge a human.]\n[It’s a lie. I can’t believe that Fennos would entrust you with his will.]\n[In any case, it’s a lie. It’s definitely a lie.]\nThose three retained their intellect and their pride as ’Giants’. They led the Giants and didn’t accept him, so the other Giants became half-hearted as well.\n[I cannot allow you to come in.]\n[However...]\n[He’s our... friend!]\n[Even so, he cannot enter.]\nLee Shin Woo smiled bitterly at the sight and didn’t attempt to convince them any further. If he couldn’t convince them, even with this extensive use of Instigate, then increasing the intensity of the skill might cause a civil war. That wasn’t what Lee Shin Woo wanted.\n\"What exactly are you misunderstanding here? Giants, I am not trying to enter Perlin Elta. I’ve just come to give back what you have lost!\"\n[Keum...!]\nIt was a lie. Lee Shin Woo was sure that the Titan’s Heart lay within the deepest part of Perlin Elta, and he wanted to get his hands on it no matter what. He could even guess as to where it was as well.\nHe’d figured it out only after he’d enter the Giants’ domain, but the two undead heroes (who were Giants)... were in the same place as if they were overlapping. They must be protecting the Titan’s Heart.\n’If things go awry and I have to kill all of the Giants, then I have to steal the Titan’s Heart before one of the 12 generals can get to it. However...’\nThat scenario was much too plain. He’d finally met a tribe that possessed a completely different power, yet they would only become a single meal for him if he were to implement this plan. It wasn’t what he was looking for.\nFortunately, he had a way to break through this stalemate. He’d already laid the bait. Now they just needed to take it.\n\"There’s something I have to tell you. You guys are in danger... There’s a chance that you won’t be able to regain the Titan’s Pride and that the entire tribe may be annihilated!\"\n[What... did you say...!?]\nLee Shin Woo inwardly smiled. That’s right. Ironically, the Imperial Army which had discomforted him was helping him now.\n\"The Imperial Army has entered the mountain range. Feotane Von Seldin has broken through the blessing of mana that protects us. The Emperor of the Heita Empire is aiming for the Titan’s Heart!\"\n[What...!]\n[How did they learn about the Titan’s Heart!?]\nThe moment the words ’Titan’s Heart’ were spoken, almost all of the Giants responded. One of the giants was shocked and its rotten eyes widened, while another tightened its fist; one of them even attacked Lee Shin Woo!\n[Aren’t you part of the Imperial Army!?]\n\"Heup.\"\nOne of the level 7 Giants attempted to punch Lee Shin Woo, but he stretched out his hand and blocked it.\nSo long as he had Rule of Bone, his strength and health could be reinforced exponentially, and if that overwhelming mana was focused in one place... Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on novel•ﬁre.net\n[Ku...ot...!?]\nEven though it was a level 7 Giant, which was over 10 meters tall, Lee Shin Woo could briefly grab its arm and lift it! It was a mere performance that had no actual use on the battlefield, as its mana consumption was extremely high, but that performance was paramount right now.\n\"Has your mind rotted away along with your pride?\"\n[Kuhahk!?]\nLee Shin Woo said coldly and flung the Giant. Not only had it lost in a bout of strength against a human, but it had also been thrown with just one arm, so it was quite humiliating for the Giant.\nIt was so overwhelming that the other Giants were overwhelmed as well, as they watched along vacantly.\n\"If you were to just listen to the Giant I rescued, you would’ve known. And if you can’t trust what I told him, then you can just go out there and see for yourselves! Moreover, if I were part of the Imperial Army, then do you really think I would come to discuss the Titan’s Heart with you!?\"\n[Kuaah...]\nThe Giants couldn’t forget what was said, as they were both humiliated and frustrated. Then, the Giant who had led Lee Shin Woo to the village spoke up.\n[I was attacked... by the Imperial Army. They... were surprised once they saw Paul Zero! They’re enemies!]\n[Is that... true?]\n[Are you not... planning on lying... and using us?]\n[He killed... the Empire’s troops! He left none... alive!]\nLee Shin Woo deliberately didn’t add anything. He believed interfering with their discussion wouldn’t be a good idea. As he thought, they listened more intently to one of their comrades, and suddenly, one of the level 7 Giants spoke.\n[I’ll need to check.]\n[I’m still not sure about him.]\n[We cannot let him enter.]\n[If he really came here to help us, then...]\n[We should be able to verify if that’s the truth or not.]\nWith that, the Giants finally agreed. The two level 7 Giants helped the final level 7 Giant up, whose head was buried in the ground, and convinced it. Even though it looked enraged, it soon nodded its head and spoke.\n[We cannot let the Imperial Army take the Titan’s Heart.]\n[We, the giants, are the ones who succeed the Titan’s Pride. Though our bodies have rotten, the Titan’s blood still flows through our veins.]\n[If that’s the case, then... we cannot afford to be wasting time like this.]\nThe three gazed at Lee Shin Woo. The other level 5 and level 6 Giants did the same.\n[Paul Zero, you’ll have to verify your own ’Titan’s Pride’.]\n[We’ll observe, and make a decision afterwards.]\nLee Shin Woo’s jawbone clattered as he smiled. Since he really had no reason to hide his feelings from them.\n\"Alright. I’ll show you my pride. No, that shouldn’t be all.\"\nHe was sure that the Giants had stepped onto his stage and smiled. He then declared.\n\"We’ll all have to prove our pride on the battlefield against the Imperial Army.\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 31. Giants’ Domain - 5>\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t an idiot. He had no intention of leading the weakened undead giants in the fight against one of the 12 generals. That’s one of the reasons Lee Shin Woo had sent for his elites.\nBut there was something he had to do beforehand: helping these elites pass through the spatial wall (which was naturally formed by the flow of mana) that blocked them from entering the Giants’ domain.\n\"There’s a way to solve that issue while screwing over the Imperial Army.\"\n\"Stealing the magical device they brought into the mountain range, right?\"\n\"Yeah, exactly.\"\nLee Shin Woo shared Rem’s vision, who was watching the movements of Metafel’s troops from midair, and replied as he surveyed every nook and cranny of the land.\nThat’s right. There was a way to screw over Metafel’s troops, as well as getting his own troops into the vast area without getting lost.\nIt involved stealing the artifact that Lee Shin Woo assumed the Archmage created. He had formulated this idea when he’d went through the enemy troops’ memories.\n[We’ll be the ones who strike first... I like it.]\nThen, those participating in the battle spoke. Lee Shin Woo snorted and replied.\n\"Ha, of course. We were attacked. You’re not planning on waiting until they’re at our very doorstep, are you?\"\n[Of course not!]\nLee Shin Woo said provokingly, and a Giant... the level 7 Sealed Titan Zombie hit the roof as if saying ’are you kidding me?’. He was so powerful that Lee Shin Woo wondered why he wasn’t an elite.\n’If I put in a bit of effort, then I think I can turn them into elites like the Pauls... I’ve been a bit worried about the ’sealed’ part of their names. There’s something hidden within them. I don’t know if it’s something they’ve lost or forgotten, but I’ll need to put them through various stimuli to find out.’\nThat was one of the reasons he was bringing a level 7 onto the battlefield, but... he looked back at the two other level 7 Giants standing side by side (from behind the third level 7 Giant) and shook his head.\nAlthough they had regained their intellect, it seemed as though they were fundamentally quite stupid, as they suggested a frontal attack when Lee Shin Woo had suggested that they attack the Imperial Army.\n\"As I said, we’re not going for a frontal attack. We’ll attack while they’re still careless, and we’ll leave once we get what we want. You have to run away when I say so. That’s the way we can win against them.\"\n[Giants do not retreat!]\n[Your words dirty the Titan’s Pride!]\nYeah, he knew this would happen. The success of this entire operation relied upon how well he could convince them. Lee Shin Woo sighed and said.\n\"Sure, feel free to do that if you’d like to exchange your entire tribe’s fate for a moment’s pride, but you’ll lose.\"\n[Keuk!?]\n\"You won’t even get the opportunity to prove your Titan’s Pride, and you’ll even lose the Titan’s Heart to them. They will leave, mocking you, the once brave Giants.\"\n[Are you looking down on our, the Giants’ will!?]\n\"You’re the ones looking down on the Giants’ will. If you want to win, follow my orders.\"\nLee Shin Woo activated his High Rank Command skill. He himself wasn’t aware of this, but when the Command skill had reached the high rank level, he became able to show his dignity and strength to those who aren’t even his subordinates.\nTherefore, they couldn’t take him lightly, and they instinctually felt daunted by him. It was no different from forcefully engraving his dignified appearance straight into their minds.\n[Keuk, I guess we have no choice...]\n[I’ll respect your decision this time.]\n\"Yeah, thanks a lot,\" Lee Shin Woo replied and his goblin fire subsided. He’d already told them this before. Whenever Lee Shin Woo convinced these damn, rotten idiots, they would look like they were convinced, but then ten minutes later, they’d forget what he’d told them!\n[Master, the enemy is moving.]\n\"Alright. Although, they’re moving extremely slowly...\"\nThe enemy’s compass not only released the mana’s interference on space but also taught them where their ultimate destination... the frozen Titan’s Heart was.\nThe mountains were dangerous, so they were going around in circles, but they would eventually enter the Giants’ domain.\n\"We’re going too. We can’t just let them do as they please.\"\n[Got it.]\nNow that the level 7 Giants would listen to him, albeit for a brief period of time, they and the rest of the Giants followed him swiftly. Perhaps because they were the original inhabitants of these mountains, they were extremely fast, even though they were now zombies. It was quite fortunate for him.\n\"Rem, keep reporting on the enemy’s movements.\"\n[I understand.]\nAfter a few hours of surveillance, Lee Shin Woo knew how large Metafel’s army was, their location, as well as their level distribution.\nAnd until he’d acquired all this information, Lee Shin Woo had been looking down on Metafel. That’s because Lee Shin Woo had destroyed the Metafel’s corps, which had been led by the level 6 Corps Commander, Vitas in the past. Moreover, Metafel was only level 7 himself!\n’SSeup, it’ll be hard.’\nHowever, Metafel wasn’t an opponent he could take lightly. Although he’d only seen him through Rem’s eyes, Metafel was frighteningly strong, and even though they were both level 7s, he was sure that Metafel was much stronger.\nMoreover, there was a level 7 elite among his direct subordinates, as well as two level 7 elite Corps Commanders leading his troops. In other words, he was facing one highest rank level 7 elite as well as three mid rank level 7 elites!\n’And there are all sorts of undead exceeding level 6, especially the magic division. There’s also the level 4 or 5 knights that command the elite level 3 troops...’\nThe size of that force was 50,000 strong. It was such a considerable amount of troops that one would naturally say ’as expected of the Mercenary King’. Lee Shin Woo marveled at the fact that Shino Rendu had actually gotten past this and had made his way all the way to Metafel himself.\n\"Metafel’s troops are currently exploring the mountain range, and are divided into dozens of groups.\"\n\"He split his troops because the land wasn’t suitable for moving a large number of troops, right?\"\n\"Yep.\"\nTo be honest, there weren’t that many vast open plains in the mountains, like the one he’d saved the Giant in. Most of the roads were dangerous and narrow, so it was difficult for even two horses to walk through. If that weren’t the case, then Lee Shin Woo might have had to capitulate earlier.\nThen how did the Giants move around through the mountain range? The question was pretty meaningless, as wherever they set foot became a road. Even the lowest level Giants were several meters tall, and with that overwhelming mass and their stats, they could make even the most dangerous roads into safe ones.\n\"Good. It’s going just as I’d planned. They’re exactly where I want them.\"\nMetafel’s troops were divided in a way so that hundreds could move at a time. Of course, Metafel himself was in the center of his troops, but it was impossible for him to systematically respond to every single issue nearby.\n\"Then, shall we find the right route?\"\n[Alright.]\n[A true Giant needs no plan... No, I got it. Damn!]\n\"We just need to worry about a few of the corps. If they approach from here and come out like this, then... We just need to fight this guy, this guy, and this guy.\"\nThough they were now rotten Giants, there were some things they knew that were helpful to Lee Shin Woo. A side road to the forest, a route that was easy to travel on, as well as where the giant boulders lay, which would make it difficult for others to move through the road!\nIf he added all that into his minimap, then he would have an effective topographic map. And if he were to add in the info that Rem had acquired, then it was a piece of cake to make an operation consisting of infiltrating and exiting.\nThey would break through the weakest and lax corps, and acquire a way to approach and a way to retreat. When the two level 7 elite Corps Commanders were confused and diverting their attention, Lee Shin Woo would steal the artifact and escape! That was Lee Shin Woo’s primary objective.\n\"We’ll kill the first ones that we come across. You don’t need to kill all of them. You just need to kill their leader.\"\n[So you want to kill their commander.]\n\"And before that chaos spreads elsewhere, then we’ll strike the main force’s... leader. After we kill him, then we’ll come down and regroup.\"\n[You want me to procure an escape route.]\n\"That’s most important.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s black goblin fire gazed into the Giant’s rotten eyes as if penetrating through them. Nothing else needed to be said. The Giant nodded its head.\n[I’ve already told you that I’d cooperate with you in order to protect the Titan’s Pride.]\n[But if the result displeases us, despite us following your orders, then you’ll have to repay that debt.]\n\"Of course, do as you please.\"\nLee Shin Woo snorted and replied. He would act however he could if it meant that he could suppress their pride and make them follow his orders.\n\"Alright. We’ll split up here. Move!\"\n[Don’t betray our expectations!]\n[That ’pride’ you spoke of. Make sure you prove it!]\nLee Shin Woo had used a liberal amount of mana to active the Command skill, mixed with the Instigate skill, and after the two Giants responded trustworthily, they divided into two groups and left.\nOne of the two groups would find the road to approach while the other would find a retreat route. If those two killed the weaklings and flustered Metafel, then Lee Shin Woo would seize that opportunity fair and square and take the artifact away from them!\n\"Jin... I’m counting on you.\"\n\"You only act serious at times like this.\"\n\"Let’s go.\"\n\"...Humph!\"\nJin replied curtly, yet couldn’t hide his contentedness as he kicked off the dangerous mountain road and began to run. Jin loved this moment the most; when Lee Shin Woo trusted in Jin and entrusted his body to him. Because this was the moment that Jin could prove his worth through the running he was so proud of!\n[Kuhahk!?]\n[Giants!]\n[I heard that the Giants had all weakened... Kuaaaaaahk!]\nWhile charging, Lee Shin Woo saw one of the low rank level 6 elites get torn apart. As expected, there was no way they were normal level 7s. Even if he were to strip away 99% of what they (the ones who inherited the Titan’s Pride) said as lies, the Giant Tribe was still amazing!\n[Kuhaaaaaaaaaaah! The Titan’s... Pride!]\n\"Make sure you prove that remaining 1%!\"\nLee Shin Woo shared his thoughts with Jin, and Jin ran quickly. Due to the sudden appearance of the Giants, the troops were shocked and broke rank. Lee Shin Woo passed by them, and boldly pierced through the side of the slowly moving troop that was protecting both the compass and Metafel. Google seaʀᴄh novｅlfire.net\n[Hmm? To think that there would be one so foolish as to face our troops head-on in such a short period of time... Wait a sec, this is a glacial mountain range, so how can such a small undead be here? No, what is all this fuss about anyway? All forces, calm down! Calm down and face the enemy! There’s only one enemy!]\nMetafel quickly noticed Lee Shin Woo’s intrusion and narrowed his eyes, but in any case, his first priority was to strike down the one who looked down on his troops and picked a fight with them.\nHe angrily scolded his troops, which were in a state of panic. He possessed the highest level of Command amongst all the 12 generals, at the high rank! Even amidst Lee Shin Woo’s limitless speed, the undead troops got a hold of themselves and attempted to surround him. However...\n\"You idiots. Protect Sir Metafeeeeeeeeeeel!\"\n[What the hell is he talking about!?]\nHe was one step ahead of Metafel!\n[A perfect Instigate! You took advantage of the opportunity and used Instigate to mislead your enemies! The Instigate skill has become Lv7. Magic has increased by 20.]\n[The enemy troops are under the effect of Lv7 High Rank Command. You will not be able to fool them for very long. If there is something you want, then you must steal it immediately!]\nOnce Lee Shin Woo, who’d suddenly intruded, said something so absurd, Metafel became completely flustered. Then, an even more disconcerting situation arose.\n[T-That’s right! Someone has trespassed, so we have to protect Sir Metafel!]\n[Sir Metafel is in danger!]\n[Sir Metafel... I will protect Sir Metafel!]\n[What are you guys doing!?]\nHis men, who had faithfully followed him since his mercenary days, suddenly surrounded Metafel to protect him! Metafel was taken aback and browbeat them to get a hold of themselves, but the energy of the Instigate skill that surrounded them wouldn’t be so easily dispelled.\n[Get a hold of yourselves, you idiots!]\nWhenever he gave an order, Metafel used the high rank skill, Lion’s Roar, and forced his subordinates to calm down. As expected of the Mercenary King to have such a skill, as he was so adept at leading...\n[What...?]\nBy the time Metafel had managed to calm his troops down, push them back, and barely regain his vision, the wagon that his troops had been guarding so carefully... to be exact, the magical device within it had already vanished without a trace.",

    "content": "<Chapter 31. Giants’ Domain - 6>\nLee Shin Woo had forced his way through Metafel’s troops, and once he’d broken the wagon, he realized that the Archmage had set up some security measures on the compass.\nWell, it makes sense. After all, who would just hand something this precious out for free? There were dozens of security spells set up, and the other spells made it difficult for him to even analyze the magical device. ...However, he was used to it.\n\"Rem!\"\n[I’m coming!]\nLee Shin Woo called Rem, and at the same time, placed his hand on the compass and forcefully released his darkness magic.\nHe’d managed to steal a level 8 artifact from the Archmage before, an artifact that he had personally looked after. Whereas, this magical device’s performance had been so limited that it was only a level 6 artifact. If he couldn’t do as he pleased with this item, then it would be an embarrassment to the Joker name.\n\"Nice. It’s just like I’d learned from Kratia...! Hacking’s pretty easy.\"\n\"When did you learn that!?\"\n[I’ve arrived, Master!]\n\"Good. I’ll leave it to you.\"\nLee Shin Woo saw Rem’s magic completely enclose around the giant compass and knew that the first step was complete.\nThat first step was to release the location tracking function (the artifact possessed a few tracking functions, but it was multi-layered, so it was really a pain in the ass) and transfer ownership of the item to him.\n\"We’re done with the first step, so let’s move on to the next! Leave the rest to Kratia!\"\n[I understand!]\n[You morons, get a hold of yourselves!]\nRight when Lee Shin Woo had acquired the compass and placed it into his inventory, he heard Metafel, who had once been completely surrounded by his men, yell, as if browbeating them.\nUpon hearing that, Lee Shin Woo immediately felt the surrounding undeads’ rotten eyes begin to brighten, which meant that Metafel possessed a skill that acted in the reverse of Instigate: a skill that cleared their minds.\n[Ugh... How did the trespasser get in!?]\n\"Hoo... Let’s go!\"\nRem, who’d finished its mission, flew into the sky once more, and began relaying information on Lee Shin Woo’s surroundings to him. After Lee Shin Woo had confirmed that the Giant, who’d secured an approach route for him had safely gotten to the retreat route, he likewise retreated.\n[You cannot take that!]\nHowever, there was someone tailing him. It was none other than the level 7 elite that usually stuck by Metafel’s side and protected him.\nIt was a knight who could use both swords and bows, but as soon as it saw Lee Shin Woo running away with the magical device, it raised its bow, drew the bowstring, and began firing arrows at him!\n\"What a pain!\"\n[Keuk!?]\nLee Shin Woo didn’t have time to face it head on, so he shot out a Breath of the Lightning God and exploded it in order to buy time. But then, Metafel threw a giant axe at him, as he was able to move again.\n[How dare you take our corps’ treasure!]\n\"Heup!\"\nThere was no way Jin, who possessed agility that far outstripped even most level 7s, wouldn’t have some sort of evasion skill. With his shocking reflexes, Jin managed to dodge the axe, and leapt up into the air. He’d changed his back feet into springs, gaining an overwhelming jumping and charging ability!\n\"T-The horse is...\"\n\"The horse is flying in the sky!\"\nThey briefly jumped over the heads of hundreds of undead, and then got to the escape route. There, the most formidable Giants were ripping apart the undead.\n\"Let’s go back now!\"\n[Kuhaaaaah! Have you shown your pride!?]\n\"I’ll tell you all about it when we get back, so make way!\"\nThese damn Giants were looking for his ’pride’ every 5 minutes! In any case, they’d secured their retreat, which was such a relief.\nHe attempted to drag the Giants with him and retreat. The plan was to return home safely from their excursion!\n[How dare you look down upon General Metafel! I won’t stop until I kill you all!]\n[Kuhahk!?]\nBut when he though they were finally listening to him and following him, one of countless arrows flying towards them (they were shot by the level 7 elite, so it should’ve hurt quite a bit) hit a Giant’s forearm; the Giant’s eyebrows twitched and it turned around.\n[Before we retreat, I have to pay him back in kind for this injury!]\n\"Like I was saying, I told you not to do that, you idiot!\"\n[Are you going to run away like a coward!? How can you even call yourself a Giant!?]\nWhy did they have to provoke it now!? The arrow-firing level 7 elite was trying to buy time until Metafel could return to the front, but it turned out to be super effective against the Giants.\n[Giants do not retreat... Kuhahk!]\n\"We’ll be going now! But next time, it won’t be this easy!\"\n[Y-You bastards! All you did was trick my troops from start to finish, so what do you have up your sleeve now!?]\nThe magic words, which would allow them to safely retreat from any situation, was on the tip of his tongue, and the Lee Shin Woo pulled on the Giant’s arm and ran (the Giant had opened up the retreat path, yet it was primed to charge into enemy lines).\nThough his entire body’s mana was used to strengthen one arm, it couldn’t hope to compare to the size of a Giant’s arm; dragging its arm and running atop a horse was quite the sight.\n[T-The Titan’s Pride...!]\n\"It’s too heavy! I can’t run like this!\"\n\"You hear? Apparently, you’re really heavy. So... umph!\"\nLee Shin Woo lifted the Giant with a single arm, and forcefully threw it. The level 7 Giants, who had safely retreated ahead of them, caught the Giant.\n[How dare you!?]\nOf course, the Giant was really pissed, and wanted to argue with him, but Lee Shin Woo wasn’t one to be taken lightly.\n\"I just saved your lives. How many times do I have to tell you that we had to retreat to win!? You idiots. How can you claim to be descendants of the Titans!? Do you really think that you can become a Titan with just those rotten muscles of yours!?\"\n[Keuk, I-I got it. Sorry...]\nThe Giants, who had briefly experienced Lee Shin Woo’s rage, shrank, despite their levels. Lee Shin Woo clicked his tongue when he looked back to see the undead chasing behind them, especially Metafel and the level 7 elites at the front.\n\"If you’re sorry, then run! Just keep running until we reach the place we talked about!\"\nWas the operation over with them breaking through enemy lines and acquiring the artifact? Obviously not. They had just stolen the artifact from the enemy forces right under their noses, so they wouldn’t just sit on their asses and do nothing!\nFrom the very beginning, Metafel’s pursuit had been expected. No matter how well the plan progressed they couldn’t avoid pursuit. ...Because of that, Lee Shin Woo had set a trap beforehand with the help of the level 5 and level 6 Giants.\nRegardless of how low their levels were, it didn’t change the fact that the Giants possessed large enough bodies and power to change the mountainous land!\n\"Get past it! Jump over it!\"\n[Huaaaah!]\nThere was a huge break in the middle of the path. Of course, an opening a dozen meters wide was nothing for the level 7 Giants, and Jin was able to jump over it without even using his springs.\n\"Run forward. Run even faster!\"\n[Keuk. Us Giants are...]\n[F-For the Titan!]\nThese Giants made Lee Shin Woo’s life hell today; whenever their pride was damaged, they would habitually mutter ’Titan’.\nIf they had to memorize that one word in order to overcome danger, then he’d listen to it as much as they wanted! Lee Shin Woo checked to see the Giants were past the cliff and then checked behind him as well.\n[Ha, is that all?]\n[General, we’ll join up with you immediately!]\n[You guys sure gave us some trouble...]\nSeveral hundred meters could be crossed within 0.01 seconds with a level 7’s strength, and Metafel and the other two level 7 elites (one of the Corps Commanders had, at some point, joined up with them) were watching him.\n[Did you think you could stop us from following us just by using this cliff? I wondered what kind of man you were to have caused so much chaos amongst my troops and stolen the magical device, but this was all you amounted to?]\n\"If you’re really that confident, then why don’t you just come on over?\"\nLee Shin Woo stood on the other side of the cliff without moving an inch. As if he had resolved himself to fight against them head on! However, Metafel didn’t attack in haste, and asked him some questions first. His bandit-like, rough face was etched with rage.\n[Whose orders are you following? How did you get those Giants to act? And how did you know that we had a magical device.]\n\"Ha...\"\nLee Shin Woo laughed wickedly, as if he were waiting for him to ask that very question. That’s right. Most of the time, this is how it would go. The 12 generals had too much pride to think that Lee Shin Woo had done this all on his own!\nAnd if he managed to divert some of Metafel’s hostility to another party, then he was prepared to say anything!\n\"Who else? You can’t even figure that out by yourself?\"\n[Ugh... It must be... that bastard, Seagald...!]\nLee Shin Woo hadn’t even said anything, but Metafel opened his eyes wide and yelled furiously. At that moment, his feet shook. Lee Shin Woo’s side wasn’t shaking at all, but the side that Metafel was standing did.\n[You..!?]\nMetafel realized that Lee Shin Woo had done something, and leapt up from the cliff towards Lee Shin Woo, but before he could get to him, five giant shields blocked his path. Metafel’s helmet and the shields crashed against each other.\n[Kuhahk!?]\nThe five thick and durable shields blocked Metafel’s advance, as well as his and his subordinates’ vision. ’A-Another trick!’ Metafel thought. Metafel stuck to the shields and swung his axe in anger. With just a single blow, the shields cracked.\n[Kuaaaaaaah!]\n’There’s no way you can get away from me! I’ll just break through this damn wall and follow you...!’, he thought, but at that moment the five shields blew up simultaneously.\n[Kahat!?]\nMetafel was the one who’d been hit by the explosion, yet the ones screaming were the two level 7 elites that followed him. The narrow hill that had been shaking began to crumble due to the pressure of the explosion!\n[Kuaahk!]\n[General, please hold on! The entire cliff is collapsing...!]\nThere was no way he’d be hurt by this explosion or this earthquake, but he also couldn’t fly in the air, as he didn’t have a foothold any longer.\nMetafel, his elites, as well as his soldiers that had hastily followed him in their pursuit of Lee Shin Woo fell. Of course, this was all because of the Giants’ work.\n[Keuk, how disgraceful...!]\n[General, are you alright!?]\n[W-Where is he!?]\nDespite him falling several kilometers down, Metafel’s level 7 elites were unharmed. Of course, there were a few elites that had died, but they were just consumables that could be replenished at any time.\n[General, I can’t find him...!]\n[Did you lose him!?]\n[I-I’m so sorry!]\nIt would be impossible for them to find Lee Shin Woo again, as they had lost time from the explosion and had dropped several kilometers below the cliff.\nMoreover, they had fallen between the cold, icy cliffs and were stuck, so no matter how high they raised their heads, they couldn’t even begin to figure out which direction the Giants and Lee Shin Woo had run off in.\n[In a single instant... it’s definitely an organized movement. Anti-Skull... to think those damn bastards and the Giants were allied together! Perhaps even the frozen Titan’s Heart...!]\n[You don’t need to worry so much, General.]\nHowever, his loyal soldier, Setoin Miletus, who could always get through any adversity with his archery and was always by his side, calmed him down. Setoin was the only one amongst Metafel’s troops that hadn’t been tricked by Lee Shin Woo’s Instigate skill and had tried to stop him.\n[There’s a tracking function on the magical device. The Archmage actually planned for this, and gave us a separate device that would allow us to track its location. Compared to the compass, which will point us in the right direction, this one will tell us their exact location!]\n[Ha... as expected of the Archmage. He makes it so I don’t have to feel embarrassed about my mistake!] Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn novèlfire.net\nOriginally, Metafel didn’t really feel anything for the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin, but he suddenly came to respect him. If they took the magical device with them, and returned to their original location, then they could use this opportunity to get them all in one fell swoop!\n[Alright. Then let’s go back. We’ll begin our pursuit immediately, right after we’ve re-organized the troops. Let’s show those careless bastards what it means to anger the Empire!]\n[I understand, General!]\nMetafel gritted his teeth, as he sensed the general direction that the Giants and Lee Shin Woo had run off in. Before he’d become one of the 12 generals, Metafel had fought in countless battles, but this would remain as one of his most humiliating experiences.\n[How dare he? How dare he screw me over like this... I’ll show you how much of a mistake it was to anger me, the Mercenary King...!]\nHe would kill them all: the one who had stolen the magical device from him, as well as those Giants! Using the magical device that the Archmage had given Setoin to track them!\n...And thus began the arduous journey for the 50,000 troops under Metafel’s command.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 31 part7",
    "content": "<Chapter 31. Giants’ Domain - 7>\nLee Shin Woo, who’d successfully stolen away the compass (the actual name was [Lv6 Mana Guide]) and gotten away from Metafel, told the Giants to get ready for their next mission. After that, they used a giant cave near their domain as their command center.\nBecause the outskirts of their domain was quite a ways away, it wasn’t suitable to use as a base of operations.\n\"Wow, it’s deep. Plus, this chill...\"\n\"It’ll be worse if you go outside.\"\nWhereas, this cave allowed the Giants to communicate whenever they pleased and was situated in a location that was difficult for the enemy to find. Therefore, Lee Shin Woo planned on gathering his subordinates here.\n\"It’s a really nice place.\"\n\"I thought you’d say something like that.\"\nTo be honest, there was another reason he hadn’t set up his command center directly inside of the Giants’ domain. It was because of Kratia.\nOf course, because of his influence, the undead under his command had long since overcome their instinct - their instinctual hatred of living beings. However, the Giants had merely acknowledged Lee Shin Woo; they hadn’t actually pledged their loyalty to him. There was no reason to provoke them by showing them Kratia.\n\"It’s been a long time, so what have you two been doing?\"\nLee Shin Woo had used his Bone Gate (ever since he realized that the Bone Gate evolves the more bones it eats, Lee Shin Woo hadn’t felt bad about feeding it bones) to bring Kratia to the cave, or their command center. Then Jin, who was forced to stay behind due to the Bone Gate’s max carrying capacity, spoke sullenly.\n\"You’ll be surprised. Can you tell? This blinding and brilliant bone compass...!\"\n\"...Is this what you were telling me about? Did you miniaturize it... Huh?\"\nLee Shin Woo, as if waiting for her to say that, extracted a few small compasses from his inventory.\nThey were very different from the original compass in size, but they looked so similar that one would believe it if Lee Shin Woo said that he’d miniaturized the original. Kratia analyzed them from the side.\n\"It turned into bone because Shin Woo touched it, but because of that, it became easier to analyze. The effect’s the same, but its range has lessened a bit, so it was divided into more than one. Despite splitting into six pieces, it’s still a level 6 artifact.\"\n\"That was possible...?\"\nOriginally, the Mana Guide was an artifact that could cover Metafel’s entire army. Kratia studied the artifact with Lee Shin Woo and split it into several pieces.\nOf course, it wasn’t easy, but her manufacturing ability, which had improved due to her study of Huginn’s Eye, combined with Lee Shin Woo’s magic, resulted in the Mana Guide’s new form.\n\"If you have this, you can resist the spatial magic.\"\n\"Anyway, I should give these to each of the Pauls’ leaders.\"\nHe’d give one to Kratia, keep one for himself, and the rest would go to Shino Rendu, Chi Paul, Bester Moon, and the group of golems. If the Archmage knew about this, then he’d hit the floor wailing. Why, you ask...?\n\"We didn’t completely remove the tracking function, so right about now, the enemy forces should be in chaos.\"\n\"It must feel like they’re looking for the scattered dragon balls...\"\nHe heard someone interrupting his satisfying monologue, so it had to be Jin.\n\"I know about Dragon Ball!\"\n\"I suppose there was a similar comic in your world too.\"\n\"Shin Woo, you won’t always be able to use that excuse to get away with things!\"\nLee Shin Woo did his best to ignore Jin’s hot gaze, and he passed a few of the compasses to Rem. He heard a report that his subordinates would arrive soon.\n\"Come back after you’ve passed them around. While you’re at it, find out where their main forces are.\"\n[I understand.]\nBy the time Lee Shin Woo was done seeing Rem off and had turned around, Kratia was already analyzing things all over the place. Then again, Kratia would be curious about the giant flow of mana that hid the mountain range, the overwhelming cold here, and the Giant Tribe, so it made sense.\n\"Kratia, I’ve already told you this before, but you can’t provoke the Giants.\"\n\"I’ll leave the Giants to you, Shin Woo. I’m interested in the cold.\"\n\"The cold is probably connected to the Giants too.\"\n\"Huh...?\"\nKratia tilted her head and soon began her study, but quickly realized that Lee Shin Woo was right.\n\"The center of the Giants’ domain is... the source of the cold.\"\n\"Metafel called it the frozen Titan’s Heart.\"\n\"You’re saying that a single item caused all this? ...Freezing the entire mountain range?\"\n\"Probably.\"\n\"Oooh...!\"\nKratia’s eyes shined. Her eyes were silently asking him for something! Of course, even if she looked at him like that, he couldn’t bring her the Titan’s Heart.\n\"Be patient for now. Plus, even if we do get it, it’s not yours.\"\n\"But it’s an artifact that really, really suits me! ...It really, really, really, suits me!\"\nKratia grabbed both of his hands. Lee Shin Woo thought of a way he could use the frozen Titan’s Heart, but... he had to throw out some bait. He acted as though he were smiling benevolently and said.\n\"I’ll give it to you then. I promise.\"\nKratia snorted and agreed to cooperate with the ’big picture’ for now; she decided to take control over the surrounding cold.\nAs she was able to use ice magic, the colder her surroundings got, the more powerful her magic became. It was the same as Lee Shin Woo’s lightning; in an area filled to the brim with lightning, his lightning would come out even stronger. Moreover, Kratia was able to use Catalyst Magic to influence her surroundings, so...\n\"It’s tremendous. Perhaps this area was a battlefield created for me alone.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"\n\"Heuuuup...!\"\nKratia ran across the snowy fields with her orb (which had gotten even smaller than before). He couldn’t help but laugh, as it was like watching a little kid, but wherever she went, the cold in the surrounding area would change bit by bit, which was a little scary.\nShe was attempting to put the entire area’s mana under her control. The fact that it was actually working was most shocking!\n\"...If we were to fight here, then Kratia might be our greatest asset.\"\n\"Even so, don’t get careless. ...Someone like her is rare.\"\n\"Of course. I got through that pandemonium too, remember.\"\nJin said, and Lee Shin Woo nodded his head. They’d managed to beat Metafel once, but if Lee Shin Woo’s ability had been lacking even a little bit, the plan would’ve failed. That just proved how great their opponent was. Read complete versıon only at novel⸺fire.net\n’Metafel’s Command skill is the worst fit for my Instigate skill. Even if I can trick his troops, I can’t do it for very long. No, it might not even work a second time.’\nMetafel, who he’d encountered not far from here, proved that he had earned his post, rather than just playing cards and getting in through luck, as he was indeed quite powerful. What was even more impressive than his power was his skill to command his troops! Lee Shin Woo’s Instigate skill, which shined the most when he was against an army, was sealed, which was, in several ways, a pain in the ass.\nMoreover, according to Shino Rendu, Metafel’s true strength lay in the Ghoul’s innate ability, but since he hadn’t used that ability yet...\n’Plus, his subordinates are no joke...’\nThere was an even bigger problem: the unexpected presence of powerful elites. Especially his guard, the level 7 elite, Setoin Miletus.\nMost archers he’d seen hadn’t been a high level like Setoin, and at the minimum, he possessed High Rank Archery, allowing him to attack from long range with such precision and ferocity. He’d managed to dodge his arrows because of Jin’s exception agility, but the level 7 Giant who’d been hit in the forearm was still complaining about its wound, despite its size.\n\"If you take all of that into account, it’s not something you can handle with just your wit.\"\n\"Yeah. That’s why I brought Kratia over. Moreover...\"\nLee Shin Woo had found Metafel’s location through Rem and nodded his head in satisfaction. He had split his troops into dozens of groups and they were wandering around the mountain range.\nIf a single, unified army was powerful, then all one needed to do was split it up! Even now, the moving corps didn’t realize that they were getting increasingly far from one another. Since their compass which blocked the mana interference was gone! Once they found a trace of Lee Shin Woo, they moved towards it; the more they moved towards that trace, the further they got from each other, isolating them!\n[Paul Zero, we’ve come.]\n[Paul Zero, we’ve come as well. We were found by heroes halfway through, so we had to take the long way, but...]\n[As per your instructions, Master, the golems are opening a path.]\n[Paul Zero, we’ve come to stomp on any insects who follow the Emperor’s command!]\nThen, as if planning this, his subordinates (who were at least level 6 elites) reported in. Lee Shin Woo planned out how they, Kratia, and the Giants would move, and grinned. He had this many forces, and perfect information as well. He didn’t think he’d lose at this point.\n\"Rem, hurry up.\"\n[I’ve found our comrades. I will now begin handing out the items.]\nThe level 7 Wolf Avenger, Bester Moon’s force consisted of 50 level 4 or higher Pauls.\nThe level 6 Undead Avenger, Shino Rendu’s force consisted of 50 Pauls as well.\nThe level 7 Chimera Avenger, Chi Paul’s force consisted of 31 level 6 Chi Pauls.\nAnd finally, the Emerald Corps consisted of 10 Silver Golems and 200 Dark Emerald Bone Golems!\nThey had all received a compass from Rem and had entered the mountain range. There were some who didn’t possess Ice Resistance, so they were weakened as they entered, but the enemy forces would have sustained a similar penalty. It wasn’t too big a deal.\n’Plus, there’s something I’ve prepared for that as well.’\nThree hours later, his subordinates had quickly scaled the mountain and arrived in front of the command center. Then, Lee Shin Woo spread hundreds of bones in front of them. His subordinates watched vacantly as he did so, and he explained his actions kindly to them.\n\"These are the bones of the monsters which had previously inhabited this area. If you each pick one up, it’ll make you stronger. If you don’t get Ice Resistance from that, then you’ll be hunting until you do.\"\n\"Shin... Paul Zero, you’re really scary.\"\nHalf of his troops received Beginner Ice Resistance or higher from the absorption, but before they could go on to fight the Imperial Army, they would need to hunt the undead inhabiting the mountain range and be reinforced.\nAnd before it even became dark, all of the Paul Zero troops had gained at least level 5 Beginner Ice Resistance.\n\"It seems like you’re all ready for battle.\"\n[Of course.]\n[As you command, Master.]\n[Thank you very much... for giving me this opportunity, Paul Zero.]\nLee Shin Woo saw the assembled undead before him, which shined with death energy filled goblin fire (especially Shino Rendu), and suddenly wondered how he’d become able to lead all these troops, but soon grinned and discarded that useless thought.\n\"As I’ve already told you, our enemy’s strong. There are many of them, too. But we should be able to sew chaos in their ranks. ...This is for the Giants, who may become our comrades in the future. Be prepared for death, but don’t die.\"\n[I’ll keep that in mind!]\n\"Paul Zero... you really are cool.\"\n\"Humph!\"\nWith this, everything was in place. Now all they had to do was execute their plan.\nLee Shin Woo saw his subordinates yell vigorously, imagined the moment that he proved his ’pride’ to the Giants and their resulting reactions, and laughed wickedly.\n\"Good. Then, shall we begin!?\"\nFinally, the curtain had risen; now, they would hunt one of the 12 generals in earnest.\nIn a place unknown, most secretly and splendidly.",

    "content": "<Chapter 32. Titan’s Pride - 1>\n[Prince Altania: Everyone else thinks you’ve been hiding your level all this time.]\n\"Huh?\"\nHe’d finished deploying his soldiers, but before he began hunting Metafel in earnest, Lee Shin Woo contacted Prince through the chatting channel to get a feel for what his seniors, the ones who didn’t appear in the chatting channel often (especially Ethan Cruz), were doing.\n[Prince Altania: It doesn’t matter what I say; they don’t believe that you grew that quickly. Lloyd is convinced that you were halfway through level 6 when you first got here. Like that Kratia girl.]\n\"Well, there’s really no problem with them thinking that way...\"\n[Prince Altania: Moreover, you’re close with that girl. They think you’re both the same. Of the two, at least you’re the one with manners. Apparently, they all think that you didn’t want to brag in front of your seniors, so you acted like you were weak.]\n\"I’m glad they think of me so highly.\"\n[Prince Altania: So what’s the truth anyway?]\n\"What do you think, Senior?\"\nLee Shin Woo countered with his own question. Prince pondered briefly and spoke.\n[Prince Altania: I think it’s the opposite. You were lower than level 4 when you first entered the Empire, weren’t you? But you lied because you thought it looked too suspicious to be leveling up so quickly, right?]\n\"...As expected of you, Senior.\"\n[Prince Altania: Humph, as I thought!]\nPrince, who’d briefly seen Lee Shin Woo’s unbelievable growth rate firsthand, would know. She swelled with pride at getting to the right conclusion and spoke proudly.\n[Prince Altania: I saw it all! You risk your life and boldly charge forward, and when you decide to do something, you follow through, so there’s no way your growth rate would be slow! Moreover, you have a growth buff skill. This was probably helpful too.]\nThis adorable girl tended to genuinely compliment other people when she was in a good mood. It was obvious that she’d be embarrassed later when she remembered what she had said.\n[Prince Altania: But there’s no helping it. Not risking your life means that you’ve gotten used to the Underground Empire. That’s why Lloyd can’t believe that you risked your life so many times and grew. He’s not particularly jealous of you per se, but he simply believes that, as a hero, you’re too reckless.]\n\"Jealous? Why would he be jealous of me?\"\n[Prince Altania: Ah... ah, it’s nothing.]\nAnd she also tended to say things without meaning to. Once more, Lee Shin Woo realized that he couldn’t tell her his secrets, and decided to move on without focusing on what she’d just said.\n\"Then that’s fine. Please keep training hard until we meet again. Kratia’s also training really hard right now.\"\nHe was trying to provoke Prince, but it was also true. Since Kratia was taking control of all the mana in the mountain range.\n[Prince Altania: Keuk, of course she is. I’ll win the next time! Ah, you can’t tell Lloyd what I told you, ok? Since everyone else has decided to not worry about your level from now on!]\n\"Of course.\"\nIt was funny that she actually said that they ’wouldn’t worry about his level from now on’. Lee Shin Woo finished his chat with Prince and raised his head. He shared his vision with Rem and was able to clearly see where his forces were moving, as well as where the enemy forces were wandering around.\n\"These guys really are lost. At this rate, they’ll actually go outside.\"\n\"What do we do if they do leave?\"\n\"Ah, they can’t. You see, if they lose track of the flow of mana, then they’ll never be able to get out of this mountain range.\"\n\"...\"\nJin pledged that he wouldn’t leave Lee Shin Woo’s side, and ran across the steep hill. It was all covered with ice, so it was slippery, but Jin used his Steel Heart skill to create Eisen. [1] He didn’t have any problems running, as the iron tool he’d created at the bottom of his feet kept him from slipping.\n\"But it’s really quiet. I can’t believe there are thousands of undead following us in these mountains.\"\n\"The Giants are engaged in battle. The Chi Pauls are as well. Shino Rendu’s really scary. He broke off a cliff to annihilate two corps and is moving on to the next point.\"\n\"...\"\nFrom an outside view, mother nature was silent, but beyond, there was a fierce battle underway even now. Was this also because of the mana? It was, to be honest.\nAs the space expanded, several places in the mountain range were blocked off, so it was difficult to communicate here, and it was especially difficult to command a huge army like Metafel’s.\nIt would’ve been difficult for Lee Shin Woo as well, had it not been for his Darkness mana and its resulting links. And if it weren’t for him stealing Metafel’s magical device (which had split into six pieces), then this operation would’ve been impossible.\n\"Chi Paul, just go straight. They’re behind that small forest. There’s a level 7 elite there. You know that this task is really important, right? The Erem corps will attack from behind simultaneously. Kill them together. If you can kill a level 7 elite, then the strength of their army will lessen.\"\n[I understand.]\n\"Shino, you’re charging too fast. If you go that fast, you’ll lose valuable troops. For now, just make sure you collect all the loot. There’s a squad at 7 o’clock, so kill them and then come back. Remember, you’re still weaker than Metafel. Take your time with your revenge; it won’t be too late.\"\n[Keuk... I understand.]\nLee Shin Woo ordered his troops whilst riding atop Jin, and watched the Giants carefully, as he couldn’t relay his orders to them directly.\nThe level 5 Giants would draw the enemies’ attention, and the level 6 Giants would be responsible for the actual hunting. He knew that their strength may not be sufficient, so he had stationed the level 7 Giants on standby just in case. Lee Shin Woo was looking after them so meticulously that the Giants didn’t really sustain many casualties.\n[Kuwaaaaaaaaah! How dare you covet the land of the Giants, you lowly humans!]\n[How dare you! I’ll show you that our fury hasn’t waned in the least!]\nThe Giants reacted to the Imperial Army particularly violently and engaged in battle. While it wasn’t difficult for them to overcome their foes, it was difficult to get them to retreat at the right times.\n\"You’ve already killed them all! Direct your anger at the Imperial troops over there!\"\n[Ah, Paul Zero...!]\n[Ah, is that so? I got it!]\n\"Hoo, they’re being pushed back over there. Jin, run towards 3 o’clock!\"\nLee Shin Woo had to even account for insubordination and somewhat regretted bringing the Giants into the fold (under his command). He moved again and again. His nonexistent eyes surveyed the battlefield and he commanded his troops.\n[Kuhahk!? T-The Giants have attacked first...!]\n[Reinforcements... Request for reinforcements! General Metafel!]\nWere his efforts finally paying off? The enemy forces hadn’t realized that they were being attacked, as the Paul Zero Corps, as well as the Giants had been attacking them for three hours now. ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ novel★fire.net\nBut in the midst of that, Lee Shin Woo discovered a bizarre phenomenon, which made him feel uneasy. The undead, which had been wandering around the mountain range, had at some point, begun moving in a more organized fashion.\n’As expected... The troops spread out across the mountain range are getting closer and closer to Metafel. What kind of cheat skill is this? They’re moving faster than privates being ordered around by their superior.’\nLee Shin Woo couldn’t figure out what Metafel’s ability was. He would be in trouble if he hadn’t asked Kratia for help, in case of a situation like this.\n[Kratia Melloi: Shin Woo, this is really boring.]\n\"It’s the most important job, so I’m counting on you.\"\nWhat was Kratia’s job? Her ability to control cold air, which had been amplified to its very limit...\n[Keuk... Damn it. Since when did this glacial mountain become so cold?]\n[General, the wind’s somewhat weak here. Please command the troops to go this way...!]\nShe dispersed her mana far and wide, and by controlling the cold air, Kratia made it so that Metafel’s guards couldn’t command the main force while keeping them from finding the right path. She had to stop Metafel from personally commanding his troops at all costs!\n[Kratia Melloi: I’d rather fight.]\n\"If you think you can kill him with your magic, then by all means.\"\n[Kratia Melloi: ...It’d be a bit tough.]\nKratia said honestly. That’s because Kratia was well aware of the arcane magic artifact that Metafel wore. Despite her cold air being high rank and a high level, all she could do was hamper his movements a little bit.\nOf course, if Kratia’s arcane magic actually hit Metafel, then she would have a chance, but he’d counterattack before she had the chance.\n[Kratia Melloi: How is it on your end?]\n\"I did my best, but... It seems like I won’t be able to stop the current. I feel like we should just collect the loot while we still have the chance before they regroup. If you feel like you’re at your limit, then retreat to a different location and then come back.\"\n[Kratia Melloi: Ok.]\nIt seemed like Kratia’s mood livened up a bit, as he’d essentially given her permission to go wild. Lee Shin Woo finished chatting with her and began moving once more.\nThere was a setback in his plan because of Metafel’s strange morale ability, but in any case, since his strategy had succeeded, he cut down their force of 50,000 by at least 10,000. He’d have to be satisfied with this for now.\n\"Go back to your territory. Treat your comrades who’ve been hurt there.\"\n[I got it.]\nThe Giants’ domain, Perlin Elta, was the most heterogeneous space at the center of the mountain range. The level 5 Giant who’d guided him into the village seemed a bit stronger than before, and it wasn’t Lee Shin Woo just seeing things.\nThe bizarre mana that flowed through the entirety of Perlin Elta invigorated the Giants and healed their wounds as well. In more extreme terms, it could be said that their ’existences’ would briefly ascend. The reason behind that was easy to ascertain. It was the doing of the frozen Titan’s Heart.\n’So I’m sure that the Titan’s Heart affects the Giant Tribe. But what exactly is it?’\nIt was bad enough that he had to take on Metafel, but he’d have to study the Titan’s Heart as well. Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and moved his body.\nHe’d ordered the Giants to return to Perlin Elta, where their wounds would be healed in the nick of time, so now it was time to take care of his own troops.\n\"Shino, stop right there! I already have the Giants to worry about for insubordination.\"\n[Keuk, I found traces of another squad while we were returning, so... I’m sorry. We’ll return immediately.]\n\"Good. But it’s good that you had the foresight to prepare for an enemy attack and keep the injured safe beforehand. Go back and rest.\"\nFirst, he would directly order his troops, which were difficult to command, to return. Then, he found the Chi Paul corps, as well as the Erem corps, which were both fighting against the level 7 elite.\nFortunately, they had prioritized safety above all else, so they hadn’t sustained many casualties. However, they hadn’t succeeded in taking down the level 7 elite yet. Then again, it wouldn’t be that easy to take down one of the Imperial Army’s level 7 elites.\n[Who’s commanding you two...! You’re not on the same side as that strange guy that appeared yesterday, are you!?]\n[Ha, strange guy? You really are a poor judge of character. Then again, your eyes are rotten.]\nLee Shin Woo looked down at the battlefield from a slightly higher area. The Chi Pauls and the Erems were ripping the enemy forces apart, and in the center, the level 7 Chi Paul was fighting against the level 7 elite Corps Commander by itself. It was that guy, the one Lee Shin Woo had met for the first time when he was with Metafel yesterday!\n\"Triple Lightning!\"\n[Kuhahk!?]\nLee Shin Woo and Jin fell, and the level 7 elite, who was clashing blades with Chi Paul, was unable to resist Lee Shin Woo’s ’greeting’ and got swept away. Because he’d simultaneously activated both Lightning Sprint and Lightning Shadow, it seemed as though a lightning bolt had fallen from the sky!\n[T-This is... the Lightning Shadow General’s...?]\n\"I’ll let you see the Lightning Shadow General soon, so stay right there! Ground Lightning!\"\nDozens of lightning bolts came from the icy ground and attacked. Even though it was flustered, the level 7 elite managed to dodge the lightning, but Chi Paul, who was holding a giant greatsword that resembled a sharp saw blade, was waiting from behind it.\n[Now do you realize how rotten your eyes were?]\n[Kuhahk!? If you’re truly a knight, then you wouldn’t do something as cowardly as...]\n[Heup!]\n\"Ha!\"\nChi Paul didn’t listen to it. Lee Shin Woo was the same. Chi Paul had been formed from the fusion of countless knights’ souls, so there were no gaps in its sword technique. While defending against Chi Paul’s attack, it lost its weapon, and a Breath of the Lightning God fell upon its head once more.\n[Keoheok!]\nThe lightning and the sharp blade immediately broke through its helmet and burrowed into its skull. At that moment, the Corps Commander realized that there was no way it could escape alive.\n[S-Sir Metafel...!]\n\"Yeah, I’ll send him to you soon.\"\nLee Shin Woo replied with disinterest and exploded the sword burrowed in its body. His skills in handling mana were so great now that even if he exploded the sword right before him, the resulting explosion wouldn’t damage him or his allies in the least.\n[You have acquired 6,196,550 Perium.]\n[You have acquired the Lv7 Ghoul Knight Leader’s jawbone.]\nLee Shin Woo snatched the loot and placed it atop Chi Paul’s shoulder, who was just starting to straighten himself out and stand up. He was going to use Bone Reinforcement on him.\n\"This is for you.\"\n[But I didn’t take him down by myself...!]\n\"So after you absorb this, you’ll be able to take down a guy like that by yourself next time. Right?\"\n[...Yes, no matter what!]\nJin watched their exchange and thought that if this were a game, he would’ve seen a message like [Loyalty + 500] or something. Lee Shin Woo probably just did it because he thought it would’ve been more efficient to let Chi Paul absorb it than himself!\n[Thank you very much, Paul Zero. I feel like I’ve gotten a lot stronger!]\n\"Good. If that’s the case, then come with me and return. We’ll move on to the next battle after everyone’s been healed.\"\n[I understand!]\nAfter he’d succeeded in his ambush, Lee Shin Woo led his troops and returned to base. Some of the giants had been slain, but none of his own troops; it seemed like his troops’ tough undead bodies were helpful, as they were all healed within a few hours.\nAt the last minute, Kratia had cast widespread ice magic that crumbled the entire mountain and had returned with a refreshed expression. With her help, they had cut down Metafel’s forces by 13,000 (including the death of one level 7 elite).\nIt was a perfect victory.\n[1] E/N: German for Iron, I assume iron calkins or cleats for horses.",

    "content": "<Chapter 32. Titan’s Pride - 2>\n[You have annihilated a fourth of the enemy army with a limited number of troops, while simultaneously commanding the Giants, who hate outsiders. By understanding the enemy and effectively using the environment, you were able to achieve the best possible outcome. You have the right to be called the Ruler of the Battlefield.]\n[You have acquired the title ’Commander of Terror’. The abilities of all forces under your control are buffed by 10%! Whenever you achieve an exceptional result in battle, this title will evolve.]\n[All stats have increased by 10 as a result of the title. The High Rank Command skill has become Lv2 and all stats have increased by 5.]\nLee Shin Woo had achieved victory so seamlessly that he gained a title, and in the evening used the bones his troops brought back to reinforce them. Because most of the bones belonged to normal soldiers, his troops didn’t grow much, but low leveled bones were best for healing injuries.\n[Paul Zero made me a level 5!]\nAnd those who came back with level 5, level 6, or elite bones became noticeably stronger. He collected all the bones of the foes that the Giants had slain (the Giants didn’t realize the value of either the bones or the Perium) and reinforced the Pauls with them, allowing them to grow far more than he’d initially expected.\n[Ooh, Paul Zero is expanding our original limitations...!]\n\"This is the result of all your hard work. Don’t think about your limitations from now on. You can always keep growing.\"\n[Paul Zero!]\n[Paul Zero! Paul Zero!]\n\"They’re fanatics...! They really are fanatical...!\"\n\"It’s nothing new.\"\nHe planned on using all but a few of the bones on his subordinates, but considering how some of the Pauls went up to level 5, he knew that he’d made the right choice. And...\n[We’ll try even harder. You won’t regret giving us this chance.]\n\"Of course I won’t. I trust in your potential.\"\nShino Rendu’s role in the battle had been considerable, so if he kept this up, he might get to level 7. Contrary to when he was a hero, as an Undead Avenger, Shino Rendu went through fire and water to hunt and absorb bones, which allowed him to grow at an overwhelmingly fast pace.\n\"Good. Everyone, good work. Rest up until I give you your new orders. Ah, gather the Perium over here.\"\n[I understand!]\n[For Commander Paul Zero!]\n\"...There’s a hill of karma gathering next to you, Paul Zero.\"\nIn exchange for reinforcing his troops with all the bones, Lee Shin Woo took all the Perium. As they’d crushed 13,000 enemy troops, he gained a surprising 170 million Perium. Apparently, the price of level 7 medicine was 1 million Perium, the Perium was equivalent to karma that increased his stats by a total of 170.\n\"To have only gotten this much after crushing a quarter of that huge army. Now I’m starting to understand how hard our seniors have to work to raise their stats.\"\n\"Man, these guys are really stingy compared to dungeon monsters.\"\n\"They are, aren’t they? If you want to level up this way, then even destroying an entire army belonging to one of the 12 generals wouldn’t be enough.\"\n\"You’re saying something weird again. Raise your stats by training your skills, not using the medicine. The medicine is just a bonus!\"\nTo be honest, Lee Shin Woo was slightly worried. While he always took the Perium from his subordinates, he’d taken the Perium from the Giants this time as well. Follow current novels on novel~fire~net\nBut it seemed as though commanding and leading them into battle saved their lives and strengthened them in the process. Acquiring the bones and Perium from them was not an issue at all.\nWhat’s worse, a Giant had killed a level 6 elite, who possessed a level 4 artifact, but they had just given it away.\n\"So is this what it means to command a corps? I took all this stuff from them, but it’s allowed since I’m their commander. This is the best!\"\n\"Ah, Paul Zero’s on a path of no return...\"\nFor now, Lee Shin Woo just collected all of the Perium. Since he hadn’t bought any bones from the secret shop lately, he’d just been accumulating Perium. With this new addition, his total was close to 400 million Perium, but he increasingly felt like he should save his permits and his Perium.\n\"Ah, now that I think about it, I didn’t sell my wine yet either.\"\n\"So how’s that going lately?\"\n\"I expanded the storehouse, and the golems are continuously creating and maturing the wine.\"\n\"...I feel a bit sorry for the Dryads.\"\nOnce Lee Shin Woo had re-checked his forces, he created a few guerilla units consisting of elites, although all his troops looked battle ready. They were responsible for sewing chaos amongst the enemy troops so that they wouldn’t find the Giants’ domain.\n[We can do it if you just give us the order.]\n\"Alright.\"\nLee Shin Woo assigned the level 7 Wolf Avenger, Bisher Moon as the leader of the guerilla units, as he possessed high magic and could see from far distances. Also, those who followed him possessed Ice Resistance, as well as acid and poison abilities. As expected, the most effective tools in killing a large number of enemy troops with just a handful of soldiers were poison and acid.\n\"I’ll send a squad to collect the loot later on, so focus on sowing chaos. They have this strange instinct to gather around their Corps Commander, so try your best to stop them. If you think you can’t, then retreat immediately.\"\n[I understand!]\nLee Shin Woo created a recon squad composed of individuals who could move quickly. This mountain range was much too vast and the natural environment was much too perilous for him to rely solely on Rem’s vision. Because the cold winds were so intense, he never knew when the topography would change.\nHe had already figured this out, so if he wanted to plan out a proper strategy for the following day, then creating a recon unit was paramount.\n\"Kratia, I’m counting on you to keep watch.\"\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\"To the Giants. I’ll go check how they’re doing and then come back. They’re probably still excited since it’s been such a long time since they’ve fought.\"\n\"Ah.\"\nEven if Kratia had the ability to command several troops, she was sure that she wouldn’t be able to do what Lee Shin Woo did. Checking the condition of the Giants, inspiring his troops, keeping watch, sowing chaos amongst the enemy troops, and being prepared for what the enemy threw at them next; there weren’t just one or two things that he had to do.\nShe became curious as to where Lee Shin Woo had come from and what he did there, as he did all these difficult tasks so seamlessly. There was so much she wanted to ask him, but ultimately, Kratia just shrugged her shoulders instead.\n\"Leave it to me. Even if Metafel himself comes, I’ll be able to stop him for a little while.\"\n\"Good. Then, I’m counting on you.\"\nLee Shin Woo left his troops to Kratia and went over to the Giants’ domain. He had somewhat expected this, but the Giants looked ready to leave their territory whenever.\n[There are still... enemies... in this mountain range.]\n[I can’t forget the pleasure of breaking their skulls and stomping on their legs. I can still crush so many more enemies!]\n[I’m still... in good condition! Why am I still here...?]\n[Paul Zero. Paul Zero is here!]\nWhile they were busy raising their morale, Lee Shin Woo came to visit them. The hundreds of Giants simultaneously rushed over to Lee Shin Woo and shouted.\n[You said you’d help us in our fight... not that you’d... get in our way!]\n[I’m going...! I respect you, so I waited patiently, but... I cannot wait any longer!]\n[Kuhaaaaaaaaaaah! The Titan is watching over us. We are still as invincible as ever, and we’ll always be invincible!]\n\"All of you, calm down.\"\n[Ugh...!]\nLee Shin Woo saw an immediate difference now that his High Rank Command became level 2. Compared to yesterday, Lee Shin Woo had seemed to become even more dignified than before, so the Giants became a bit quieter. He used that opportunity to draw his sword.\n\"Look.\"\n[What are you trying to show us with your sword... Huh?]\nHe wasn’t concerned with the Giants flinching and quickly drew a picture atop the icy ground. His picture portrayed the number and the location of the troops based on Rem’s last findings.\n\"Our fight today was close to perfect. But it won’t always be this easy. Do you see? That they’re concentrating their forces around the Corps Commander. We succeeded because we divided and conquered, but if we hadn’t, then we would’ve lost a lot of comrades.\"\n[If that’s the case, then shouldn’t be attacking!? By killing more, we prevent them from regrouping!]\n\"We came out victorious because we only fought until we couldn’t anymore. If we were greedy for more, then you would’ve been hurt.\"\nHe was sure now that Metafel possessed a skill that caused his troops to gather around him or an artifact with a similar effect!\nDespite Kratia using large scale magic to collapse a mountain, Metafel’s troops began to gather around him more and more, rather than them wandering and getting lost. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the ability was supernatural. Now he was sure that the Archmage hadn’t sent Metafel’s corps here for no reason.\n’Even if something goes wrong with the artifact, he trusted that Metafel’s ability would take care of the rest. It’s frustrating, but he picked well. As expected of the 12 generals...’\n[If that’s the case, then...]\n\"Huh?\"\nLee Shin Woo finished thinking and raised his head. The level 7 Giant, which unlike the empty-headed Giants, had ’followed his orders and had grown considerably’, looked at him seriously (although his eyes were rotten).\n[Then that means we have to figure out how to move now. Isn’t that why you came? To tell us that? Humans are weak, but I’m well aware of how strong they get when they bunch together. You’re telling us not to charge in head-on against them.]\n\"Exactly. I’ve come to tell you my strategy.\"\nLee Shin Woo was deeply moved. It became so much easier to explain since there was someone who actually understood what he was talking about. Once the level 7 Giant spoke, the hostile level 5 and level 6 Giants quieted down.\n\"I told you this before, but the reason we were able to put up such a good fight was because we stopped the enemies from grouping up and only fought against the troops that were divided from the main force. So what do we do against them, now that they’ve gathered into one main force?\"\nLee Shin Woo drew a line through the 37,000 undead on his rough map. He cut off the tail end of the group.\nThen, he drew another line, and then another one after that. He drew dozens of lines until there was only one small group of enemies remaining.\n\"It’s fundamentally the same. We divided and conquer. Thus far, we’ve been doing our utmost to keep them from grouping up, but from now on, we’ll cut down that main force and lessen its size.\"\n[How?]\n\"With mother nature.\"\nIf this were flatland, then this strategy wouldn’t work. And if they weren’t Giants, then it would likewise be impossible. But in this glacial mountain range, the ’Titans’ were capable of controlling mother nature with ease.\n\"If we don’t have a wall, then we’ll just break a hill and make one. If the ground they’re walking on is stable, then make it unstable. Become nature’s fury and cajole your enemies. When they fall to chaos, then we’ll cut them down bit by bit. It’s time to show them how impressive you really are.\"\n[How impressive we really are...]\n[Nature’s fury...]\nDid Lee Shin Woo’s words reach them? Once the Giants heard him, the Giants smiled faintly with their rotten lips. Lee Shin Woo’s jawbone rattled, as he had succeeded in using them to ’set up traps’.\n[I feel like you’re worthy now.]\nAnd then, one of the level 7 Giants said abruptly.\n[I suppose it’s alright to show you the Titan’s Heart, as you’re a human who understands a Giant’s strength and is acknowledged by the Giants.]\n\"Oh...!?\"\nAnd now, he unexpectedly had the chance to advance his goals.",

    "content": "<Chapter 32. Titan’s Pride - 3>\nLee Shin Woo was walking into the inner part of the Giants’ domain with one of the level 7 Giants. From an outside view, it looked like nothing more than an ordinary snow-covered field, but he felt like he was blocked by a barrier of mana around halfway through.\nAlthough he knew this barrier wasn’t physically stopping him from entering, it was a barrier that would lead one astray and force them to go in another direction. In other words, it was similar to the spatial barrier that prevented access into the mountain range.\n[It’s in here. You should be able to follow us through.]\n\"Of course.\"\nDue to the leading Giant, the barrier was temporarily removed, and the correct path appeared. Of course, a normal person would find it difficult to follow, but to Lee Shin Woo, who had figured out the right way to enter the mountain range, it wasn’t very difficult. No, even if the Giant hadn’t been here, he would’ve been able to figure it out.\n\"The spatial divergence is severe, even within the Giants’ domain...\"\n[It’s a barrier created by the Titan’s Heart itself. Only us Giants are permitted to enter.]\n\"As I thought. This is what it means to be descendants of the Titans...\"\n[Indeed.]\nAs he followed the Giant, Lee Shin Woo felt apologetic to Kratia, as he’d left her behind and was going to see the Titan’s Heart without her. However... it couldn’t be helped, as there was no way that the Giants, who hadn’t yet fully overcome their instincts, would accept her.\n\"Do we have to walk for a while?\"\n[We’ll be there soon.]\nThe Giant really did stop soon. The snowy field had changed into a giant icy hill before their eyes. Lee Shin Woo felt a ridiculous amount of cold air and his body shook.\n\"As expected...\"\n[Did you hear everything from Fennos?]\n\"No, not everything.\"\n[I see...]\nThe Giant muttered sadly and pointed towards the hill. It seemed preposterous, but it seemed like the root cause of the cold air that froze the entire mountain range was this hill.\n[The Titan’s Heart is inside here. Originally, the Titan controlled overwhelming heat rather than cold, but so much time has passed since the Titan had died that the last remaining trace of that individual has, as you can see... it spews out cold air, rather than hot.]\n\"Hmm, how interesting...\"\nLee Shin Woo didn’t really know much about cold-related artifacts, aside from Kratia’s orb. But why was it? He felt familiar energy coming from the center of the hill.\nHe attempted to get closer and study the Titan’s Heart buried within more in-depth. But at that moment...\n[Who has come?]\n[Who did you bring?]\nTwo Giants suddenly ran down from the top of the hill, casting a dark shadow over Lee Shin Woo’s head. When he raised his head, the Giants that lay before his eyes were the most powerful and largest Giants amongst all the Giants he’d seen thus far.\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t surprised, as he knew who they were better than anyone else.\n[Lv7 Sealed Titan Zombie - Ellata]\n[Lv7 Sealed Titan Zombie - Arogan]\nBoth of them were previously heroes, and they were probably made into heroes even earlier than Lee Man Bok... as heroes that were born on this planet.\nThey survived through the day disaster befell the Empire, and they were picked by God and carried out her orders, but... they couldn’t overcome the 12 generals and despite them being betrayed by their allies and becoming corpses, they regained their wills and had returned here. They had remained as Giants, not normal undead.\n[It’s someone who can understand us, oh mother and father.]\n[Someone who can understand us...]\n\"I’m Paul Zero.\"\nLee Shin Woo confidently introduced himself to his two senior heroes, whereas the two undead heroes just kept watching the hill where the Titan’s Heart was buried. He wouldn’t be able to sleep until he could figure out what this familiar feeling was. Not that he could sleep.\n\"I have inherited Fenno’s will, and have come here to retrieve the Titan’s Pride.\"\n[To think you’d speak the Titan’s name.]\n[Fennos? What a nostalgic name. So you met him.]\n\"That’s right.\"\nSurprisingly, the two Giants weren’t really suspicious of him, nor did they reject him. They were the strongest of the Giants, those who scorned human beings, so it wouldn’t have been strange at all if they were to have attacked him as soon as they saw him.\nLee Shin Woo thought about it briefly and realized. They were probably helped by Lee Man Bok. If that was their last contact with a human being, then he could understand why they were acting this way.\n[Though you knew Fennos...]\n[It seems like you’re quite close to this human, for you to suggest that he see the Titan’s Heart. However, the Titan’s Heart is the symbol of the Giants, so bringing him here was thoughtless of you.]\n[That’s not the issue right now, mother, father.]\n[...What?]\nAh, perhaps this guy is...? Hearing that, Lee Shin Woo looked at the level 7 Giant in astonishment. To think he’d say that the Titan’s Heart, which all the Giants treasured ’wasn’t the issue right now’?\nIt was at that moment that Lee Shin Woo realized something. That this Giant hadn’t brought him all the way over to just show him the Titan’s Heart. Rather, the Titan’s Heart was probably just an excuse to ask him for something.\n[What are you talking about? Explain in detail.]\n[I’m not a very good speaker, so I’ll let this human explain. This human knows how to honor our will, so please hear him out.]\nThe level 7 Giants bowed its head towards the previous heroes. Lee Shin Woo thought ’as expected’ and nodded his head. The level 7 Giant had brought him here to persuade these two Giants to fight against the Imperial Army with them. To think that the Giant that had ignored him at the beginning was doing so much for him now.\n[...I thought you’d completely degenerated into the undead, but you’ve regained your intellect.]\n[How surprising. Is this change your doing as well?]\n\"Yeah.\"\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo had no intention of doing exactly what the Giant wanted. He gave them suitable responses whilst quickly analyzing the Titan’s Heart.\nHe was finally getting a feel for it. If the Titan’s Heart was indeed what Lee Shin Woo thought it was, then it would be a waste to just sit around doing this...!\n[Not only has a human come into a forbidden area, but we’re listening to what he has to say as well...]\n[I’m sure that something’s going on. It’s good that the messenger has regained a bit of his intellect, but he probably came with grave news as well.]\n\"You said this is a forbidden area, right?\"\n[That’s right, human. We’re thinking about whether we should punish this one for allowing you, a human, into the forbidden area, or if we should consider you friendly enough to allow you into this area.]\n[What exactly did you do to bring back their intellect? Although they’re better off than the undead teeming within the Empire, they’re ultimately still undead.]\n\"...Hoo.\"\nAt that moment, Lee Shin Woo raised his head.\nHis analysis of the Titan’s Heart was complete. It was exactly as Lee Shin Woo had thought. He realized how to truly ’awaken’ the Giants.\n\"There are those who are trying to invade that forbidden area. They are aiming for the Titan’s Heart.\"\nIt was the second act of his play.\n[And that’s not you?]\nMm, a logical response. Moreover, it’s actually correct. However, Lee Shin Woo brushed it off and continued.\n\"I came here to protect that, or more specifically, the Giants themselves. If you’re ready to hear me out, then I’ll keep going.\"\n[...]\n[Let’s hear him out. I feel a familiar energy from this guy. It’s similar to Man Bok’s. The energy similar to our friend, who rescued us and helped us regain our intellect.]\n[Ugh... Alright, let’s hear him out.]\nThey would be pissed if they found out that Lee Shin Woo had killed Lee Man Bok. Lee Shin Woo inwardly grinned and continued.\n\"It’s the Imperial Army. One of the 12 generals is with them at that, the Mercenary King, Metafel. There are 50,000 troops coming this way. They’ve come through the mountain range with a magical device that nullifies the spatial inference. I stole that away from them, but they’re gathering through an innate ability.\"\n[Metafel Rerdan...!]\n[Grr... He’s the guy who killed Meljoo...!] [1]\n\"I’m helping the Giants stop them with my own forces, but there will be several casualties amongst the Giants in the ensuing battle. If they’re unlucky, then they may be completely annihilated. We need your help in order to stop them.\"\n[Metafel... How dare he...!]\n[Even so, we have to protect the Titan’s Heart.]\n[...Indeed. It’s even more important that we stay here, knowing that Metafel is aiming for the Titan’s Heart.] Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs NoveIꜰire.net\nDespite their hatred of Metafel, they prioritized staying by the Titan’s Heart and protecting it, rather than vengeance.\nIt wasn’t like they were scared of Metafel. That’s just how important they considered the Titan’s Heart. Lee Shin Woo realized just how important the Titan’s Heart was to them. If that’s the case, then... Lee Shin Woo lightly provoked them.\n\"Of course, you don’t have to worry about it too much. Since I’ll kill Metafel before you even get a chance to see him.\"\n[...If that’s the case, then there’s no reason for us to be even having this discussion.]\nLee Shin Woo would kill Metafel, not the Giants. They understood what he had said and he’d left an impression on them, but it’s not like that would be enough for them to respond with ’I’m going to kill Metafel myself!’. So Lee Shin Woo furrowed his brow, nodded his head, and spoke.\n\"That’s right. The Giants may perish, but you’ll be able to protect the Titan’s Heart.\"\n[That’s our (the Giants’) mission that has been passed down from generation to generation. Those who die shouldn’t have any complaints.]\n[But still, father, mother...!]\nThe level 7 Giant who was listening from beside them looked as though he were burning up. Now that he thought about it, the one who had been hit by the level 7 elite’s arrow and had been complaining the entire time was this guy.\nAs expected, at the time he was consumed by rage, but as time passed he came to realize that the level 7 elite was stronger than he was.\n\"Yeah, there’s nothing for you to worry about. Until the next batter is up, that is.\"\n[The next batter?]\nHearing that, the Giants flinched. Had they really not expected this? Lee Shin Woo snorted and continued. He hadn’t planned on telling them this, but the situation was different now.\n\"Isn’t it obvious? Would the Empire really give up on this place with just the loss of Metafel? Rather, they’ll come out even more aggressively next time, as they’d have lost one of the 12 generals. At the very least, Feotane Von Seldin would be included in the next punitive force.\"\n[...]\nIf that happened, then the Giants would be exterminated for sure. No matter how much they used the terrain to their advantage, or how well they planned, they wouldn’t be able to block that single absolute being, despite their best efforts.\n\"I’ve come here to persuade you (the Giants) and retrieve the Titan’s Pride. But I haven’t come here to die. I’m going to run before then. Moreover, now that I look at you guys... it seems like you’ve become too greedy. You two, the leaders of the Giants, don’t seem to know what’s really important here.\"\n[It’s the Titan’s Heart. The most important thing to us is the Titan’s Heart!]\nYeah, that Titan’s Heart. They’d finally gotten to the key to the problem. Lee Shin Woo extended his hand, gestured to the icy hill, and smiled coldly.\n\"Of course, this is a great treasure. But right now, it’s nothing more than an item that’s emitting cold air and slightly boosting your energy.\"\n[How dare you!]\nThe Giant on the left side, Ellata couldn’t hold themselves back anymore and swung its greatsword at Lee Shin Woo. The giant weapon seemed to contain enough force to cleave through a mountain, yet... Lee Shin Woo blocked it with the Titan’s Pride.\n[That shield...!?]\nLee Shin Woo didn’t even blink at the astonished reaction of the Giant.\n\"At this rate, you guys will be annihilated, and the Titan’s Heart you hold so dear will be taken away from you. You said the thing most important to you is the Titan’s Heart, right? What you’re doing is pretty much giving it to the Empire on a silver platter.\"\n[Keuk!]\nKwang! The force behind the Giant’s greatsword finally broke apart the Titan’s Pride. Before the greatsword could continue on its course and break Lee Shin Woo as well, he summoned a second shield and blocked its strike once more. Lee Shin Woo saw the speechless, gaping Giant and smiled bitterly.\n\"If it’s so precious to you, and if you truly want to protect it so badly, then you can’t just be sitting here doing nothing. The Empire already knows where it is. They also have a way to find it. So do you really think you’ll be able to protect the Titan’s Heart on your own?\"\n[We ca...!]\n\"Can’t.\"\n[Keuk...!]\nLee Shin Woo mercilessly cut them down. A giant attempted to refute his claims, but when it saw his blazing goblin fire, it couldn’t follow through.\nHow could they stop the level 8 Archmage from taking the Titan’s Heart when they couldn’t even beat a weak skeleton? The intellect that he’d barely been able to preserve was telling him. That the undead in front of him was telling the truth. Everything was over, so long as the Empire had a way of locating the Titan’s Heart.\n\"So, our job isn’t to stay here and protect this thing.\"\n[Our?]\n\"Yeah, ’our’.\"\nLee Shin Woo grinned. At some point, a gigantified Breath of the Lightning God floated in the air. The mana consumption was tremendous, as it had been gigantified, but its dignity was undeniable.\n\"Our job is...\"\nLee Shin Woo dropped his hand lightly. At that moment, the Breath of the Lightning God shot out like an arrow and burrowed into the icy hill. Seeing that, the Giants were shocked and moved to stop him, but it was already too late.\nThe tough ice it’d burrowed into began to crack, and once the Breath of the Lightning God began to emit lightning, the cracks spread throughout the entirety of the hill.\n[Are you trying to break apart the Titan’s Heart!?]\n\"Nope.\"\nThe hill, which boasted an incredible toughness from the many years of repeated freezing, was broken in an instant. That ice was saturated in mana, which wasn’t very important.\nWhat was important was what appeared inside.\n[Lv8 Damaged Titan Golem Core]\n\"Our job is...\"\nLee Shin Woo looked at the ’Titan’s Heart’, which had been stripped of its outer coating and even now was releasing cold air... No, it was actually a golem core that was sucking all the heat from its surrounding, and he said.\n\"To revive the Titan.\"\n[1] T/N: Rather than a ’Grr’ (a growl), it’s more like the sound when you grind your teeth, but I don’t know a suitable onomatopoeia for that.",

    "content": "<Chapter 32. Titan’s Pride - 4>\n[Revive...]\n[The Titan...?]\n\"Yeah.\"\nLee Shin Woo said nonchalantly, but the Giants froze. They focused their attention on the now exposed core; seeing cold air stick to the top of the core and form ice, even at this very moment, was memorable.\n[As expected, it takes a human to say something so impious with such ease.]\n[The Titan passed away. If a human could’ve revived it, then it would’ve risen long ago.]\n\"Mm, you still don’t get it, even when you’re looking right at it.\"\nLee Shin Woo watched the Titan’s Heart... the Titan Golem Core as it continuously drew in heat from its dented side and smiled bitterly.\nHe realized just how much time had passed when he thought about how the story of a giant golem had transformed into the legend of the Titan. He was sure that it hadn’t occurred within just one hundred or two hundred years. Moreover, there were no traces on the core of it being made by Steelworker! That meant that it wasn’t made by the Empire.\n\"Do you still think the Titan is a god?\"\n[We won’t tolerate any more disrespect. I acknowledge that you’re strong for a human, but the price of looking down upon the Titan’s Pride is death.]\n\"Is that so?\"\nLee Shin Woo replied apathetically. They hadn’t figured it out, even though it was clearly not a living being’s heart. Therefore, he would have to prove it to them in a different way.\n\"Then, just watch.\"\n[You dare!]\nLee Shin Woo extended his hand. While the Giants were overwhelmingly stronger than Lee Shin Woo, they were also extremely slow in exchange. Therefore, when they attempted to stop him, Lee Shin Woo had already reached the core.\n[How dare you!]\n\"Ha.\"\nLee Shin Woo evaded the Giants’ attacks and grabbed the core on the ground. As expected, the moment he held the core, he felt the core attempt to steal all the heat from his body, but fortunately, he could use level 8 Intermediate Fire. So long as he used that, he wouldn’t have to worry about freezing.\n[T-The heart.]\n[That fool... In the end, that human took the Titan’s Heart!]\n[The Titan’s Pride will kill you without fail. When it does, we’ll take back the Titan’s Heart! That’s not just the proof of our ancestors, but the very soul of the Giant Tribe!]\nLee Shin Woo had already blocked out the Giants. All of his attention lay on the Titan Golem Core in his hands. The moment Lee Shin Woo used his power, the core, which had until now been absorbing all heat...\n[Through Bone Reinforcement, the Lv8 Damaged Titan Golem Core is transforming.]\nHe thought it might not transform like the Huginn’s Eye. Fortunately, it did. Perhaps his affinity was high since he’d manufactured golems before and he possessed the Puppet Master title.\n[T-The Titan’s Heart is...!?]\n[Kill himmmmmmmm!]\nThe enraged Giants ran over to Lee Shin Woo, but they couldn’t get too close. While their frames were large, the Titan’s Heart was comparatively small. Therefore, if they tried killing Lee Shin Woo, then there was a chance that they would damage the Titan’s Heart as well, which would be an unforgivable sin.\n\"As I thought, you guys really are undead. Or were you like that when you were alive? You guys are always in a hurry.\"\n[You have acquired the Lv8 Damaged Titan Golem Bone Core.]\nThen, the transformation was complete. Half of the once crimson metal core now looked like a crushed red circular bone.\nOf course, its energy hadn’t reduced in the least from the transformation. Its composition and form had just become easier for Lee Shin Woo to understand. ...And there was one more thing.\n\"I’d thought as much, but it’s still damaged even after the transformation. I don’t think I’ll be able to analyze a thing when it’s in this state. In order to restore it, I’ll have to use Bone Reinforcement... Oh, that’s right.\"\nHe remembered that he could use Bone Reinforcement on the core itself!\nLee Shin Woo mulled over what the suitable materials would be to reinforce it with and soon opened his inventory, pulling out a non-bone item from it. It was none other than the fossil that permanently radiated heat... the Solar Fossil.\n[Consuming the Solar Fossil to reinforce the Damaged Titan Golem Bone Core. The compatibility between the two items is incredibly high! 2% of the Bone Core’s information has been restored!]\n\"Nice!\"\n[...Huh!?]\n[This human.]\n[The Titan’s Heart is...?]\nLee Shin Woo was the only one who could see the messages, yet all the Giants there responded. Why you ask? It’s because the slight authority that was bestowed upon them by the Titan’s Heart (they called it a blessing) had become stronger.\n[What is he doing...?]\n\"I already told you. I’m reviving the Titan.\"\nLee Shin Woo said and reinforced the Bone Core with the second Solar Fossil. The core accepted the Solar Fossil without hesitation, as though it was a chick that was being fed by its mother.\n[A resounding success! 3% of the Bone Core’s information has been restored!]\n[I-It’s gotten stronger again!]\n[Is he truly...? Is a human truly reviving the Titan...?]\nThe Giants were confused. Contrary to their original assumptions, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t stealing the Titan’s Heart but restoring its energy. Because they were sure of this, their hostility towards him waned. As expected of the undead, they were quick to anger but also quick to calm down.\n[Success! 2% of the Bone Core’s information has been restored.]\n[A resounding success! 3% of the Bone Core’s information has been restored.]\n[Success! ...]\nThe compatibility between the Solar Fossil and the Bone Core was unmatched. When reinforcing a core with a similar core, there would be times when the reinforcement failed, but the Solar Fossils never failed to reinforce the Bone Core.\nPerhaps the Solar Fossil was used in the construction of the Titan Golem Core in the past... In other words, perhaps the sunlight stone was used in its creation. It might not have been part of its core, but rather, part of its body instead.\n[It’s gradually...]\n[The energy in my body is increasing more and more. It might even be similar to the blessing that the Titan bestowed upon all Giants when it was alive...!]\nWhy was their energy increasing as the Bone Core was restored more and more? What exactly was the connection between this core and the Giants? Lee Shin Woo continued to reinforce the Bone Core diligently, if for no other reason than to find out that link.\n[A resounding success! 3% of the Bone Core’s information has been restored.]\n[Success! 2% of the Bone Core’s information has been restored.]\nThe restoration rate of the core had already reached 50%. At this point, the restoration speed slowed down a bit, but the Solar Fossils would always restore it by at least 1%. The Giants were no longer just shocked; they now looked in awe.\n[T-The Titan is...]\n[The human... No, Paul Zero was right. The Titan is... coming back to life...!]\n[Ooh, Ooooh...!]\nThe Giants, who’d stood awkwardly, soon began to bow their heads towards Lee Shin Woo. He thought he’d clear up the ’misunderstanding’, but he hadn’t expected this, so Lee Shin Woo just ended up smiling.\n[A resounding success! The Bone Core’s information has been completely restored.]\nWhen he finally completely restored the Bone Core, the Bone Core stopped drawing in all of the surrounding heat. The once prevalent cold air was instantaneously cleared, and the Giants looked as though they were going to cry.\n[The curse has finally been lifted...!]\n[How preposterous. To think it was a human that did it!]\n[I’m angry. I may be angry, but I guess I have to acknowledge him!] Thıs text ıs hosted at novel⟡fire.net\n[You... You’re our savior. Fennos sent us a savior!]\nLee Shin Woo glanced at the Giants and turned his attention back to the Bone Core. A hero’s eyes could see all, and he mercilessly read the completed Bone Core’s information.\n[Lv8 Titan Golem Bone Core]\n[A golem created by a human who wanted to reach godhood. A Titan’s core. In the past, when the Titan was destroyed, the core’s charge function was damaged and it continuously drew in heat, becoming a defective product. However, it is now at 100% functionality.]\n[The heat is charged at 100%, but because there is only the core left, there is nowhere to release the heat. You must learn the techniques to recreate the golem and procure the necessary materials to make it as well.]\n\"...Ha.\"\nLee Shin Woo read the information and couldn’t help but laugh. He didn’t think that this core, which froze this entire mountain range and even twisted around and hid the space, would cause all of this just because its ’heat charging’ function had been damaged!\n’So the original golem sucked in heat from its surrounding and stored it in the core. Its strength lay in releasing all of that heat.’\nOnce it has reached full capacity, it must stop charging, but because the core’s charge function had been damaged, it couldn’t reach that, and as a result, created this ridiculously icy zone. What a joke!\n\"Kratia would be disappointed if she found out.\"\nKratia thought that the Titan’s Heart was an item that continuously discharged cold air. However, that cold air was just a byproduct of the Titan’s Heart sucking in all the heat in its surroundings, so it would be quite unsatisfying for her.\n’Wait a sec. Now that I think about it, that might not be the case.’\nKratia might actually get excited if she knew that they could make a new type of golem with this. When he considered the fact that they’d be using a level 8 core, they might even be able to create a level 8 golem if all goes well!\n[Who is Kratia...?]\n\"She’s someone who’ll be really helpful in reviving the Titan.\"\n[Oh, Oooh!]\nAt some point, the Giants had begun addressing Lee Shin Woo with honorifics, and Lee Shin Woo accepted it quite naturally. He’d been in so many scenarios where an individual would change their attitude once the situation changed.\n[Can you really... revive the Titan?]\n[If that’s the case, then we’ll be able to regain our original power!]\n[A true Titan’s Pride. With pride that none can challenge!]\nLee Shin Woo grabbed onto the Titan’s Heart, and now that it was fully restored, he realized. The ’Titan’s Pride’ that the Giants spoke of wasn’t simply a belief.\nThey were actually strengthened by the Titan’s Heart, so if he actually restored the golem, then they should undergo an even greater transformation. Now that Lee Shin Woo had had the time to analyze the core, albeit briefly, he roughly understood the reason behind it.\n\"Humans who wanted to become Gods... You’re that group of humans.\"\n[We are Titans... the Titan Tribe.]\n\"Yeah, right. Titans.\"\nIn the past, when Lee Shin Woo had seen the mana that flowed within their bodies, he had concluded that the reason that they had such strength and sturdy constitutions was because of their mana pattern.\nThrough a special way of circulating mana, they would develop their bones, muscles, skin, and blood. Because of that, they didn’t have any magical abilities, but in exchange, they could use mana to reinforce their bodies to such an extent that would allow them to overcome magic.\nHowever, when he thought about it carefully, wasn’t that kind of strange? There was no reason to further enlarge their bodies with mana if they were originally Giants. Rather, it was only natural that they’d create a technique that would harmonize their powerful physical bodies and mana together to exert incredible destructive force.\n’In other words, Titans didn’t start as Titans.’\nIf he assumed that they weren’t Giants from the very beginning, then everything made sense.\nTo reach godhood, they studied mana and applied that research onto humans, as they continuously focused on improving their bodies again and again... The ’Mana Breathing’ ability would spread amongst humans and if it were passed down generation after generation, then... if that’s how their descendants steadily increased in size, then...\n’And what if this Titan Golem is the basis for this Mana Breathing ability?’\nThe Mana Breathing ability was originally created to catch up to the Titan Golem, so the fact that the magic that comes out of the core affects and strengthens the Giants’ own mana shouldn’t be surprising...\n\"Hoo.\"\nLee Shin Woo, who’d thought this far, shook his head. In the end, it was nothing more than a hypothesis. Perhaps these Titans, who were born with Mana Breathing, were based on the Titan Golem, as it was the ideal shape. And then, God would probably give them her blessing as well.\n\"Since all that matters is the result.\"\n[Sir... Paul Zero?]\n\"Listen.\"\nLee Shin Woo curtly ordered the Giants, who’d even added ’sir’ to his name.\n\"We’re going to revive the Titan. Now help us kill Metafel. You can, can’t you?\"\n[Of course we can!]\nThe Giant who’d led him here, as well as his senior heroes, responded energetically.\nAside from these golems, no one had any idea that a single skeleton was attempting to revive a Titan, which had been lost in the annals of history.",

    "content": "<Chapter 32. Titan’s Pride - 5 [End of Volume 7]>\n[The Titan’s strength is being restored!]\n[He who possesses Fenno’s will, Paul Zero, has revived the Titan!]\nThe Giants were in high spirits. Once Lee Shin Woo had come out holding the Titan’s Heart, or the Titan Bone Core, the abilities of all the Giants spread out across their domain had increased. Of course, there was no way to get an exact number, but it seemed like they’d gotten about 20% stronger than before.\n’And if I manage to install the core into a golem... At the very least, they’ll be stronger than they are now.’\nIf he added in the golem’s body, which amplified and refined the core’s energy, then the Giants’ should be strengthened even further. But he regretted just one thing: the golem would possess a natural weakness.\n’It won’t endlessly release heat. However, it will condense heat almost to its very limit and then release it for a limited duration...’\nOf course, because it was set up that way, the core was level 8, but he couldn’t get rid of the feeling that this golem was a weapon of mass destruction. It couldn’t run for very long and it also had a long recharge time, so...\n[We’ll follow Paul Zero’s orders! Become a wild ice storm and push the enemy back!]\n[The returned Titan’s Pride! Let’s show them the strength of the Titans!]\n[Uoooooooh!]\n\"Good. Then, everyone do as they’ve been told! ...This is all I know for now, and I’ll leave the rest to you.\"\n\"Ah.\"\nOnce he ordered the Giants to move out, Lee Shin Woo turned around and passed the core to Kratia. Though the core was indeed fully restored, there was still much they needed to know about it before they could use it to manufacture a golem. And Lee Shin Woo couldn’t find out all there was to know by himself.\n\"Can you really leave it with me?\"\n\"I’m going to be busy commanding them, so I don’t have the time to do a thorough analysis. Plus, you’re the only one who can protect it and analyze it at the same time.\"\n\"...Leave it to me. We’ll make an amazing golem together.\"\nKratia, who momentarily looked on vacantly at Lee Shin Woo’s words, soon snorted, nodded her head, and accepted the core from Lee Shin Woo, along with his trust.\nShe said that ’she could do it’ and he put her in charge of it, but her mission truly was important. She wouldn’t be sitting in one place, leisurely analyzing the core; instead, she would be moving together with Lee Shin Woo, simultaneously analyzing and protecting it so that it would eventually further strengthen the Giants.\nMoreover, if she had the time, she would have to use her magic as well. For anyone else, it would be impossible, but for her, who could use Catalyst Magic through the use of her orb, it became possible.\n\"Do you think we’ll be able to make a golem before we face off against Metafel?\"\n\"That’d be the best outcome, but remember, we came here ready to win without this thing.\"\nLee Shin Woo had given Kratia the core for her to analyze ’just in case’. If Metafel hadn’t had that strange skill that allowed him to call troops to him, Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t have had to prepare for the worst case scenario.\nBut as they say ’even if it’s rotten, it’s still a herring’. Because Metafel had shown what he could do, Lee Shin Woo had to do what he could, and even a bit of what he couldn’t.\n\"But it’s a relief that we were able to obtain the core early on. Since we also gained some great reinforcements in the process.\"\n\"That’s... Yeah, you’re right.\"\nOnce Lee Shin Woo and Kratia got atop his back, Jin ran atop the hill and nodded, seeing the two Giants jumping down from the cliff and into the tail of the enemy forces. Those two Giants were none other than the two elite level 7 Sealed Titan Zombies that had once been heroes, Ellata and Arogan.\n\"Remember, hit and run!\"\n[Of course. Hit...!]\n[Hit!]\nHis High Rank Command skill allowed them to hear him, even from afar, and the two Giants enthusiastically nodded their heads at Lee Shin Woo’s command.\nAlthough they were level 7 elite Giants, if Metafel personally came forward with his subordinates, they would have no chance against him. Therefore, he’d ordered them to adopt hit and run tactics, and they seemed to obey his order without question, befitting Giants who were so loyal to the Titan’s Heart... is what he thought, but they soon betrayed his expectations.\n[Hitttttttt!]\nThe two ’heroes’ both placed their hands into the ground and flipped the ground, crushing hundreds of soldiers underneath. Then, they picked up the unearthed land and threw it, killing the other section of the army. They had instantaneously annihilated the squad.\n[As you’ve commanded, Sir Paul Zero, we’ll withdraw now!]\n[Victory for the great Titan!]\nIt wasn’t even a matter of ’hitting and running’ anymore. With just one much too powerful ’hit’, the Giants had destroyed the entire squad leaving no more enemies to kill, so they just had to go somewhere else!\nThere had to have been a few level 5 knights mixed in, yet they had died without even putting up a fight, causing Lee Shin Woo to just laugh.\n\"They’re quite dependable.\"\nNice. If they kept doing that, then they would be able to lower the enemy force’s numbers faster than he’d anticipated. Even so, Lee Shin Woo ordered that they not be careless. He then gave out his orders to his other troops.\n\"Break that side!\"\n[I understand!]\nThere were other Giants who fought at the forefront other than Ellata and Arogan, but most of them would either break the dangerous mountainous terrain or shake the mountain paths to sew chaos amongst the enemy ranks.\nWith their size, the Giants could easily break a single hill and crush the enemy forces under the rubble or isolate the unit from the main force!\n[Hey... a rock’s coming your way...!]\n[A rock? Wait, it’s a boulder... A boulder!]\n[I-It’s the Giants! The Giants have ambushed us and are throwing boulders at us!]\n[What the hell are you talking about... Kuhahk!?]\n[General!]\nRem kept track of the enemy’s movements, and once Lee Shin Woo had gotten its report, he gave out orders to the appropriate Giants. They were disrupting the army at the right place and the right time, so even Metafel’s ability wouldn’t be able to assemble all of his troops together.\n[Kuhaa. Who are you so desperately looking for?]\n[Keok!?]\n[It’s a monster!]\nAnd it wasn’t the Giants that had arrived here first, but the Paul Corps, as Lee Shin Woo could relay his intent to them much more quickly.\nEspecially Shino Rendu. Perhaps it was because of his Avenger karma, but all of Shino Rendu’s abilities increased exponentially when facing not only Metafel but his subordinates as well. Orıginal content can be found at novel⚑fire.net\n[Kuaaaaaaaaaaah!]\n[Kahk!]\n[Kii...!]\nShino Rendu swung his largely reinforced right arm (with the skill bestowed upon him by God), and created a miracle much like the two Giants. Whenever his giant, reddened arm created a shockwave, the Empire’s troops would be ripped apart and scatter.\nBecause of him, the Empire’s troops faltered, and the Pauls he led merely had to strike at the soldiers and take them down. Actually, around half of them had already died and turned into loot.\n[Paul Zero has given the order. The greater our resolve, the faster the Titan’s resurrection will be!]\n[Uooooooooh! The Titan’s Pride!]\n[The Titan’s Pride!]\n\"Did you say something like that?\"\n\"Yeah, I lied.\"\n\"You’re so cool.\"\nThe Giants from all across the mountain range cried out, and Lee Shin Woo continued to give out orders.\nThey would throw boulders, break cliffs, break roads, and even break snowbanks that had accumulated for years and drop them onto the Imperial Army. It was shiver-inducing, as it was so much like mother nature’s fury.\n[Now is the time! While they’re floundering around, let’s give them a spear to the face!]\n[For Paul Zero!]\n[Carrying out Master’s command.]\nIt wasn’t just Shino Rendu attacking the confused Imperial Army, it was also Bisher Moon, Chi Paul, and even the Erems as well launching a surprise attack, so Lee Shin Woo was actually able to see the number of enemy forces dwindle.\nIt was like they were eating cheese, starting from the outside little by little. By repeatedly dividing and isolating their troops, Lee Shin Woo’s troops were quickly able to cut down their numbers. Perhaps they were even cutting them down faster than the first day. Also, the Giants’ fighting ability had increased significantly and their attitudes had changed as well.\n[I’ll kill you... for the Titan’s Pride!]\n[For Paul Zero!]\n[Dear Titan, please watch over me!]\nIt was different from yesterday where they had to fight out of necessity. They trusted and had hope that the Titan would return, so they fought as though there were something waiting for them beyond death. There was no way they wouldn’t have gotten stronger.\n[Metafel... I’ll kill you myself!]\n[These abhorrent traces of the Empire... Let’s bury them into the cold earth!]\n[Uooooooooooh!]\nOf course, the Paul Zero Corps had absorbed 13,000 bones in a single day, so they had become significantly stronger. Moreover, the level 7 elite bone that Chi Paul had absorbed had a greater effect on it than he’d expected, so the Paul Zero Corps were determined to get stronger and were being more active in the fight than before.\n\"Good. They’ve killed about 10,000 of them.\"\nLee Shin Woo figured out how many they’d killed through Rem, nodded his head, and muttered. Jin was astonished and yelled.\n\"Already!? It hasn’t even been two hours since the battle began...!\"\n\"We have to take them down even quicker. After all, I don’t know how long we’ll be able to maintain our advantage.\"\n\"But couldn’t you just take your elites and fight Metafel directly? If you take down the leader, then they’ll fall apart and run away. Isn’t that your usual plan?\"\n\"No way. We can’t.\"\nLee Shin Woo firmly replied to Jin’s question. Of course, if he had an ability that could one shot the leader and sew chaos amongst the enemy ranks all in one then he would do so, but...\n\"For this guy, we need to take out all the guys around him first.\"\n\"I agree. ...Since our opponent’s a Ghoul.\"\nEven though he was constantly giving his subordinates orders, Lee Shin Woo didn’t take his eyes off of Metafel Rerdan, who was in the very center of his troops. He had judged Metafel as that much of a threat.\nDespite his soldiers dying all around him, Metafel didn’t hurry and his eyes shined, surveying the battlefield around him. Then, as ordered, Setoin (he looked like his aide-de-camp) shot an arrow at someone who had been in the rear, killing them.\n\"...He’s looking for me.\"\n\"There are two hills between us, so do you think he’ll be able to find us?\"\n\"He’ll never be able to find us. They don’t know about Rem, so they’re still trying to find us. If only they knew... Too bad.\"\nBut right as Lee Shin Woo finished, Setoin immediately shot an arrow into the sky. Metafel and Setoin, who’d felt that it was odd that Lee Shin Woo was able to both command his troops and track their movements from afar, had soon come to the right conclusion. Moreover, they had quickly figured out exactly where Rem was and even hit it! Setoin definitely had some kind of sniping skill.\n[Master, I’ve sustained damage.]\n\"Return. That guy’s a pain in the ass.\"\n[I understand.]\nHe knew that he’d eventually be exposed as the battle went on, but it was much too soon. Lee Shin Woo recalled Rem, who’d been struck by Setoin’s arrow, healed it, and clicked his tongue.\n\"The situation’s changed. It’s become unclear as to whether we can deal with Metafel quicker or not.\"\n\"What about firing a huge spell at them and then putting Rem back into the air?\"\n\"We can’t use Rem anymore. However, firing a huge spell; that sounds like a good idea. ...It seems like Setoin is moving to take down the Giants. Break that cliff over there. With that, we’ll be able to hold him back. ...I think we should start attacking their command now.\"\n\"Ok.\"\nKratia briefly passed the core to Lee Shin Woo and began casting her spell. But when Rem, who had been fully healed, was about to jump onto Lee Shin Woo’s shoulder, it stopped and focused on the core.\n[May I help with the analysis of the course as well?]\n\"Ah, now that I think about it, golems are your specialty. Can I leave it to you?]\n[Of course.]\nTo think that it’d be the best of helpful, regardless of whether it was in the sky or on the ground. What a lovable golem. Lee Shin Woo thought about what he should reward Rem with once this battle ends, and continued to order his undead. But then...\n\"Shin Woo!\"\nKratia sharply called for Lee Shin Woo. Lee Shin Woo raised his head, he witnessed Kratia’s spell causing a huge explosion and saw her use the cliff to attack Metafel and Setoin in particular. Using her Catalyst Magic, she transformed the crumbled icy hill into hundreds of thousands of ice spears, which was especially memorable.\n\"What’s this? It’s perfect.\"\n\"That’s not the problem here! That guy! The moment I cast the spell, he figured out where we are!\"\n\"...He’s pretty good. Was Hansen the only half-wit amongst the 12 generals?\"\nWas it because Kratia’s magic was so large in scale? He was able to see Metafel from beyond the broken cliff. The problem was that Metafel had found them when Kratia had activated the spell...\n[Keuk, Kuhaaaaaaaa!]\nRight after he’d ascertained their location, he screamed bizarrely. If Lee Shin Woo still had eardrums, then it felt like they would’ve burst. It was as though that scream was warning them that he’d find them, and Lee Shin Woo decided to take him on, matching him with his Instigate.\n[Kuhaaaaaaaa... Kuwaaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\nMetafel, who’d been screaming, suddenly opened his mouth wide.\nAnd ate the nearest knight.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 33 part1",
    "content": "<Chapter 33. Titan - 1>\nIf there was one thing Lee Shin Woo hadn’t taken into account, it was Metafel’s, or the one once hailed as the Mercenary King’s ’pride’.\n[Kik, so there wasn’t someone behind me... No, they may still be there, but that guy’s the leader! K-kiiik! How funny! Kuheeeeehk!]\nMetafel must’ve thought that he was just some unknown spy, but what would he think if he knew that Lee Shin Woo was actually the mastermind behind all of this?\nNot only had he lost the artifact that the Archmage had given him, but it’d also been used against him to divide his troops. What if these Giants and the undead, who had gradually cut down his troops by half, were on the same side?\n[Kiiiiiiiik! The Mercenary King, Metafel is gone. Completely gone! Yeah, it’s been a long time since my rotten brain has been eaten away, so how could I be the same as before!?]\nThe moment Metafel was able to see the man who had cleverly led him here, used his pride against him so that he wouldn’t call for reinforcements, who commanded the undead, humans, Giants, even golems and other races as well, had trapped his forces inside the mountain range, and had cajoled them...\n[Kukeuk. Kuheuk... Kuaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\nHe charged forward as if he were going to do that from the very beginning. When he thought about his proud 50,000 troops being taken down by that man, he knew he couldn’t just sit around like an idiot and do nothing.\n[You don’t need a corps anymore.]\n[You want me to take the Lightning Shadow General’s place? Archmage, I am the Mercenary King. I am strongest when I lead.]\n[No, you still don’t understand, do you? That was all in the past. You’re different now.]\nThat was a part of the conversation that they’d had after the Lightning Shadow General’s death.\nAt the time, Metafel hadn’t understood what the Archmage was telling him, and so, the Archmage gave him a mission. That mission was to invade the Giant’s domain.\n[Kik...]\nBack then, he thought that by killing all of the Giants and eating all their rotten flesh and blood that he’d be able to level up. However, that didn’t actually happen.\nNumbers were meaningless due to the perilous terrain, and his opponents were stronger than he’d anticipated. His squads would clash with a small handful of troops and would repeatedly be ripped apart over and over again. Now, Metafel understood what the Archmage was trying to tell him.\n[Weaklings... are unnecessary! Kuaaaaaah!]\nA single absolute being held no weaknesses. Metafel had a way to become the ’absolute strongest’, and all he needed to do was make up his mind. It was too much of a waste to just use his ability to heal his wounds. The ability that came with his ’rebirth’ wasn’t something as trivial as a healing ability.\n[G-General...!]\n[Delicious! As I thought, it’s delicious!]\nHe would become stronger and grow through eating, and ultimately, evolve. Metafel shuddered. It felt like that once unbreakable wall was cracking bit by bit and light was shining through. The more he stretched out his hand, the wider he opened his mouth, the more intense that light became.\n[All of you... come to me! I will... eat all of you!]\nAnd thus began Metafel’s feast of his troops.\n\"That crazy bastard is...\"\nSeeing that, Lee Shin Woo shuddered for a different reason.\nMetafel’s soldiers were dwindling rather quickly. Through the efforts of the Giants and Pauls, around half of Metafel’s soldiers had been defeated, and Metafel began to eat the other half.\n[General, why...!?]\n[Geureu...! There’s no reason for you to live when you couldn’t even take down one enemy. Be thankful that you can at least become a source of nutrients for me!]\n[Guaaaaahk!?]\nThe crazed Metafel began to eat without considering the soldiers around him watching. Although Metafel looked exactly like a human at first, when he opened his mouth and his jaw stretched, his cheeks ripped open, revealing sharp beast-like teeth within.\n\"That crazy Ghoul bastard!\"\n\"I-I’m scared. He’s getting stronger.\"\n\"Shin Woo, what are you going to do?\"\nLee Shin Woo briefly thought about the unforeseen situation ahead of him. Should we take him down immediately, or should he just proceed with his original strategy? But he really didn’t even need to think about it.\n[Kuhaaaaaaaaaaah!]\n\"Keuk!?\"\nThe moment Metafel roared, a red aura surrounded the soldiers that were once under his command. Lee Shin Woo thought it was some sort of special buff skill that Metafel could only use by eating a few of his troops, so he felt really uneasy and recalled his forces, but...\n[Kuaaaaaaah!]\n[Kik, Kihiiiiiii!]\n\"...What the hell?\"\nIt wasn’t actually a buff; it was actually a skill that forced his subordinates to do something... to run towards their commander, Metafel.\n[I-I don’t want to!]\n[Sir Metafel, please don’t!]\n[It’s better if you give your lives to me than to those insects! I’ll eat you all!]\nLee Shin Woo suddenly realized as he watched Metafel open his mouth wide and continue eating. That was the cheat skill that allowed him to ignore the mana’s spatial inference and gather his troops with him at its center! A skill that allowed him to have an emergency food supply nearby at all times!\n\"So why is he doing that now!?\"\n[Master, you won’t be able to win once he’s really started eating! When he’s done eating all of those elites, he might...!]\n\"Yeah. Since he’s almost grown as much he could as a level 7.\"\nShino Rendu had sent him an urgent report, but Lee Shin Woo was already aware of the situation. Lee Shin Woo didn’t know why that crazy bastard began to eat his own soldiers once he caught sight of him, but the number of soldiers wouldn’t matter if he became level 8.\nEven so, even if they attacked, all of his injuries would be healed because he was continuously eating. And despite Kratia’s spell, Setoin had survived and almost as if expecting that this would happen, was standing by Metafel’s side to protect him!\n\"Above all, it’s impossible to take him down, as the Empire’s troops are swarming him from all over. Then, instead... we’ll stop him from eating! All forces, attack! They’re nothing more than target practice right now!\"\nLee Shin Woo’s booming voice resounded throughout the mountain range. If they couldn’t stop Metafel from eating, then they would remove his food supply. That was the only thing Lee Shin Woo could do at this point. Read full story at novèlfire.net\nBecause of his skill, Metafel’s subordinates couldn’t do anything but rush towards him. Therefore, he wouldn’t have to worry about any casualties and his forces could just take them down with ease!\n[Guoooooooooooooh!]\n[Kyahaaaaaaah!]\n[For the Titan’s Pride!]\nAll who heard his call discarded their covert operations and charged out from the canyons, above the hills, and between the boulders.\nMetafel continued to eat his own troops, and those troops were forced to focus on Metafel. The Paul Corps and the Giants charged at the enemy troops... and it was chaos.\n\"How did it come to this?\"\n\"Don’t ask me.\"\nIt tasted bitter. Of course, he hadn’t expected that it would go his way from start to finish, but who could’ve known that Metafel would have that trick up his sleeve?\nMoreover, Metafel was situated in an unfavorable location. By breaking the entire cliff with her arcane magic, Kratia had managed to inflict a significant amount of damage onto the main force, but she had simultaneously turned the landscape into an open snowy plain, which made it difficult for them to further attack him.\n\"So it’s a total war, huh.\"\n\"You can’t call this a total war. ...If you really have to call it something, then call it a dining room...\"\n\"It’s the most intense dining room I’ve ever seen...\"\n\"Stop as many of them as you can! We’re going too!\"\nThe crazed Metafel didn’t discriminate between friend and foe and just continued to eat in order to reach level 8. On the other hand, the Paul Corps attacked the clamoring troops, who were stuck to the general, allowing them to rest in peace. A battle really shouldn’t have changed this much in such a short period of time.\n’However, if we exclude the fact that Metafel is continuously getting stronger, then the situation’s not bad.’\nLee Shin Woo drew swords with both hands, pointed Jin to the enemy forces, and Jin began to run. The reason Lee Shin Woo had so adamantly decided to use the Giants to break the cliffs and spread poison was because of the absolute numerical disadvantage.\nHowever, right now, Metafel himself was cutting down his own troops. Moreover, Metafel’s troops couldn’t put up a proper fight because of his skill, so if he took advantage of this situation, then he should be able to kill Metafel fairly easily.\n’That’s the key.’\n\"Whether Metafel reaches level 8 or not.\"\nLee Shin Woo muttered while summoning a gigantified Melting Double Bone Axe in the air, exploding it, and spreading the Acid Poison amongst thousands of enemy troops. Hearing that, Jin slightly shook.\n\"What do we do if he really becomes level 8? Do we do what we did against Feotane Von Seldin...?\"\n\"No. He won’t be that strong. Since that guy seemed really powerful, even for a level 8. ...But he’ll definitely be strong. Moreover, if we take into account his innate ability as a ghoul, then taking him on with numbers is a really bad idea.\"\nTo be honest, he didn’t even want to imagine a foe like a level 8 Ghoul. If Metafel were to eat one of his troops while fighting, not only would his wounds heal, but he would become stronger as well, so no matter how many level 7 elites he had, Lee Shin Woo couldn’t help but feel reluctant.\n\"Plus, I thought he wouldn’t eat the skeletons, but he actually is. I hope he breaks his teeth from chewing on the bones.\"\n\"Shin Woo, get a hold of yourself. If you lose focus, then we’ll all die... Tch!\"\nJin called for Lee Shin Woo, who was acting like a toddler before the general and suddenly leaped into the air. He had barely avoided the black arrow that flew past his feet; it was shot by none other than Setoin Miletus. At some point, he had gotten in front of them, blocking their way.\n[It felt like it’d take way too long to take down the Giants or the golems.]\nContrary to the Empire’s troops, which continuously swarmed Metafel, Setoin was surprisingly able to retain his intellect. Of course, he was likewise clad in a red aura, but his indomitable will to protect Metafel allowed him to resist its effects.\nHe was truly a faithful subject... He was also a true pain in the ass for Lee Shin Woo.\n[Come. You’re not planning on running away again, are you?]\n\"Of course not. If we can take you down, then it’ll definitely weaken him.\"\nLee Shin Woo looked at Setoin, who confidently aimed his bow at him, and replied calmly, but he was actually quite frustrated. It was because of Kratia, who was sitting behind him.\nImmediately after she had used her arcane magic, Kratia had become dead weight. Moreover, his opponent used a bow. It would be quite difficult to take him on while protecting Kratia.\n\"Because I have things to do, I won’t be able to play with you for very long!\"\n[Keuk!]\nIf that’s the case, then he had no choice but to kill his opponent as quickly as possible! Lee Shin Woo linked his mind with Jin and they suddenly charged forward at Setoin.\nSetoin, as though he had expected this, shot out dozens of arrows (it must have been a skill), but a shield suddenly appeared right in front of him that blocked the arrows and blew up, inflicting damage upon him.\n[Kuhahk!?]\n\"Know your place!\"\nTo be honest, Lee Shin Woo didn’t like Setoin right from the beginning. Setoin always guarded Metafel by his side and carefully planned for him. Lee Shin Woo had stolen the magical device and despite him being just an aide-de-camp, Setoin had the gall to look down on Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Thanks for coming over here yourself!\"\n[Keook!]\nThere was a Breath of the Lightning God stuck in Setoin’s neck, who had rolled onto the floor and attempted to stand. Lee Shin Woo pushed the blade all the way into the ground, preventing Setoin from moving. Jin forcefully kicked with his front legs and broke his bow to pieces.\n\"You’re really fast...\"\nAlthough Setoin was a level 7 like Lee Shin Woo, as well as an elite, their fight had concluded instantaneously. Kratia, who had taken a defensive posture, marveled at Lee Shin Woo, as he had overpowered Setoin in an instant, while she hadn’t even been able to react. If he’s this powerful, then he should be able to fight Metafel head on...\n\"Jin!\"\n\"Keuk!\"\nJin pulled back again. A wave of red, dreary mana struck the ground where they once were. There was only one thing that would cause Lee Shin Woo and Jin to evade: Metafel himself.\n[You’re trying to steal Setoin away from me as well? We can’t have that.]\n\"Ha!\"\nThe moment Metafel touched the Breath of the Lightning God, Lee Shin Woo forcefully exploded it.\nLee Shin Woo planned to either injure Metafel or finish Setoin off, but... Unfortunately, Metafel stretched out his arms and a hideous tongue grabbed onto the exploding Breath of the Lightning God and ate it.\nImmediately after, the Breath of the Lightning God exploded with a ’boom’, blowing up his arms, but he regenerated the arms immediately with his overwhelming regenerative abilities.\n\"...What?\"\n[General!]\n[Setoin, good work.]\n[Yes, General...]\nLee Shin Woo groaned at Metafel’s durability, as he was able to withstand an explosion of a Breath of the Lightning God unscathed. Metafel then grabbed the toppled Setoin and ate him.\nHe swallowed him down and red mana exploded from his body.\n[I think... I’m nearly there.]\nMetafel, who’d finished eating Setoin, turned to Lee Shin Woo and grinned.\nHis body was lined with cracks, but then, his body swelled as if it were exploding.\n[Wait right there. I’ll eat you in just a little bit!]\nLee Shin Woo couldn’t even recognize Metafel anymore, and Metafel cried out as waves of mana were emitted from his body.\nHe had a hunch. Metafel had begun to level up.",

    "content": "<Chapter 33. Titan - 2>\nLee Shin Woo knew that the choices he’d made had culminated into the situation at hand. He was also well aware that sometimes, instinct trumped sound logic.\n[Lv8 Eater Metafel Rerdan]\n[Currently being bestowed a new karma whilst evolving to level 8. The nature of that karma is ’eating’, so he can easily eat anything that interferes with the evolution process. Approaching is dangerous.]\n[Your opponent cannot move for the next ten minutes.]\nHis intuition was telling him that fighting Metafel right now would be really stupid.\n\"All forces, listen up!\"\n[Paul Zero!]\n[I await your orders, Master.]\nAside from Metafel, whose flesh was expanding and was exposing his teeth in the middle of his evolution, ’everyone’ stopped from Lee Shin Woo’s booming voice.\nThere were some who had sensed Metafel’s evolution, stopped cutting down the enemy forces, and backed off, while there were also those who hadn’t noticed Metafel’s evolution and continued to charge.\n[Y-Your voice woke me up.]\n[What exactly was I doing...]\n[Is that really Sir Metafel?]\n[Shut your mouth this instant! The Mercenary King I serve is nothing like that!]\nWhat’s worse, Lee Shin Woo’s shout had affected Metafel’s troops as well. Though they had originally been under the effects of Metafel’s absolute command skill, the circumstances of the current situation were quite unique, so they were released from the skill’s effects.\nIf they saw Metafel now, then they wouldn’t feel loyalty, they would feel sorrowful love, or perhaps nothing at all.\n\"We’re retreating to the Giants’ domain now. The battle’s over!\"\nLee Shin Woo declared to no one in particular. He didn’t think he’d relay his orders through such a terrible method, but even so, they needed to get out of here.\n[The battle’s over, you say...]\n\"The only thing left is my battle with him. You guys, collect all the bones and retreat from the battlefield. Right away! Hurry up!\"\n[U-Understood!]\nNo one hesitated over his orders. The battle of armies fighting against one another was over. Now all that was left was Metafel, who had eaten about 20,000 soldiers, and the thousands of remaining enemy troops that watched on stunned. There was no way they could fight anymore.\n[Paul Zero, the Titan...!]\n\"You guys retreat too. If he eats the Titan’s Heart, then I won’t be able to save you!\"\n[U-Understood!]\n\"The loot! Don’t miss a single piece of Perium! Don’t leave a single thing for him!\"\nThe enemy troops had dropped a considerable amount of Perium and bones. If Metafel was able to eat even those, then there was a chance that he would become so strong that Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t be able to handle him. Looking at Metafel now, it seemed like he would be perfectly capable of eating them.\n’Would mana attacks work on him in that state?’\nIn order to test this theory, Lee Shin Woo liberally infused the Breath of the Lightning God with lightning and shot it at him, but Metafel just ate it up. Even though it exploded, Metafel absorbed the resulting energy, so he couldn’t do anything while Metafel was evolving. He tried shooting fire, ice, and acid to check, but they were all the same.\n’...He won’t be like that after his evolution. At least, I have to hope for that.’\nThis was what resulted from translating the word ’eater’ into karma. It made sense that Metafel’s form had changed and he had become such a fearsome monster.\nLee Shin Woo shook as he saw cracks form on Metafel’s fat body, and in between those cracks, rotten tongues and teeth burst out. He was much happier being a skeleton, thank you very much.\n\"Shin Woo, there’s something I’ll do for you before I leave.\"\n\"That guy can eat any and all magic right now, so what do you intend to do?\"\n\"Even so, I feel like I can slow down his evolution. I think I can slow it by a few hours!\"\nKratia was likewise desperate. Lee Shin Woo saw her assimilate her orb and begin an incantation for a spell. Then, he looked at the enemy forces... to be exact, the remaining 6,700 troops of the Imperial Army. Lee Shin Woo’s black goblin fire calmly looked them over... and the flames swayed as if he were feeling bitter.\n\"Are you guys just going to sit there?\"\n[We’re still fighting. Don’t listen to him!]\n[H-However, right now...]\nThey were well aware that the only reason they had survived was because Metafel had begun his evolution before he could finish eating them all. When he was finished evolving, he would come to finish the job.\n\"Why are you hesitating?\"\n[We are...]\n[What should we do...?]\n\"At the very least, I’m sure that if you stay there, Metafel will eat you all.\"\n[...]\nIt seemed as though the two level 7 Corps Commanders couldn’t run away and were already eaten by Metafel, but there were still some level 6 elites remaining. There were a significant number of level 5s and level 4s as well. However, they were all flustered, as they didn’t know what to do in their current situation.\nLee Shin Woo could understand how they felt. He even felt sorry for them. It was quite tragic to see their loyalty, which extended even after death, resulting in something like this. Thɪs chapter is updatᴇd by NoveI-Fire.ɴet\n\"Your only mistake was following the wrong person. The Empire sent you guys here so that you could be food for him. You were used. It would’ve been better if you had been used as chess pieces, but instead, you were used as food. How pitiful.\"\n[How can that be!?]\n[Don’t you dare insult His Majesty!]\n[The Empire wouldn’t abandon us...]\nLee Shin Woo lied, but this time, he turned out to be right. The voices of those who refuted his claims were weak. Then again, it made sense; how could they stay strong when their general who lead them thus far began to eat them?\n\"I’ll give you a chance. It’s your last chance to choose your own destiny. ...Follow me.\"\n[...]\nLee Shin Woo’s voice resounded, reaching the remains of the Imperial Army. He wondered whether it would work or not, but now that their connection with their general had been cut, he felt like he had a chance.\n\"The situation’s quite urgent, so I’ll get to the point. ...I won’t betray you. I’ll turn you into warriors. I’ll help you so that you can one day take revenge against those who betrayed you.\"\n[The ones...]\n[Who betrayed us...]\n\"My name is Paul Zero. The one who will bring the Empire to its knees. All those who have been betrayed by the Empire, follow me!\"\nAt that moment, a soldier in the center of the Imperial Army, who had quietly listened to Lee Shin Woo’s speech, began to glow. Lee Shin Woo felt a single strand of his darkness mana form a connection with it.\nIt was the level 6 elite, Skeleton Knight Leader. No, now it was different.\n[Lv6 Dark Knight Leader (Elite)]\nOnce Lee Shin Woo had made his offer and the Skeleton Knight Leader had accepted, a master-servant relationship was formed, and his darkness magic affected the skeleton, surprisingly creating an existence that had been slightly released from the Empire’s curse... turning it into an undead similar to the Pauls!\n[My head is... I feel like my head has gotten clearer. Alright, I will follow your orders. Rather than become food, I’d rather take my revenge on the Empire who put me in this position.]\nHe pushed his way through the nearby idiots and bowed his head before Lee Shin Woo. Jin didn’t think Lee Shin Woo would profit off this disastrous situation where their enemy was leveling up and just looked at Lee Shin Woo, speechless. Lee Shin Woo completely ignored his gaze and replied to the knight.\n\"Alright. I’ll give you the name Paul 1,000.\"\n[It’s an honor.]\nLee Shin Woo probably hadn’t expected that it would come to his side, as the undead had been part of the Imperial Army just a little while ago. Lee Shin Woo’s power alone hadn’t been enough to release the curse previously, as its roots had grown too deep.\nHowever, it was different now. He knew about his darkness magic now and used it quite actively, so he pulled out the roots of the curse from the undead that had ’responded positively’ to him. And in its place, filled that vacant area with his darkness magic.\n’Cut the unnatural connection. No, I’ll cover it all and make it into pure darkness...’\nWith just that, Lee Shin Woo was able to preserve most of the Knight Leader’s intellect, memories, and will that had been buried underneath the surface. This had all become possible because of Lee Shin Woo’s unlocked darkness magic. This had once again proved to him that his darkness magic was special.\n\"You’re my subordinate now. Together, we’ll take revenge on and purify this twisted Underground Empire.\"\n[Understood.]\n[Wait a sec... M-Me too!]\n[Me too!]\nOnce it had begun, it couldn’t be stopped. Everywhere, light surged, and the elites became even more powerful elites, while those who weren’t elites before became elites. Even the common soldiers became elites.\nLee Shin Woo was astonished at how rapidly his darkness mana was being drained, so he absorbed the ambient mana to replenish his reserves and looked back at Kratia. He had only planned on taking a few of them with him, but if he wasted too much time, then he would have to fight against Metafel soon!\n\"Kratia, can you really stop him?\"\n\"Sorry you had to wait for so long. Now!\"\nKratia, who’d concentrated all of her magic in one place, finished casting her spell and stretched out both her hands. At that moment, a considerable amount of cold air erupted from her hands and continuously expanded, enclosing Metafel’s body. Soon, it looked as though Metafel had been encased in a coffin.\n[Gu...Kuaaah...?]\nThe moment Metafel, whose body and energy had swelled, became trapped in that ice coffin, he flinched for the very first time. His evolution had been slowed!\n\"The more energy he absorbs, the slower his mana becomes. It’s something I came up with by studying the Bone Core.\"\n\"Nice job. You’re the best!\"\nSo even if they both study the same Bone Core, one of them would come up with a new spell! Lee Shin Woo was in awe, but Kratia just shook her head. It looked like she was going to cry.\n\"It’s still not perfect. Obviously, it won’t last very long. And I even used such precious magic materials...\"\n\"You did enough. You bought us enough time to retreat with these guys and reorganize our ranks.\"\nLee Shin Woo turned around confidently. Once he’d named the Dark Knight Leader, or Paul 1,000, the number of troops that decided to follow him increased exponentially.\nA little less than half of the enemy troops had decided to follow him, numbering around 3,000. Since all of the troops who were level 5 and over had decided to follow him, he actually gained about 80% of their combat force.\n[Please tell us what we have to do from now on!]\n\"Alright. This is your first order.\"\nLee Shin Woo looked at the remaining 3,700 soldiers of the Imperial Army he hadn’t been able to convert due to his weakness and spoke firmly.\n\"They are your enemies now, so kill them and collect the loot. Kill them quickly, so we have enough time to escape before Metafel awakens.\"\n\"You devil! Demon!\"\n[I understand!]\nTo an outsider, Lee Shin Woo’s order may seem cruel. However, his resolute order made his converted soldiers feel that he was trustworthy.\n[Kuhahk!]\n[Sir Metafel...!]\nHis converted troops turned towards the foolish, hesitating weaklings and cut them down. Their only path of retreat contained Metafel, who was wriggling around in his icy coffin, so they didn’t have anywhere to go.\n\"Good. If you’ve finished collecting the loot, then let’s go!\"\n[Understood!]\nLee Shin Woo had suddenly gained a force 3,000 strong, and if you included the Dark Knights and Dark Soldiers as well, he now had a new force of 5,000. He then hurriedly led his forces back to the Giants’ domain. He had finished up the battle and run away perfectly, to the point that the other 12 generals should come to watch and learn.\n[Ku....aaaaaaaaah...!]\nThree hours later, the level 8 Eater, Metafel Rerdan broke free of Kratia’s icy coffin and began to move. His evolution had caused all rational thought to cease. He simply longed for more magic, and more delicious bodies now. Metafel had become a walking disaster.\nWhat was Lee Shin Woo doing, you ask?\n[Master, analysis of the core is complete.]\n\"Good... Then, shall we begin manufacturing?\"\nHe was building a weapon of mass destruction.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 33 part3",
    "content": "<Chapter 33. Titan - 3>\nTheir reason for manufacturing a golem was simple. When they thought about how they could take down Metafel, who had evolved into a level 8 Eater, they naturally came to the conclusion that they needed to create ’something so strong that Metafel wouldn’t be able to beat it’. But when it came down to it, their only option was to use the golem core.\nAlthough the core was defective, as it could only discharge energy for a few minutes, it didn’t change the fact that it was a level 8 item.\n\"Are you really done analyzing it? Can we really make a golem out of it?\"\n[I have found out everything that I could. You should be able to create a golem, Master.]\n\"...Alright, then let’s bet it all on the golem.\"\nBut before they began manufacturing the golem, Rem taught them why they hadn’t been able to analyze the core fully.\n[This core cannot be placed in an artificial container. It will not activate. It lacks the ability to receive orders from an outside source and act upon them. The only function it does have is to increase a golem’s abilities.]\n\"...Huh?\"\n\"Aren’t cores designed to allow someone to control them?\"\n\"Did I damage a key function when I turned it into bone? No, there’s no way.\"\nAt this point, the two were halfway panicking and began interrogating Rem. However, Rem corrected their very basic misunderstanding.\n[This core was created quite differently from the Empire’s... or more specifically, Arema Steelworker’s golem manufacturing technique. If not for you bestowing me with a unique authority, which allows me to have a deep understanding of ’all golems’, rather than just a specific type of golem, then I would not have been able to figure it out, Master.]\n\"I gave you that ability, huh. I don’t even remember giving you that ability...\"\n\"The only horse here is Jin, Kek!\" [1]\nKratia made such a lame joke, despite there being no time to waste, causing Jin to kick her with his hind legs. Lee Shin Woo ignored their little spat and Rem continued with its analysis.\n[Of course, I wasn’t able to find out everything myself, but I was able to figure out its functionality. This core stores an overwhelming amount of heat, and for a moment, explodes and circulates it in a unique pattern. This is the way the heat circulates.]\nRem extended its sharp beak and drew as if carving onto the ground. That drawing included the protective layer that covered the core, or in other words, the golem’s main body. But once Lee Shin Woo saw the circulating heat that flowed through its body, which originated from the golem core, he instinctively exclaimed.\n\"This... it’s the same mana pattern that flows through the Giants!\"\n[That’s correct. The circulation of this explosive heat greatly increases the size of the body. As a result, it will increase one’s size to that of a Giants, while also increasing their strength significantly.]\n\"...Hmm, I see.\"\nFor years, the Giants had used a special pattern to circulate their interior mana to increase the size of their bodies. However, that wasn’t actually suitable for the living Giants; instead, it was the mana circulation pattern applied to a golem’s body.\nIn other words, the golem’s body was akin to a drawn magic circle, with the heat released by the core as its fuel. Obviously, this magic circle was most effective when the core was spewing out heat, not when used with a Giant’s mana. This was also the reason that the core strengthened nearby Giants.\n\"So that’s how it works. It was originally designed for a large golem. This mana pattern would allow a golem to temporarily become a Titan and is the peak of magic engineering...\"\n\"If that’s the case, then perhaps the Giants engraved the mana patterns into their bodies so that they wouldn’t trouble the Titans when they repaired the golem.\"\n\"No, they probably just wanted to become as large as the Titans.\"\nThose Giants were anxiously awaiting the Titan’s resurrection, were repeatedly bowing their heads from a distance, and were furtively taking glances at them. Considering the fact that they didn’t even react to Kratia, who was a living being, it was clear how much faith they had in the Titan.\n\"Then what about the golem’s ego? How does the gigantified golem move?\"\n[The core’s remaining function should explain that.]\nRem drew an oval-shaped object in the center of the golem, slightly larger than the core and situated in a similar location. When compared to the size of the core, it seemed like the size that a human being could easily go in and out through.\nHowever, that was just the start. Rem ignored the core and the oval-shaped object for now and drew several lines that originated from the oval-shaped object, which traveled throughout the golem. It was as if Rem was drawing blood vessels. The core and this oval-shaped object seemed to be the heart of the golem. This was...\n\"Huh? Hey wait, is this...\"\n[That’s correct.]\nAnyone would’ve noticed by now, even if they weren’t Lee Shin Woo. Rem retained its calm tone and continued speaking.\n[The core gigantifies the golem’s body, and the golem’s body is used as a medium to synchronize the core with the user.]\n\"...\"\n[Synchronization doesn’t simply mean that your movements are synchronized. The heat that’s quickly circulating through the golem’s body amplifies the user’s mana as well and spreads that mana throughout the golem’s body. In other words, while the core is active, the user essentially becomes a gigantic golem.]\n\"...Ha.\"\nHe was quite familiar with this. Of course, the operating principle was different from start to finish, but Lee Shin Woo was quite familiar with the end result.\nTo think he’d be able to become a giant hero! Becoming incredibly strong for a limited duration... that was exactly like Ultraman!\n\"This is the first time I’ve thought that it was great that I came to this world.\"\n\"Shin Woo, you look really excited.\"\n\"No, I’m not. I’m really serious. It looks like there’s no way to fight that level 8 monster and come out of this unscathed other than to make this golem. So let’s make it right away.\"\n\"But you can’t make this with just anything, right?\"\n\"Well, that goes without saying.\"\nThe core’s explosive heat and the mana circulation technique together allow the golem’s main body to gigantify instantaneously. However, if the materials themselves can’t withstand that immense heat and magic, then they wouldn’t be able to make the golem in the first place.\n\"Do you know what this golem was made of in the past?\"\n[I’m not too sure. However, if we look at the condition of the outer body once it has finished releasing its heat, then we can figure out what materials we need for its construction.]\nRem drew another drawing. It looked just like the core, but the outer body covering it was... Mm... was incredibly small. This would be exaggerating a bit, but it was like it was being wrapped in cellophane.\n[The golem’s main body must consist of materials that have been compressed to the very limit. That way, the moment the heat is released, the user’s entire body will be covered while synchronizing with the golem, and immediately after, the golem will expand. It was probably designed to fit a human.]\n\"Compressed to its very limit...\"\n[However, there’s an even more stringent condition: the endlessly released heat. The core, which has completely expelled all its heat, must absorb a huge quantity of heat over an extremely long period of time. Obviously, the main body also absorbs some of the core’s heat. Normal materials would break at this stage from the core’s heat.]\n\"Of course, since it’s releasing an extreme heat, the golem’s body has to endure that heat as well.\"\nRem nodded its tiny bird head.\n[That’s correct. Therefore, if I were to guess which material would best work, then...\"\n\"The sunlight stone.\"\n[Indeed. However, I believe it would be impossible with just a normal sunlight stone or a Solar Fossil. They are not durable enough nor do they have the required level of heat. Plus, they will not survive the processing required to use as materials for the main body.]\nHe wondered, did they have a way to compress the sunlight stone to the very limit and process it for use on the main body in the past? Perhaps they possessed a material that was even greater than the sunlight stone; it may have been bestowed upon them by God herself.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo’s party didn’t have anything of the sort. He had no choice but to go with what he had. Plus, they needed to do it as quickly as possible, before the Eater broke free of his spatial prison.\n\"Rem, can you and Kratia map out the main body? If we want to go from this candy paper like golem to a truly imposing golem, then we’ll need a thorough mana plan.\"\n[Of course.]\n\"I’ll try my best.\"\n\"Good, then I’ll...\"\nLee Shin Woo took out all of his Solar Fossils from his inventory. He hectically fed the Solar Fossils to the core and despite it being fully functional now, he still had one hundred Solar Fossils left. And more importantly, he still had the Solar Fossil that came from the giant sunlight stone that illuminated the Kadinan facility.\n\"Good, then shall we?\"\nLee Shin Woo decided to bet it all on the giant Solar Fossil. It not only radiated the most heat, but it was also the most durable.\nIf he used all the Solar Fossils to reinforce this one, then it might be good enough to use as the golem’s main body. Lee Shin Woo steeled himself and began reinforcing the Solar Fossil.\n[Consuming a Solar Fossil to reinforce the Giant Solar Fossil! The Giant Solar Fossil is reinforced.]\n[Giant Solar Fossil (0.2%)]\n\"...Mm.\"\nWas it just him, or did seeing 0.2% feel really bad? If using one Solar Fossil reinforced it by 0.2%, then it was obvious what using 100 of them would yield.\nOf course, nothing might even happen if he reached that 100%, but once the percentage showed up, he felt an obsessive feeling of wanting to reach 100%.\n[It feels like it has gotten hotter than before, Master. Moreover, it has become tougher as well. It truly is an ore... a fossil designed to manufacture this golem.]\n\"...Yeah, I should just use them all, shouldn’t I?\"\nLee Shin Woo was invigorated by Rem’s cheer and continued reinforcing the Giant Solar Fossil. Should he say it was a relief? Around the middle, there were some Solar Fossils that increased the percentage by 0.3%.\nEven so, it wouldn’t make much of a difference, so... after he used up all of his Solar Fossils, the Giant Solar Fossil’s reinforcement was only 23.6% complete.\n\"...Do you think this will work?\"\n[I don’t think that will work. The heat and the durability aren’t sufficient...] Check latest chapters at novel[f]ire.net\nAs expected, Rem didn’t know how to beat around the bush. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo hated Rem for its bluntness, but he couldn’t take his anger out on someone who was innocent, so Lee Shin Woo sifted through his inventory, looking for a way to reinforce his Giant Solar Fossil.\nHowever, he came up empty. He couldn’t reinforce the Giant Solar Fossil anymore. But did that mean he should give up here? Like hell.\n[I-If it’s for the Titan, then I can even give up this rotten body of mine!]\n[Paul Zero, please use my body to give the Titan a new one!]\n\"No, it’s ok. I appreciate it though.\"\nNo matter how similar their mana patterns were, they wouldn’t be of any help to the Titan. The relationship between the Giants and the Titans was extremely one-sided! As he thought, he only had one choice left.\n\"Damn it. Now that it’s come to this, I have to leave...\"\n\"Shin Woo?\"\n\"Kratia, keep working. But... Chi Paul, Shino Rendu, Bisher Moon... and Ellata and Arogan.\"\nLee Shin Woo had called for all of his level 7 elites, as well as Shino Rendu. Unfortunately, the rest of his troops wouldn’t be helpful against Metafel, so he left the rest of his troops at the deepest part of the Giants’ domain. They would just help Metafel if they were found.\n\"You guys... if Metafel gets in while I’m gone, stop him. Just buying some time is plenty, so don’t risk your lives.\"\n[...Understood.]\n[That’s what I’ve been waiting for.]\n[I trust you, Sir Paul Zero.]\n[I will.]\nAll of their replies were reassuring, but when he recollected the sight of Metafel as he ran away, he couldn’t help but feel worried. Lee Shin Woo gritted his teeth and looked at each and every one of them.\n[...Sir Paul Zero.]\nEspecially at Shino Rendu, who was the only one who hadn’t reached level 7. He used most of the bones that they’d gotten from the battle on him, but he still hadn’t reached level 7.\n\"...Shino, you can’t die. You won’t be satisfied with exacting revenge on just Metafel, right?\"\n[Of course not.]\nShino replied reassuringly and then added.\n[I’ve abandoned my goal of killing Metafel by myself. Instead, when you’ve defeated him, I’d like to hit him at least once by your side. For that, I cannot die.]\n\"Good. That’s it. You can’t die.\"\nHe couldn’t lose his precious investment, now could he? With that in mind, Lee Shin Woo replied, and Shino Rendu responded with an absolutely refreshing smile. Lee Shin Woo smiled back, turned around, and activated the heroes’ authority.\nThat was, of course, entering the secret shop.\n[1] T/N: This joke doesn’t make sense in English. The word ’to say’ can also mean ’horse’, so his sentence could be interpreted as ’I gave you that horse’. The second line doesn’t make sense if you make this substitution, but Koreans will understand it. Trust me, it’s a terrible joke.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 33 part4",
    "content": "<Chapter 33. Titan - 4>\n\"Oh my, Mr. Shin Woo! Guten tag!\"\nOnce Lee Shin Woo entered the secret shop, Pleine, who had been sitting at the counter with a wearisome expression, lit up and waved at him. It seemed like she was quite happy to see him.\n\"It’s been such a long time since you last came. We may not have any bones left to sell, but you should come by at times to further our partnership...\"\n\"I’d like to improve this item. I need any materials that increase heat, durability or compression. Even better if you have a bone which belonged to an individual who could control heat.\"\nLee Shin Woo dispensed with the pleasantries and went straight to the point. Pleine picked up on this and soon adopted a serious expression, and surveyed the giant fossil that Lee Shin Woo had placed on the ground... the Giant Solar Fossil.\n\"It’s a sunlight stone (or used to be). When it changed, it began to radiate heat rather than light... though I have no idea what you plan on using this for.\"\nWhen she took into account Lee Shin Woo’s Bone Reinforcement skill, then there were a couple of items that she had in mind. Pleine turned around, entered into a storehouse-like place that wasn’t visible to Lee Shin Woo, and began to dig through her inventory while Lee Shin Woo waited nervously.\n\"I found it. I guess I didn’t sell it!\"\n\"What is it!?\"\nIt was worth coming here! It seemed like Pleine understood how urgent Lee Shin Woo felt, as rushed back and placed a deep, a very deep crimson-colored gem atop his bony hand.\n\"It’s called the Lunatic Scarlet and is a top rank ruby capable of containing a high amount of heat. Any fire magician would want it... Anyway, that doesn’t matter. It costs 41 million Perium!\"\n\"Here!\"\n\"Thank you!\"\nIt cost about as much as a level 7 elite bone, but Lee Shin Woo bought it without hesitation. He felt it as he gripped the ruby. Although it was quite small, in terms of its ability, it was in no way inferior to the Solar Fossil!\n[The Lunatic Scarlet is affected by the Bone Reinforcement skill and is transformed. You have acquired the Bone of Lunatic Scarlet!]\nIt was compatible with Bone Reinforcement as well! Although the transformation caused the item to assume an uglier form, the heat within, as well as its durability had increased, and Lee Shin Woo was sure that this would work.\n\"Bone Reinforcement!\"\n[Consuming the Bone of Lunatic Scarlet to reinforce the Giant Solar Fossil! A resounding success! The Giant Solar Fossil has become the Scarlet Solar Fossil!]\n[Scarlet Solar Fossil (48.7%)]\nHe expected as much, but it was indeed a resounding success. In the process of absorbing the Bone of Lunatic Scarlet, the Giant Solar Fossil had become compressed, and its durability, as well as its heat, had increased. Ultimately, it radiated a red light and emitted an overwhelming amount of heat, becoming a fossil about the size of a human being. However...\n\"Ugh.\"\nThis wasn’t enough. Even now, Kratia and Rem were desperately analyzing the core and were creating a blueprint for the golem’s body. However, the Scarlet Solar Fossil was far from enough for the golem. ...Even so, he was going in the right direction.\n\"Pleine, please. Give me some more Lunatic Scarlets... Give me as many as you can. I need at least three of them!\"\n\"I beg your pardon? If the Lunatic Scarlet wasn’t enough, then what... there’s nothing left in the storehouse. That’s quite the rare gem!\"\n\"Then, please give me something similar!\"\nPleine was flustered and opened her mouth wide from Lee Shin Woo’s request, but soon, she looked like she wasn’t going to give up. She was in charge of the secret shop, a place that would sell anything a hero needed, so it would be humiliating if she couldn’t provide what he needed.\n\"...Then, I’ll have to use some other methods to get what you need. I’ll be going on a business trip.\"\n\"What did you say?\"\n\"A business trip to the surface. I don’t have what you need, so I need to go get it for you. It’s been a long time since I’ve left the store. I don’t know what you’re trying to do, but... please provide me travel funds. It costs three secret shop permits.\"\nTravel funds were equivalent to three secret shop permits? He quickly gave her the permits but thought that something was off. Wait a sec, if secret shop permits were used as travel funds to go to the surface, then...\n\"I’ll be back soon, so please wait here. Please remember that I wouldn’t normally do this for anyone!\"\nOnce Pleine grabbed onto the three permits (normally, permits were invisible to the naked eye, but Pleine had a way of giving them a physical form), layered them together, and bit on them. At that moment, the red haired beauty abruptly disappeared from the shop.\n\"What the...\"\n[Jin Taylor: Hey, the barrier’s shaking! I think Metafel’s finally found where we are!]\n\"Ah, damn.\"\nHe’d expected as much, but to think Metafel would get there so quickly! This was probably a result of his heightened ability to dominate the surrounding mana from becoming a level 8 Eater. Or it could be the Eater karma’s ability, allowing him to sense the presences of nearby prey. Or maybe it was a bit of both.\n[Jin Taylor: Of course, it seems like he’s still a far ways off from getting to the deepest part, but that guy’s really no joke... Uh, I think Kratia will only last for a couple of hours!]\n\"Stay strong for a bit longer. Pleine left to get me some items.\"\n[Jin Taylor: To get you some items? In any case, you’re saying that you can’t come back right away, right? ...Shin Woo, you have to make a decision now. We can still run away with our level 6 or higher troops. We’ll be able to get away if we sacrifice the lower level ones.]\n\"What...?\"\nLee Shin Woo hadn’t expected Jin to come out and say that and was briefly caught off guard. Jin soon sighed and continued.\n[Jin Taylor: Most of the other guys are pretty weak, so they won’t be useless. But if Metafel manages to eat all of the elites, he’ll become so strong that it’ll be difficult to face him later. I don’t want to leave these guys behind, but...]\n\"I’m so shocked that you’d come to such a logical conclusion.\"\n[Jin Taylor: I have my own ideas too! ...You act like you don’t, but you do take a lot of risks. Until now, you’ve gotten by with your abilities, but... Well, even though you got some help from me or some other people, ultimately, you overcame all adversity, but it’s too much for you this time. That’s worrying for me.]\nHe was right. They hadn’t even seen the original form the of Titan’s Heart, or the Titan Bone Core as of yet (which was their only chance of success), the core itself had just barely been restored, and what’s worse, they were in the middle of researching how to recreate the main body while their time was limited.\nWhat’s worse, getting those materials relied solely on luck. It would be foolish to think that they could win in any safe manner... However, Lee Shin Woo replied firmly.\n\"But Jin, if we just leave him here and run, it’ll be even worse later on.\"\nIf he hadn’t seen Metafel evolve into a level 8, then he might’ve chosen to run. However, now that he’d born witness to his evolution, Lee Shin Woo couldn’t run away.\n\"It doesn’t matter if it’s us or not, Metafel can go anywhere to eat. The longer we just leave him be, the stronger he’ll become. We have to take care of him here, if for no other reason than ensure that he doesn’t become a bigger threat in the future.\"\n[Jin Taylor: That’s... it doesn’t have to be us that takes care of him though...]\n\"Maybe, but that’s only if I could actually trust the other seniors. In any case, I’ve decided that we have to finish him here, so don’t worry so much. If need be, I can just use the core myself.\"\n[Jin Taylor: If you do, then you really will die!]\n\"Yeah, but if I can kill him by dying once, it’s worth it. So, don’t worry and just wait for me. We can beat him. But we’re trying our very best to find a way that minimizes the damage to us.\" Thıs content belongs to noᴠelfire.net\n[Jin Taylor: ...]\nJin was speechless for a time but soon accepted his decision.\n[Jin Taylor: When you die, I die, alright?]\n\"You got it.\"\nOnce their conversation was finished, Kratia messaged him.\n[Kratia Melloi: I think it’s possible. Rem’s amazing.]\n\"What about processing the materials?\"\n[Kratia Melloi: We’ll need your help, but yeah, we can do it, Shin Woo. But to use the golem, you need at least High Rank Fire Resistance and at least the High Rank Darkness element. It would be even better if you have the Fire element as well.]\n\"At least high rank. I got it. I’ll try to get it that high.\"\nHe’d asked her to bring everything she had, so Lee Shin Woo could probably absorb one of them. Lee Shin Woo replied and simultaneously brought out his staff, beginning to train his Fire Resistance.\nLee Shin Woo used the ’Bone Winged Serpent’ staff, which amplified the strength of the opposite element to change ice into fire and use it on himself. It was quite a crude method of training, but still, it was an effective way of training his Fire Resistance!\n[Kratia Melloi: Also, Metafel just entered the Giants’ domain. Fortunately, the core is amplifying the effects of the complex spatial barriers around the deeper areas. It’ll be 1 hour and 54 minutes before he gets here.]\n\"If I bring you all the materials, how long would it take you to make the golem?\"\n[Kratia Melloi: I’m not sure, Shin Woo. Come back soon.]\n\"...I’ll come back as soon as possible.\"\nOnce they were finished, Lee Shin Woo spent his time hellishly training his Fire Resistance. Once in a while, Jin or Kratia would report on the current situation, which made him feel more and more uneasy. They would tell him that Metafel had pierced through some of the barrier, or that their blueprints were almost done!\n[Jin Taylor: I can kind of see him now, Shin Woo. Are you almost ready?]\n\"...\"\nIt had been three minutes since Jin’s last report, but then, the space seemed to shake and Pleine reappeared.\n\"I’m back... Kyaa! Why are you using fire in the shop!?\"\n\"I’m training my Fire Resistance. More importantly, were you able to get them?\"\n\"I was only able to get you one Lunatic Scarlet. I’m sorry.\"\n\"Ugh...!\"\nShit, he was screwed! Now their only option was to prepare for death and charge! But since she’d at least brought him one, he could absorb it to increase his Fire Resistance, and use the core himself without the golem. Lee Shin Woo gritted his teeth and extended his hand to ask for the Lunatic Scarlet. However, a small smile appeared on Pleine’s exhausted face.\n\"However, I brought you something even better. You sure are lucky, Mr. Shin Woo! Moreover, no one will buy it, it’s dirt cheap compared to its original selling price.\"\n[Lv8 Shard of the Sun Temple’s Central Pillar]\nShe had brought out a stone pillar... large enough to reach the ceiling of the shop. This was only a piece!? Moreover, the heat within was so much stronger than the Solar Fossil or the Lunatic Scarlet that it made him shudder.\nLee Shin Woo gaped and Pleine winked at him boastfully.\n\"There’s a ridiculous amount of heat contained within, but there aren’t actually a lot of applications for it. In the end, it can only really be used to make a weapon by cutting it down. However, it’s different for you, isn’t it, Mr. Shin Woo?\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"Altogether, it costs 350 million Perium. I’ve cut the price down as much as I could, but if you don’t have the money right now, then I can lend you... You have the money!? How did you get that much money!?\"\n\"Thank you so much, Pleine!\"\nLee Shin Woo quickly paid for his purchase and acquired the Shard of the Sun Temple’s Central Pillar. The moment it touched Lee Shin Woo’s hand, the shard shook and amplified his heat greatly!\nThe shard fell onto Lee Shin Woo, but when he touched it, the pillar emitted heat and disappeared. Surprisingly, just that was enough to increase his Fire Resistance slightly.\n[You have acquired the Lv8 Sun Fossil.]\n\"Nice, the name’s gotten simpler. Bone Reinforcement!\"\nHe felt like he should use the Scarlet Solar Fossil to reinforce the Sun Fossil, but when he took into account their compatibility with the golem, he concluded that the Solar Fossil was better to use for the golem’s body. Lee Shin Woo didn’t hesitate and reinforced the Scarlet Solar Fossil by using the Sun Fossil. As a result...\n[The Scarlet Solar Fossil is being reinforced to the very limit. In addition, it can now produce divine energy as well.]\n[You have acquired the Lv8 Hands That Cover the Sun.]\n[The Bone Reinforcement skill has become Lv11! Through Bone Reinforcement, you can use power once forgotten.]\n\"Wow...\"\nThe two miraculous objects had fused together in Lee Shin Woo’s hands, and ultimately, an unfathomable item had been born. Upon seeing that, Pleine was shocked. Did God lead Lee Shin Woo into making an item like this? Mm, it didn’t seem that way!\n\"Then, I’ll eat this one.\"\n[Absorbing the Bone of Lunatic Scarlet through Bone Reinforcement. Magic has increased by 23. The Intermediate Fire Resistance and Fire Element have become Lv10, and have evolved to the high rank level! Magic has increased by 75!]\nLee Shin Woo smiled at the overwhelming heat he felt well up in his body and turned around.\n\"Thank you so much, Pleine!\"\n\"Ah, please tell me what you used that on next time!\"\nLee Shin Woo waved his hand at her and left the secret shop. Pleine, who’d been left alone in the shop, looked vacantly as she thought back to the appearance of the ’Hands That Cover the Sun’. She soon shook her head and sat down in her spot. Then, she sighed and muttered.\n\"It’s been a long time since I’ve pulled so many strings. It’s a good thing I checked up on those ruins... I really hope no one will find out. Seriously, I really hope no one finds out...\"\nAt that time, the surface was in chaos, but it seemed as though her prayer had been answered, as no one had seen the red haired beauty.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 33 part5",
    "content": "<Chapter 33. Titan - 5>\nBy the time Lee Shin Woo had returned from his trip to the secret shop, the Giants’ domain was in chaos. It was because of the giant monster they could see from afar... Metafel.\nNot only had he entered their territory, but he was also going straight for the innermost part of it. He was also quite close.\n\"Shit, he’s almost here!\"\n\"Paul Zero, please hurry!\"\nLee Shin Woo urgently rushed over to Kratia and Rem. They had already planned out what components they needed, knew what processes they needed to take for each area, and had even prepared the chemical reagents. Now, all they needed were the actual materials!\n\"How’s this?\"\n\"Huh...?\"\nLee Shin Woo placed the Hands That Cover the Sun, which had become about half the size of Lee Shin Woo’s body, in front of them. At that moment, the temperature went up by several degrees. They weren’t misunderstanding anything; their eyes were really melting away.\n[Oh my... Master.]\n\"What exactly do you have to do to get it like this...\"\nThe Hands That Cover the Sun. Lee Shin Woo had fused several karmas together and had sublimated it into a unique, unknown shape.\nIt currently looked like a normal rock, and could even pass off as a bone. At the same time, it looked metallic, as it shined, yet it endlessly spewed out intense heat from within, which caused Kratia to back off from it.\n\"It’s a lot higher quality than we expected.\"\n\"So it won’t work?\"\n[No, it’s even better! It’s perfect! I’ll adjust the plans right away!]\nRem and Kratia faced each other and began adjusting their plans. Lee Shin Woo looked over the remaining blueprints, and once he’d gotten some idea of what they were doing, he helped out with the adjustments.\nThe quality of the material was so much different than normal, so it wouldn’t be strange for the adjustments to take at least an hour, but they finished the adjustments in just three minutes.\n[Kihat, I can smell it coming from over here! It’s over here!]\n[Anymore is... We can’t let him get through the last barrier. I’m not strong enough, but I’ll take him on first!]\n[I’ll help too.]\n\"I’m counting on you!\"\nMetafel had gotten close enough that everyone could feel his energy on their skin. There was only one layer left of the mana-made spatial barrier. If Metafel got any closer, it might impede their golem manufacturing, so Chi Paul and Bisher Moon simultaneously went to the frontlines.\n[Hey pig, over here!]\n[I’m a high level, something that you love so much. Why don’t you try taking my body, which my master bestowed upon me!]\n[Kuhat! Sure!]\nThey were both level 7 elites and simultaneously, they were the most nimble as well. Metafel wouldn’t be able to catch them easily. Although his health and magic had increased exponentially, his other stats hadn’t caught up.\n\"You can’t die, alright!?\"\n[Understood!]\nLee Shin Woo’s two subordinates shot out like arrows and passed through the barrier. Upon discovery, Metafel turned his head, and the two unleashed their attacks on him simultaneously.\n[Die!]\n[Kihehk... Hihik! I’m so happy!]\nThey had likely been preparing those strikes all this time, but they only managed to cut the outer layer of skin, looking as though they hadn’t actually inflicted much damage. Even though they were attacks from level 7 elites!\n’What’s worse, he’s able to change a portion of their attacks into mana and absorb it... But that much is...’\nWhile he was evolving, Metafel greedily consumed all energy that came at him and considered everything as his, but now that he’d actually finished evolving, it seemed like he couldn’t do that anymore. Learning that was big. They could win!\n\"They’re not enough. Ellata, Arogan! Help them!\"\n[We’ve been waiting for you to say that!]\n[I trust that you’ll revive the Titan with those very hands!]\n\"Don’t get too close to him. Protect them!\" ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ novel⦿fire.net\nLee Shin Woo sent the Giants to help and looked over the sole remaining Shino Rendu, who was gazing at Metafel. Despite his killer being right before him, he seemed quite relaxed.\n\"You stay here for now. You’ll get your moment to hold him back.\"\n[As you command, Paul Zero.]\n\"...You look a lot calmer than I expected you to be.\"\n[That’s probably because the Metafel over there isn’t the one that killed me.]\nShino Rendu just absent-mindedly concentrated his mana into his right arm and said calmly.\n[That’s not Metafel anymore. It’s just an Eater following its instincts. Of course, I still want to get my revenge on him, but rather than obsessing over my revenge, I’ll just take him down. Once I do that, I should be able to focus on something else. ...So, I’m just patiently waiting for my turn.]\nShino Rendu... this guy really didn’t get smarter once he’d become an undead. Lee Shin Woo event felt dizzy somewhere and could do nothing but nod his head at his words.\n\"Shin... Paul Zero, we can start now!\"\n[Master, please go ahead!]\n\"...Alright, let’s begin.\"\nThey had Kratia, who was knowledgeable in magic theory, Lee Shin Woo, who was innately talented in handling magic, and Rem, who had gained knowledge regarding golems, through a combination of chance and achievements. The three boldly broke the Hands That Cover the Sun into pieces and began making parts for the golem.\n\"The one who should be locking in the heat so it doesn’t escape is... Wait, it’s locking in the heat by itself! What material is this!?\"\n\"If you have time to be surprised, then use that time to manufacture the golem! The sections already getting hard!\"\n[Master, at this rate, manufacturing the golem will take too long.]\n\"Tch, then how about this...?\"\nLee Shin Woo felt the necessity in infusing his darkness mana from the start, while they were still building the components. To be exact, he would connect with the Bone Core, and then connect and assimilate the Hands that Cover the Sun, which would be used for the golem.\nBy doing so, he would attempt to ’convince’ the Hands That Cover the Sun that it was not perfect and would need to be processed, as it was still in an incomplete state. He knew it sounded strange to try to convince or awaken an inanimate object, but he was serious.\n\"It’s a bone, so I should be able to do it.\"\n\"Oh... It really has gotten a little easier to process.\"\n[Restoration has been stopped. I will begin immediately!]\nLee Shin Woo would set the shapes of each component and divide the materials accordingly while Kratia and Rem would engrave magic circles into said components and process them. Because of Lee Shin Woo’s darkness magic, their work progressed better than expected. However...\n\"This is way too hot!\"\n[Once we are done manufacturing the golem, please repair me, Master.]\n\"Sure... I’ll fix you no matter what, so hold on for now.\"\nBecause the materials emitted so much heat, there was no getting around Kratia and Rem getting injured, even during the processing phase. Of course, Lee Shin Woo alone was fine, as he possessed High Rank Fire Resistance. Therefore, he moved twice as fast as the other two.\n[Kuhaaaaaah! So you were here! I’ll eat you all!]\n[Tch, this monster!]\n[I feel bad for the title of 12 generals. You’re just a monster!]\nWhereas the battle on the frontlines had intensified. Actually, it was much too one-sided to be called a battle. Metafel was attempting to eat them while his troops desperately dodged the teeth and tongues that sprouted all over Metafel’s body!\n[The Titan’s Pride!]\n[We’re almost there... We’re almost there, so we can’t let you interfere!]\n[You guys smell delicious as well!]\nMetafel rampaged about, as though he would gobble up the Giants, Chi Paul, and Bester Moon right this instant, and Lee Shin Woo’s troops harassed him and launched attacks which Metafel couldn’t ignore. But while they were doing that, Metafel’s arms suddenly swelled and dozens of tongues came out, wrapping around the Giant Arogan’s hand.\n[Shall we get a taste!?]\n[You’ve stopped being human, you trash!]\nArogan was shocked and pulled with all his might, but Metafel’s astonishing strength prevented him from pulling away; instead, he was pulled closer to Metafel himself! In an instant, dozens of tongues wrapped around not only his arm but his shoulder as well.\n[Eeek...!]\n[How dare you do that to my comrade!]\nBefore Arogan was eaten, Ellata threw a boulder at Metafel.\nDid they transfer their mana into the rock? There was an incredible amount of force behind the boulder, and it rushed over and severed the tongues capturing Arogan. But by then, one of Arogan’s arms had already been absorbed by Metafel.\n[Ku...haaahk...!]\nThat wasn’t all. It seemed as though Metafel’s attack possessed some sort of paralysis ability, as Arogan’s body shook and he remained in place, letting out agonized cries.\n[Kihiiiii! What great strength. Giants are great! It’s the most delicious thing I’ve eaten thus far!]\nMetafel, who’d absorbed Arogan’s arm, got a bit taller, and then, lunged for Arogan as if intending to finish his plate. Metafel’s stomach split in half and countless tongues came out!\n[Did I leave some? We can’t let the food go to waste!]\n[Keuk...!]\n[Arogan!]\nAlthough Metafel’s body had become fat, he could charge incredibly fast, and if Ellata hadn’t kicked Arogan away, then he would’ve been in Metafel’s stomach right now without being able to resist.\n[Eat this!]\nThen, Ellata struck the ground, creating a wall of dirt. By adding her force and her mana into it, she could change the ground; that was Ellata’s ability as a hero. Because of that, Metafel ended up eating dirt rather than Arogan.\n[Kek, don’t get in the way! I’ll eat you all... and become a perfect warrior!]\n[You disgusting bastard... how dare you call yourself a warrior!]\nAlthough she had died once before, she hadn’t forgotten her pride as a warrior, nor the Titan’s Pride. Thus, to her (Ellata is indeed a woman), Metafel was the very definition of trash, as he, Metafel, had lost all reason and had assumed such a disgusting form.\nBut while deliberating how she could follow up from her dirt wall and inflict more damage onto him, she suddenly felt a new power surging through her entire body.\n[Mm, could this be...?]\n[Kyaha!]\nBut one problem with that was that Metafel had likewise sensed that energy. Metafel had forgotten all about eating Arogan and Ellata and raised his head; he abandoned all those he had been fighting thus far and began to run towards the source of the energy.\n[Yeah, that’s probably the tastiest! I should eat that first!]\n[No!]\n[Stop him!]\nAside from Arogan, who still hadn’t recovered from his paralysis, all the other troops panicked and followed behind Metafel. However, Metafel ran with such speed that it seemed as though he’d activated a new skill, as he soon lost them and began running towards his destination. Ultimately, he broke through the final barrier in one go.\nAn Eater possessed a skill that weakened spatial or magical restraints once they had picked their target!\n[There you are!]\n\"Damn it. I can’t move right now...!\"\nLee Shin Woo, Kratia, and Rem were working hard on manufacturing the golem, but once Lee Shin Woo saw Metafel break through the last spatial barrier and could see him with the naked eye, he furrowed his brow.\nThe three were applying the mana extremely delicately and were finishing up by engraving a magic circle onto the core itself. Once they were finished with this, they would be able to synchronize the main body and the core, which would finally allow Lee Shin Woo to operate the golem.\n\"So why now!? He came at the worst time!\"\nThis was such a cliche situation; they were almost finished with their task, but the enemy comes rushing in to interfere! Lee Shin Woo grit his teeth, as he couldn’t look away from the core, but there was someone already blocking Metafel’s way.\n[I’ll buy you some time.]\nShino Rendu said calmly and stepped forward. Lee Shin Woo actually felt uneasy from how calm Shino was, but he didn’t have the time to say that. After all, Metafel was already quite close.\nShino’s right arm was wrapped in a red light and swelled. He took a step forward, face absent of any fear. While sensing an overpowering mass rushing towards him.\n[Give it to me!]\n[Heup!]\nRight after Metafel’s greed-filled scream resounded through the grounds... Kwang! Which was accompanied by the sound of an explosion. Was that the sound of Kratia’s barrier exploding?\n[Guooooooooooh!]\nThat wasn’t it. Shino Rendu had desperately mustered his strength and forcefully uppercut Metafel’s groin with his red fist... or what used to be his groin. The sound had been a result of Shino Rendu’s fist making contact with Metafel’s groin.\nThe lower body armor, which had protected him, broke apart, and rotten flesh, tongues, and rotten flesh spewed everywhere, so something had definitely burst. Something that was quite precious to a man!\n[Kuhaaaaaaaahk!]\nWas that really the power of a level 6? The power behind Shino Rendu’s fist had temporarily overcome its limits and the level 8 Eater hadn’t been able to endure his blow, as Metafel flew through the air. He only flew into the air for a short while, but to those witnessing the event, it seemed like it lasted an eternity.\n[I’ve only taken a single step, but I feel like I’ve caught up to you a little bit, Paul Zero.]\nShino Rendu said proudly. His own right arm hadn’t been able to endure the shock, as his muscles and even bones had been ripped apart. However, he soon activated his other cheat skill, Super Regeneration, and healed his injuries.\nNormally, when one gets a hit in like this, they would turn the tables on their enemy, but that wasn’t the case here.\n[How dare you lay your hands on the body of one of the 12 generals!]\n[Haht!]\nMetafel’s rage had peaked and he attempted to wrap Shino Rendu with hundreds of tongues, but before they could reach him, Chi Paul shot out dozens of bone blades, severing them. Immediately after, Bisher Moon arrived, grabbed onto Shino, and retreated.\n[Can you keep fighting?]\n[I can, as long as my wound heals. My mana’s overflowing now after I absorbed the surrounding heat.]\n[As expected...! There was a reason you were waiting here!]\nIt wasn’t just them. Ellata, who had arrived a bit late, drew a giant spear from the earth and looked at Metafel. The one-armed Arogan concentrated his energy into his remaining arm, letting out quite a bit of energy.\n[Eek, Eeeeeeeek...!]\nMetafel was severely wounded, so it would take him a lot of time to get through them.\n[We might not even need the golem, Paul Zero. Your subordinates are just that strong.]\nThere were four level 7 elites facing Metafel, as well as Shino Rendu, who was becoming stronger at an exponential rate.\n[But it’s the general responsibility to take down the enemy general, so we’ll leave it to you. After the golem is finished, that is.]\nOf course, they were bluffing. If they were capable of taking Metafel down by themselves, then Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t have gone through so much trouble. However, he decided to believe in their bluff. Lee Shin Woo used his mana to sublimate the core even further and grinned.\n\"Alright, I’ll be there in a minute.\"",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 33 part6",
    "content": "<Chapter 33. Titan - 6>\nThe battle was fierce. The Eater, Metafel, had set his sights on the core and rushed towards it, whereas the elites couldn’t back off, so long as Lee Shin Woo was behind them.\n[We have to avoid a direct confrontation. We have to be especially wary of those tongues. Each and every one of them has a High Rank Paralysis ability. He has all the abilities that help him eat his prey...!]\n[This asshole’s really tough... Shino!]\n[Heup!]\nShino stepped forward, as the one least worried about self-preservation.\nHe was aware of his limitations as a level 6, and the only skill that could overcome those limits and damage Metafel was... funnily enough, a skill called Titan Punch; he focused everything into that Titan Punch.\nOnce he used the skill, he wouldn’t be able to move for quite a long time, but because he was fighting against the target of his revenge, Metafel, the damage dealt would be amplified, so it was definitely a skill capable of inflicting a severe injury!\n[Kuhaaaaaahk!]\n[Now! Open wide. Eat ice and dirt!]\nShino was responsible for the offense, while the Giants were entirely responsible for defense. They wouldn’t let Metafel advance even a single step!\nEspecially since Ellata possessed the ability to control the earth as she pleased; Metafel, whose entire body had become a giant mouth, opened wide. But because the Giants pelted him with ice and dirt, Metafel could neither attack nor advance. It was the best skill to have against Metafel.\n[Kuwaaaah!]\n[Damn it!] Check latest chapters at noᴠelfire.net\nHowever, Metafel soon familiarized himself with her attack pattern. Metafel continuously drew in both ice and dirt, and at some point, threw it back out at Ellata!\nMoreover, his saliva was mixed in, which contained a powerful acid, as well as a paralysis ability, so it was quite the attack. Ellata quickly formed a dirt wall and blocked Metafel’s counter, but Metafel’s attack was much too strong, and her wall broke soon after.\n[Keuk!]\n[This dirty bastard is really...]\n[Hoo, I’m going!]\nRight when Ellata was about to be hit by Metafel’s vomit, intense flames rose up into the air and burned Metafel’s attack. It was none other than Chi Paul’s ability.\n[This is the power of the flames that Master gave me!]\nThe surging mana throughout his entire body turned into flames, and he shot them out at Metafel, halting his advance. Metafel pressed forward as if to eat those flames as well, but fortunately, it seemed like Metafel wasn’t very compatible with elemental power!\nPerhaps the reason Kratia had been able to stop his evolution for so long was because of the negative effect of his karma? Metafel hadn’t been able to completely absorb the fire, as the fire burst within his stomach, causing internal damage.\n[How troublesome! I’ll roast and eat you all!]\n[You’ll be cooked before you get the chance!]\nThe flames were hot enough (due to him being a level 7 elite) that they left deep marks on his body, but Metafel’s body was ridiculously large.\nThough burned by the flames, Metafel continued to advance. Bisher Moon also rushed over, and with his sharp nails severed Metafel’s tongues without pause.\n[Damn it. I cut and I cut, but there’s no end to them. Moreover, it feels like my body is melting away just by getting close...! So this is a level 8!]\n[Don’t falter. There’s nowhere left to retreat!]\n[Tch... Kuhaaaaaaahk!]\nUltimately, Bisher wrapped his body in darkness. Bisher had been saving his mana, but decided that now was the time to use it; the moment he released all that mana, Bisher became one with his clan’s symbol, the very moon which didn’t exist in the Empire.\nThat miraculous connection caused Bisher’s arms to become hotter, and his nails to become longer.\n[I didn’t... come back to be devoured by this two-bit beast!]\nAs the mana consumption was severe, he couldn’t maintain the skill for very long, but if he didn’t use it now, he wouldn’t have a chance to use it. All ten of his fingernails were as sharp as the finest blade, and he swung them forward. Even a level 8’s body would be cut by them!\n[Kuooooooht!]\n[I’ll cut everything on you!]\nChi Paul and Bisher Moon fought hard, causing Metafel to continue to accrue injuries. While they kept him busy, Shino Rendu let out another powerful attack, causing Metafel to retreat a few steps back.\n[You bastarrrrrrrds!]\nHe wanted to eat the Giants, as well as that fragrant mana beyond them! But because he was prevented from doing so numerous times by the elites, his desire continued to swell until it reached a peak.\nAt that moment, his body cracked, and deep black tongues burst out between those cracks. Anything that comprised ’Metafel’, whether it be his bones, his blood vessels, his muscles, or even his skin was optimized for ’eating’.\n[Kuhaat!]\n[Keuk!?]\nOne who reaches level 8 forces mana to assimilate with them. Anyone who comes within their ’turf’ would weaken, and this ability could even incapacitate their opponents as well.\nMetafel instinctively raised his ability to its very limit and dyed the surrounding mana with his ’Eater’ karma. The characteristics of the eater karma had been injected into the dominated mana.\n[I can’t move...!]\n[The magic!]\nThey felt it as Metafel was sucking in the ambient mana. It was quite shudder-inducing, but contrary to one might think it was only the preparation that came before the actual eating.\n[Kuhaa...]\nMetafel took a step forward. The moment he assimilated the mana, his body broke down, but in its place, countless tongues took their place; now his body was entirely composed of tongues. Bones and tongues, skin and tongues, blood and tongues, muscles and tongues... Metafel’s body overflowed with tongues, as if ready to eat each and every one of them.\n[Eat... I’ll eat you all!]\n[Kaha!]\n[Kiik!?]\nHowever, the moment he was about to begin eating, Arogan, who was able to resist the mana eating, rushed forward and attacked Metafel by himself. Metafel stretched out his tongues in order to eat not only him, but the others as well, but Arogan desperately grabbed all of them and pulled.\n[Where do you think... Kuaaaaaaaah!]\n[Keuk, you troublesome bastard!]\nArogan’s ability as a hero was ’taunt’. That miraculous ability would draw his opponent’s attention, actions, and even magic towards him.\nIt was an ability that would allow him to be a shield for his party, and that’s how he had lived his life as well. And by taunting one last time, he had decided to sacrifice his life to save the rest of his party!\n[Arogan!]\n[I’ve already lost an arm. It’s better that I sacrifice myself, Ellata! Survive until the very end and stay by the Titan’s side!]\nAlthough Arogan had bought enough time for her to retreat, she not only didn’t retreat, but attempted to save him as well, so Arogan yelled firmly. He activated his skill to its limit, drawing all of Metafel’s tongues towards him. It was to the point that his body was no longer visible.\n[Keuk. Urgh...!]\n[Arogaaaaan!]\nIn the end, they were unable to see Arogan. Through his sacrifice, Bisher, Chi Paul, and Shino Rendu were barely able to retreat and gasped (though they really couldn’t). They kept their eyes on Metafel, but Ellata, unable to contain her fury, struck the ground with her hands, encasing her hands in dirt and ice mixed gloves. Then, she charged at Metafel.\n[Give me back my comrade, you monster!]\nMaybe it was just her, but it felt like her body was overflowing with power. She was sure that it was because of her anger and believed it to be so. However...\n[Kuhaaaaaaaahk!]\nMetafel screamed before she could land a hit. Did her intent strike first before her body? Ellata fists shook in surprise, and a portion of Metafel’s body (which had become a mass of tongues) burst.\n[Huaaaaaaaaaah!]\nA Giant’s roar resounded throughout the area. It wasn’t Ellata. It was none other than Arogan!\n[Lv7 Bone Titan Knight - Arogan]\nEllata’s eyes widened when she saw Arogan tear through a portion of Metafel’s body and come out. Arogan had been reborn; his once rotten flesh had been replaced by tough jet-black bones that went from head to toe.\n[Titan! Oh Titan!]\n[Oh, ooooh...]\nHe’d lost all his flesh, but that didn’t mean he was weaker. On the contrary, the essence of his karma had enriched his bones and had made him even stronger... Plus, his lost arm had been restored in bone form.\nHonestly, there was a world of difference in his power compared to before he had been swallowed by Metafel!\n[You’re the same, Ellata!]\n[Is that so...!?]\n[Kuaaaaaaaaaah!]\nMetafel screamed in acute pain and shot out his tongues at Arogan! However, Arogan stretched out his jet black arm and blocked the tongues.\n[Kuuuuuu! Ellata!]\n[Kihiaaaah!]\nOf course, there was still a clear level disparity. He was still weaker in terms of pure strength, and his reinforced bones would still melt.\nHowever, he could endure it. He could fight him head-on. Seeing that, Ellata felt something inside of her, some core part of her was sublimating into something greater. Then, she realized.\n’The Titan has returned.’\nThey’d already heard that the Titan’s strength would not last forever. They’d also heard that the Titan’s appearance might not be as they imagined. However, the Titan Tribe had prayed and wished for the Titan’s return for hundreds of years, and those prayers themselves became a mass of karma, amassing within the Giants’ minds and bodies.\nAnd when the Titan walked upon the grounds of Heita once more, they would be able to accept that karma! That karma was only for them, and would entrust them with the Titan’s Pride!\n[Huooooooooh!]\nJust like Arogan, Ellata roared and her body began to change. Because she hadn’t lost her flesh, there was another evolution available to her, aside from Bone Titan. Her body lessened to about 2 meters, but in exchange, not only did her muscles and bones become tougher but her once dead blood had been replaced by pure mana blood vessels.\nHer rotten equipment broke apart, just like her once rotten body, and her bare body was covered in red bone armor. All of the karma she had amassed in her life (Perium) sublimated into a greater form: her armor.\n[Lv7 Titan Armored Knight - Ellata]\nShe was repaid for the karma she’d amassed for so many years, but she wasn’t the only one that had changed, now was she? The Giants, who were hidden deep with their territory, couldn’t endure the surging power and they all roared and came out of hiding. Right now, they were all being reborn as new elites!\n[Lv6 Elite Titan Knight]\n[Lv6 Elite Titan Rider]\n[Lv5 Elite Titan Soldier]\nHundreds of Giants overflowed with new strength and new mana. The heat caused the ice, which hadn’t melted for dozens of years, to melt and flow into currents of water, and even that water soon evaporated.\nThe ground was exposed. The earth that had been hidden for so many years along with the Titan’s Heart was so pure and clean as if blessing the Giants.\n\"Oh...\"\nJin, who had been freed of lugging Lee Shin Woo around for a change, saw the Giants as they roared from all directions and could only say one thing.\n\"I feel like it’d be a cinch if we fought Ethan Cruz now...\"\n\"Don’t be careless. But against Metafel, yeah, we won by a landslide.\"\nKratia, who’d finished with the intense manufacturing and had obtained the fruits of her labor, wiped her forehead proudly. Creating this golem had significantly increased her skill level in artifact manufacturing, so she couldn’t help but be happy. However, what made her even more happy was...\n\"Go get him, Titan.\"\nThe fact that she’d brought back a legend with her very own hands.\n[Yeah.]\nThe Titan, Lee Shin Woo replied.\nThe Titan, which had returned in the form of red bones, took a step forward.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 33 part7",
    "content": "<Chapter 33. Titan - 7>\n[You have brought back high level magic engineering and further improved upon it, allowing you to create the highest rank level 8 artifact! Perhaps this is the beginning of a legend. Proficiency in all mana-related skills increases significantly and Magic has increased by 50!]\nThe moment they finished engraving a magic circle onto the last component, it synchronized and combined with the core, and that message appeared before Lee Shin Woo.\nKratia, who’d really helped in the endeavor, achieved a feat that made her go white, and Rem, who’d help them both, gained an increased understanding of golems.\n\"Shin Woo...!\"\n\"...Nice.\"\n[That’s a relief, Master.]\nThey briefly exchanged looks and then, as if promising beforehand, extended their hands towards the completed golem. But once they began reading the golem’s information, Lee Shin Woo and Kratia wondered whether they had actually succeeded or not.\n[Lv8 Titan Bone Golem]\n[A golem that personifies a constantly erupting volcano. The Titan was created to satisfy man’s greed to control mother nature. In the process of resurrecting the golem, the power of the sun has been reinforced, and only a human who can survive this intense heat can properly control this golem.]\n[Fully Charged. Upon activation, the core can run for a total of 240 seconds, and once that time is up, the core requires a recharge time of 60 days.]\n[If the user’s level is less than level 8, then their level will be temporarily adjusted to level 8, and all stats will increase. However, this can be detrimental if the body cannot properly handle that increased power.]\nThe core could fit into the palm of his hand, as it was compressed to the limit, but he had several questions, as the explanation didn’t explain things clearly.\nBut at the very least, there were a few things he could understand: that it could only be used for 240 seconds and that after that 240 seconds had passed, it had to recharge for 60 days!\n\"Keuk... But now’s not the time to be hesitating!\"\n\"Do your best!\"\n[Good luck, Master!]\nLee Shin Woo grabbed the completed golem, rushed forward, and infused a portion of his mana into the core. He achieved a complete synchronization with the core, and activated the golem!\n[Beginning synchronization.]\nThe core, which had been dormant until now, suddenly emitted a blinding light, and the outside layers of the core came off and attached to Lee Shin Woo one layer at a time.\nThe equipment he’d had equipped were all unsummoned. A golem’s external equipment wrapped around Lee Shin Woo’s skull, arms, ribs, pelvis, and feet, and it looked as though he was wearing some sort of red bone armor.\n[Synchronization complete. Activating the Titan.]\nThe core attached to his chest and emitted an even more radiant light than before. No matter how he thought about it, he was definitely a giant hero, but the moment he thought that Lee Shin Woo’s body felt hot. No, it was actually the core’s heat spreading throughout the outer equipment!\nThe magic circles, which were substituted for the Mana Breathing ability, which had caused a small tribe to evolve into the giant Titans over a span of hundreds of years, activated simultaneously, causing his body to grow in an instant.\n[Activating Titan. Remaining time: 240 seconds.]\nLee Shin Woo felt like his body had grown instantly. To be honest, his body was inside of a golem right now, but through the core, he had completely synchronized with the golem and could now move and feel the golem’s body as if it were his own.\n’Did the Titans always see the world from so high up? I see... it makes sense that Arema Steelworker became so arrogant.’\nHe finished growing, tapering off at 7 meters tall. He spread his senses throughout his entire body and realized that his five senses had been completely synchronized with the golem. The ground seemed so far away when he looked down. At that moment, he could understand the Titans, who’d looked so large.\n’It’s hot.’\nDespite his High Rank Fire Resistance, it felt hot inside the golem due to the Bone of Lunatic Scarlet. But at the same time, it also felt refreshing, as his mana was being amplified and being spread throughout the golem.\nThe pleasant feeling offset any pain he felt, and getting over it didn’t take very long. It was suffocating, as it felt as though his mana, which had been swallowed up the heat, was changing everything in the world into heat. It would be most apt to describe this feeling as omnipotence.\n[Temporarily increasing Strength and Health by 3,000, and Agility and Magic by 2,000.]\nLee Shin Woo’s level was forcefully adjusted to level 8, and his stats had been amplified to match the golem. His original stats were 7,922, but now, they totalled out at 17,822, which meant that he had instantaneously reached a mid level 8’s power!\n’The fact that it increased my stats so much must mean that I’m just that weak. The more my stats increase, or in other words, the less of a stat difference between myself and the golem’s body there is, then the fewer stats I gain from the transformation.’\nIt frustrated him that he had to borrow the golem’s strength to fight Metafel head to head, but he wasn’t going to look a gift horse in the mouth. He would temporarily become the possessor of such strength, which made him realize just how powerful a level 8 truly was!\n[Hoo... Heup!]\nBut the moment Lee Shin Woo, who had completely combined with the golem stepped forth, he felt a change occur within the Giants that were fighting desperately on the frontlines.\nArogan, who had been eaten and wondered if this was the end, had been reborn with a body entirely made of bone and seemed much stronger than before. If that wasn’t enough, Ellata had also evolved as well!\n[Oh Titan!]\n[Huaaaaaaaahp!]\nIt wasn’t just them. The other Giants, who had hidden away within their territory and witnessed the Titan’s rebirth, began to change as well. Arogan and Ellata were the first to be connected to him, and the other Giants were connected to him through his darkness mana one by one.\nOnce he’d become a Titan, his (or the Titan’s) mana filled the battlefield, changing the very roots of the Giants’ existence!\n[You have resurrected the Titan. The Giants have realized that they hadn’t waited in vain, and are no longer disillusioned. They are now capable of dreaming something anew. They are no longer the dead, who are trapped by death, but have conquered death and have been reborn as Titans.]\n[You have acquired the title, ’Descendant of the Titans’. All stats have increased by 15. All Titans who follow you are buffed by 10%.]\n[Through the item you have created, you have completely broken apart God’s designated hierarchy. While you are operating the Titan, the Rebellion skill activates, further increasing your stats by 16%!]\nSeveral messages appeared, but Lee Shin Woo felt more overwhelmed by the darkness mana links that formed between him and the Giants one by one.\nThe sorrow and tenacity of these Giants, who had waited for the Titan’s return for so many years! All of that was in the past now, and Lee Shin Woo had given them the courage to take a new step forward. At the same time, they all looked towards Lee Shin Woo.\nLee Shin Woo was the Titan’s Descendant, the very personification of the word ’miracle’ to them! At that moment, he had become the Titan’s king, and it was now his mission to lead the Giants!\n[The Titan is...]\n[Moving!]\n[Hooo....!]\nLee Shin Woo took another step forward under their gazes, wielding a gigantified Drake Horn Lance that matched the size of the Titan golem.\n[By gigantifying the Lv5 Drake Horn Lance, its attack power increases exponentially. And by absorbing the overwhelming heat, it is temporarily elevated to Lv6.]\nNow that he wielded such intense fire he couldn’t use a lightning weapon, so he chose the Drake Horn Lance, as it could be wielded with any element and was also a high rank weapon as well.\nIt was indeed a good choice. The moment he wielded the lance, the fire was concentrated in the lance, and lance was dyed red. It was as though it had synchronized with the golem’s body itself!\n[Heup!]\nLee Shin Woo softly leaped. Bisher, Shino, and Chi Paul moved out of the way, and Ellata struck the ground, creating a mounting block for him. The moment he stepped foot onto that, Arogan, who had been fighting against Metafel, grabbed onto Metafel and threw him into the air.\n[Kiihaaaaaaaaaaaa!]\nMetafel’s tongues let out a frightening sound and were simultaneously severed. He cried out and whirled round and round within the air, but once he noticed Lee Shin Woo, he extended his tongues at Lee Shin Woo without waiting, as though to say ’nice of you to come’.\nHowever, the Titan’s heat wouldn’t allow his tongues to approach. What’s worse, the heat was beginning to control more and more of the area, so the closer Metafel got, the more his body would light aflame!\n’The fire ain’t half bad. It’s the best... especially when fighting against him!’\nJust by existing, the golem’s body prevented Metafel from attacking, and the flames would continuously chip away at Metafel’s resistance. This authority, above all else, proved to Lee Shin Woo that this golem was indeed level 8!\nLee Shin Woo, who could fully enjoy that ability across his entire body, controlled the flames with his mind and gathered all of them into the tip of his lance. It was such a high degree of mana control that anyone would marvel at it, but it was as natural as breathing for Lee Shin Woo at this point.\n[Kihik, Kiheeeeeeeehk! In the end, you seek to kill me!] Newest update provıded by N()velFire.net\n[Hoo... Heuaaahp!]\nHe condensed the energy to the max, and then, shot the Drake Horn Lance at Metafel as if it were exploding. Although it wasn’t clad in lightning, it still contained the essence of Bursting Thunder, and at the same time, he had applied Shadow Horn to it as well.\n[Kuhahk!]\n[Critical Hit!]\n[The Intermediate Shadow Horn skill has become Lv9. All stats have increased by 6.]\n[High Rank Fire has become Lv2. Magic has increased by 20.]\nThe lance pierced through the center of Metafel’s body, and the flames erupted from the lance, burning Metafel’s entire body. The white hot flames were so bright that it was difficult to even look straight at them.\n[Kik... Don’t think... that you’re above me!]\nDespite that, Metafel didn’t die. On the contrary, Metafel struggled to consume the flames in order to make them his own. Though his tongues were constantly melted away by the flames, more would come out from all across his body; there was nothing but hatred contained in his tongues as he continuously licked the flames.\n[Beyond the power of a corps... An absolute being!]\n[Heuup. Heup!]\nHe forcefully thrust his lance downwards and forced Metafel onto the ground. Like he’d previously done to his subordinate, Setoin, Lee Shin Woo embedded the lance into the ground so that Metafel wouldn’t be able to move. He was overpowering Metafel, to the point that one wouldn’t think that they were both level 8s!\n[Kyaaaaaaahk!]\nHowever, this couldn’t be explained by anything other than Metafel’s poor luck. If he had been given a little bit more time, he might’ve become a beast that devoured the entire Empire. But he had been forced to face off against a Titan, who utilized the element most disadvantageous for him.\n[Remaining time: 118 seconds.]\n[That’s plenty of time.]\nOnce he landed on the floor, Lee Shin Woo checked how much time he had left and muttered relaxingly. Then, he activated Bone Armory once more. He had summoned two more Drake Horn Lances in both hands.\n[Heup!]\n[Guaaaaaahk!]\nLee Shin Woo stabbed two more lances into the resisting Metafel’s body. If he actually knew where Metafel’s vital spots were, he would’ve stuck them there, but now that Metafel’s body had turned into tongues, he had no choice but to go about it this way.\n[You bastard, the Empire will...!]\n[Hahp!]\nLee Shin Woo could summon eight weapons total. He summoned eight Drake Horn Lances, embedded them into Metafel’s body, and released the golem’s heat through them. It looked as though he were burning a witch.\n[The Archmage... will... kill...!]\n[Yeah. Wait patiently. I’ll kill him at some point and send him over to you.]\nEven though Metafel’s entire body was burning, he attempted to consume the flames. However, Lee Shin Woo grabbed two of the embedded spears and concentrated the overwhelming heat, making it so that it was difficult to even make out Metafel’s original form.\n[The Mercenary King’s...]\n[...You should’ve just stayed a mercenary.]\nMetafel boasted a frighteningly tenacious vitality, but the moment Lee Shin Woo spoke, he blew up the eight lances and killed him.\nA tremendous amount of heat was condensed in a single spot, burning his body to bits. But while he was disappearing, Lee Shin Woo noticed that Metafel had successfully devoured a portion of the flames, making him wonder what would’ve happened had the Titan’s flames been a tiny bit weaker.\n[...Hoo.]\nIn any case, Metafel was dead. Once he made sure that Metafel wasn’t responding anymore, Lee Shin Woo raised his head and declared to all his troops, who were all looking at him.\n[Good work everyone. We won.]\nThe battle had ended.\nThe long battle in the glacial mountains had finally come to an end.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 34 part1",
    "content": "<Chapter 34. Heaven Defying General - 1>\nThe moment he was sure of Metafel Rerdan’s death, Lee Shin Woo was swarmed by lines of text that he should be familiar with by now, but wasn’t.\n[You have hunted one of the 12 Generals, the Eater Metafel Rerdan! All heroes who contributed gain 50,000,000 Perium, and all stats are increased by 100. You have acquired 15 permits to God’s secret shop. Proficiency in all combat-related skills increases significantly!]\n[The High Rank Combat Sense skill has become Lv3. Agility has increased by 20.]\n[The High Rank Fire Resistance skill has become Lv2. Magic has increased by 10.]\n[The Mana Acceleration skill has become Lv2. Magic has increased by 10.]\n[The High Rank Command skill has become Lv3. All stats have increased by 5.]\nKilling one of the 12 generals meant removing a portion of the curse that covered the Empire. He’d not only taken down one of those generals, but Metafel had grown to level 8 and would’ve been a huge threat to the other heroes, so he was given an unprecedented reward.\nHe’d gained the same amount of stats, but he’d been given at least 50% more Perium and permits than normal. From what he’d been told, permits to God’s secret shops were fragments of God’s power, so he knew that, if nothing else, God had sacrificed much of her power to give him these.\n[Through your fight against one of the 12 generals, you have shown your ability as a leader, a warrior, and a thief. You have achieved a feat worthy of the Joker karma. All stats have increased by 20.]\n[The Joker karma has become even stronger. The Joker’s innate skills have grown. The Acting skill has become Lv18, the Disguise skill Lv7, and the Instigate skill Lv8. Magic has increased by 10.]\nWas that all? Lee Shin Woo had used all the means available to him to win this battle, and had made the title of Joker proud, causing his Joker karma to become even stronger.\nLee Shin Woo, who read through the messages, smiled happily. Just how many stats had he gained from this battle!? As he thought, it was worth pushing himself to manufacture the golem and to fight Metafel head on.\n[You have received God’s grace. The Invisible Heart skill’s max level has increased by 10.]\nFinally, his last message was of God’s grace. This time, too, his Invisible Heart’s max level had increased. He’d killed 7 of his undead seniors through the hero quest, and had killed two of the 12 generals, so his Invisible Heart skill’s max level had gone up to 127.\n’...It’s still not enough. I still don’t know how exactly this affects me.’\nIt would’ve been nice if he could precisely feel and control Invisible Heart. No, it would be possible sometime in the future. He would be able to do so in the future, he thought, and stiffly nodded his head. As if this were all planned, the Titan golem’s duration time just finished up.\n[The Titan Bone Golem’s core is recharging its heat. Time until fully charged: 60 days.]\nFirst, the mana that flowed through the golem’s exterior body disappeared, and the body rapidly shrunk. Then, Lee Shin Woo’s synchronization with the core was released, and the exterior body returned to its original state, attaching back onto the core.\nThe core went back to charging, but because the core was surrounded by material which would eternally emit heat, it didn’t freeze its surroundings like before. Due to that, he could say that he had indeed completed the golem. Even if he left it alone, it was ’fully armed’ now.\n\"Hoo, it feels like I’ve suddenly become a lot weaker.\"\nLee Shin Woo grabbed the core, softly landed on the floor, and smiled bitterly. So this is what it felt like to be a giant hero. Now he understood how the Titans, who were obsessed with their size, felt.\n[Oh Titan!]\n[Congratulations on your resurrection!]\nLee Shin Woo was swarmed by Ellata and Arogan, followed by the newly reborn Titan Tribe.\nAlthough the Titan Bone Golem was no longer active, there was no way that the Titans, who’d been reborn, would return to their original forms; they all remained in their elite forms. They were no longer weakened.\n\"I told you, I’m not a Titan. Look, this is the Titan you worship. This thing.\" [1]\nLee Shin Woo instantly re-equipped his equipment, and then brought the core before the deeply bowing Giants. However, their attitude didn’t change in the least. Arogan, who was the only one amongst them that had evolved into a Bone Titan Knight, slightly raised his head and spoke respectfully.\n[Paul Zero, you have not only resurrected the Titan, but you have become the Titan yourself. That is enough for us. Us Titans will always follow you, Paul Zero.]\n\"...Right.\"\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo knew that this was how it would turn out from the very beginning. Well, at least when he’d figured out that the Titan that they worshipped was actually a golem. However, he sported an expression that seemed to say ’Well, if that’s how you feel, then it can’t be helped’, and nodded his head seriously.\n\"Alright then. I can’t always maintain that Titan form, but I can make it so that you can remain as the powerful Titan Tribe.\"\n[It’s an honor!]\nArogan was the first to bow his head and soon after the other Titans followed suit. That was the beginning. They, who had hidden in the depths of the Giants’ domain for their own safely... as well as those who had originally been part of Metafel’s corps bowed their heads before him.\n[Sir Paul Zero!]\n[We’ll follow you forever as well!]\n[Please allow us to accompany you, even from the rear while you do your great work!]\nMm, as expected, turning into and moving around as a Titan had a huge impact on them. After all, the best way to achieve absolute loyalty was a show of absolute force.\n\"I already know how loyal you guys are. Even if you don’t bow like that, I won’t abandon you.\"\n\"Hoo, Paul Zero is so cool...\"\n\"...Well, I suppose right now he is.\"\nKratia said, and Jin bitterly nodded his head. Lee Shin Woo stood in the center of hundreds of Titans (who had been reborn as elites), as well as thousands of undead soldiers who maintained military discipline and prostrated before him, and looked them over; there was no way that sight could not be cool.\nOf course, all of his bowing troops were undead, and Lee Shin Woo was undead as well, so he seemed more like a great demon rather than a general.\n\"You all did well, so make sure you rest. Ah, Shino Rendu, come forward.\"\n[Yes, Sir Paul Zero.]\nShino Rendu stood before him calmly. Lee Shin Woo briefly sighed and spoke.\n\"I promised you that I’d let you cut off his head, but I couldn’t keep my promise. Sorry.\"\n[Please don’t worry about it. He didn’t even have a head left to cut off. I’m happy that I could at least get a good hit in.]\nIt seemed like he was talking about that time when he had stood in front of Lee Shin Woo and hit Metafel in the groin. Not only was it a surprising attack, but his attack began Metafel’s transformation into a true monster... He supposed those were the end days for a man who’d lost ’it’!\n\"Still, a promise is a promise. So instead, I have something to give to you.\"\n[I’m sorry...?]\nLee Shin Woo extended his hand towards the place Metafel had fallen. It seemed that because Metafel had been a level 8 when he had died, he had left much more loot than Hansen Von Dorthe. Amongst the loot, there was one thing that caught his eye...\n[Lucky Strike! You have acquired 96,661,210 Perium.]\nHe’d acquired about 100 million Perium. Lee Shin Woo and Jin had a total of 100 million Perium before, but killing Metafel had garnered another 100 million for them. Thɪs chapter is updatᴇd by N0veI.Fiɾe.net\nConsidering the fact that Perium was clearly another source of karma, the Lucky Strike skill he’d learned was definitely not normal. However, that wasn’t what was important right now...\n[You have acquired the Bayran inner map.]\nWait, he’d definitely gotten the Bayran inner map when he had killed Hansen! To think he’d get a duplicate item; there was nothing worse! But when he caught a glimpse of the map, it seemed like the map possessed a bit of a different shape, so Lee Shin Woo told himself that he’d go over it later and went on to the rest of the loot.\n[You have acquired Lv8 Eater Metafen Rerdan’s tongue bone.]\n[You have acquired Lv8 Eater Metafen Rerdan’s frontal bone.]\n’Now that’s what I’m talking about!’. To think that he’d get two bones here. With just this, Lee Shin Woo thought that it had been the right decision to kill Metafel. Therefore, he was able to overcome this ordeal with just a feeling of heartburn.\nLee Shin Woo grabbed the more disgusting of the two bones, the one which clearly held the essence of Metafel as an Eater, rather than the Mercenary King, the tongue bone.\n\"...Come close.\"\nLee Shin Woo called for Shino, trying his hardest to conceal his heartburn. Shino, who was well acquainted with Lee Shin Woo’s Bone Reinforcement skill, was extremely surprised that Lee Shin Woo called for him.\n[Sir Paul Zero, you’re not...]\n\"It’s something you’ll need to complete your revenge. You’re not going to refuse, are you?\"\n[I... May I really receive this?]\n\"All you need to do is accept it.\"\nThe moment he said that, Shino sported an indescribable expression. He was probably deeply moved. The others nearby who looked on seemed inspired as well.\nTo be honest, Lee Shin Woo would have to fight stronger and stronger opponents from this point forward, so he needed to get Shino Rendu, who acted as his unit commander, to reach level 7 as soon as possible. That’s why he offered the level 8 bone to him. He was unique, as he possessed the Super Regeneration skill, as well as a herculean strength vested in his right arm; abilities which no one else had. The higher his level, the better a job he could do.\n[If you insist, then... I’ll accept it.]\n\"Good. However, it’ll be tough, so you’ll have to endure it.\"\n[I’m well aware of the danger, but I’ll be alright. My instincts as an Avenger are telling me that.]\nWas that really reliable? There was no greater revenge than absorbing the bone of the target of one’s revenge. Lee Shin Woo had never used Bone Reinforcement on someone with a bone two levels higher than them, but he thought Shino would be ok.\nMoreover, if he gained the additional karma held within, then Shino would grow immensely.\n\"Good, then take it.\"\nLee Shin Woo activated Bone Reinforcement immediately. The mana in its entirety went into Shino Rendu. At that moment, Shino yelled, but he soon closed his eyes and focused on accepting the power.\n[Consuming Lv8 Eater Metafel Rerdan’s tongue bone to execute Bone Reinforcement on Shino Rendu. Health and Magic have increased by 20. The Absorption skill has become Lv8. Magic has increased by 10.]\nAs expected, level 8 bones were different from the rest. He used that bone to reinforce someone else, yet his stats increased by 40! Plus, his Absorption skill had grown as well, so he naturally smiled bitterly.\n[Kuhaaahk...!]\nSo what would’ve happened to Shino Rendu, who absorbed such an amazing bone? He was tormented by the overflowing black mana, and grabbed a hold of it with his strong will. The Eater’s lunacy, which was instilled into his brain, was forcefully burned away with his own mana, as if it were thrown into fire.\nThe karma he’d been bestowed as an Avenger was complete, and in the process of accepting a new and more powerful karma... he finally evolved into a level 7.\n[The Lv6 Undead Avenger Shino Rendu has evolved into the Lv7 Greedy Avenger.]\nOh, he didn’t have his hopes up, but... had had gained a portion of the Ghoul’s predatory abilities? Since Shino Rendu had become a ’Greedy’ Avenger.\nThere wasn’t much change to his outer appearance, but it felt like his already tough body had become even tougher. Especially his right arm, which contained God’s power, as it felt like the power hung around the arm even more clearly than before. It screamed ’bad guy’ energy, but Lee Shin Woo was sure that Shino Rendu had acquired the essence of the Eater karma from the bone.\n\"How do you feel? You can do well from now on, right?\"\n[...It’s the best.]\nShino Rendu, who had finished leveling up, replied joyfully.\n[With my newfound power... I will help you kill all the 12 generals, as well as the Emperor. No, I’ll continue to follow you even after, wherever you go.]\n\"There’s probably nothing past that, but... Alright. You did good.\"\nNow, aside from his golem corps, all of his Corps Commanders were level 7s. Lee Shin Woo absorbed the last remaining bone. He turned around to see if Jin was interested, but he just shook his head.\nHonestly, he’d turned around to see that very reaction... He grinned, grabbed the bone, and activated Bone Reinforcement on himself.\n[Consuming Lv8 Eater Metafel Rerdan’s frontal bone to execute Bone Reinforcement. Strength has increased by 40, Agility by 25, Health by 50, and Magic by 35. The High Rank Command skill has become Lv5, and all stats have increased by 10.]\nAs he thought, he gained a ridiculous amount of stats from absorbing a level 8 bone himself. Now he could understand how he could gain 40 stats from using Bone Reinforcement on someone else.\nLee Shin Woo kept nodding his head, and then, calmed down the mana that was furiously rotating with him. At the same time, he also organized the information that flowed through his mind and... in the process, gained one good memory.\n\"Bayran... It’s the most advanced huge city and a level 4 danger zone directly connected to the capital. It’s essential that we attack there to access the capital.\"\nThe two maps he’d acquired told him where the city was. As well as the significance behind that city.\n[1] E/N: The Titan, and the Titans are different. Though it may be confusing, THE Titan is Lee Shin Woo’s Gundam Titan Bone Golem while the Titans (emphasizes the S) is the tribe that was formerly the Giants... or as system-ssi said: [Sealed Titan Zombie]s.",

    "content": "<Chapter 34. Heaven Defying General - 2>\nMetafel had left behind other loot aside from the bones, like a red, flame tinged greatsword. The blade was both wide and long and looked quite crude, but its sharpness and its sinister aura could instill fear upon any who looked upon it.\n[Eater’s Flame Greatsword]\n[Lv6]\n[Durability: 2,350/2,350]\n[Attack Power: 1,400 - 1,950]\n[Element: Fire Lv6]\n[Options: Strength + 70, Magic + 40]\n[Special Passive Skill: Fire Eater - Absorbs all fire-related energy.]\n[Special Active Skill: Countercurrent - Once it reaches the maximum capacity, the fire energy is concentrated in a single point, amplified, and discharged.]\n’Why did an Eater, who didn’t use fire, drop a level 6 fire artifact,’ Lee Shin Woo wondered, but once he looked through the artifact’s skills, he understood.\nFire Eater. Lee Shin Woo recalled Metafel, unable to give up on eating the flames until the very end. His regrets and his will were instilled in this artifact, so it seemed obvious that the item would be so extraordinary.\n\"I got a weapon I can use when I’m a Titan.\"\n\"I’d like to see you use it, but we’ll have to wait another 60 days before you can.\"\n\"I’m scared that you’ll get to level 8 within those 60 days, Shin Woo. Aren’t your stats close to 9,000 now?\"\n\"Even if I become level 8, it doesn’t change the fact that the Titan’s a powerful weapon. And if we can remodel it, then...\"\n\"I’m most scared of the fact that you didn’t deny that you would hit level 8 within those 60 days!\"\nLee Shin Woo grinned and calmly absorbed the greatsword. His strength and magic went up, and the Eater’s Flame Greatsword was recorded in his Bone Armory.\nHe thought his Bone Armory would level up with this, but it seemed like that was still out of his reach. As expected, leveling a skill to level 10 must be special. He pondered that thought, turned around, and declared.\n\"Let’s get out of this mountain range now. There’s no reason for us to stay here any longer.\"\n[Yes sir!]\nThe ice curse had been released. As time passed, the ice would slowly melt, and the mana’s spatial distortions would gradually go away as well. ...And if that happened, the Archmage would wonder why Metafel hadn’t returned, despite how the situation had changed, and he would probably come here himself.\n’Even if I could summon the Titan again, I think he’s still out of my league.’\nHe didn’t know if he could escape the effects of the Archmage’s spatial magic, even with the Titan. Plus, he couldn’t picture himself landing a telling blow on him either.\nMoreover, he wouldn’t kill him by just crushing his body. Since the container, which held his life force, was hidden away somewhere in the Empire! When Lee Shin Woo considered the fact that he’d have to look for said container, he realized that beating the Archmage was still a ways away.\n’If I want to take him down, then I’ll have to be really prepared. I’ll ask my seniors about it later.’\nOf course, that relied on them overcoming the coming danger first. He lined up his troops, left Perlin Elta, and finally, left the gradually melting glacial mountains.\n[We’re finally leaving this place...]\n[Arogan.]\nThe Giants regretted leaving the mountains, which served as their base while they were dead, but... their meaning of existing lay in Lee Shin Woo, not in the past nor in legends. They knew that if they remained here, all they would feel is misfortune and unhappiness.\n[Don’t look so sad. We’ve become able to step forward into the future! Everyone, raise your weapons! Take out the rocks!]\n[Hoo... Huaaaaaahp!]\nThey put all their regrets into their fists, broke apart the mountains, and followed behind Lee Shin Woo. As expected, the Giants’ strength was truly extraordinary. Their fists shook the ground and the sound of their punches rang through the air. The crumbling snow-covered mountain, the warming snowy fields... Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo felt completely refreshed.\n\"Wait, why are you breaking it?\"\n\"They’re erasing all traces of us being here. It’s best to make it so that the enemy’s both unsure of what happened, as well as making it seem worse than what it really is.\"\n\"The Giants sure are energetic.\"\nJin was shocked and Lee Shin Woo explained the situation. In the midst of that, Kratia was the only one to watch the Giants as they broke the mountains and her eyes shined. It seemed like she’d found the next object to study after the Huginn’s Eye. The magic had lasted for hundreds of years and had transformed them into Giants, so it made sense that she was so interested in them.\n\"If we pick up the right materials, then I think we can make another Titan Golem by using that unique mana pattern.\"\n\"Wait, we just went through all that trouble to restore the Titan, so what do you mean ’make another one’... More importantly, how’s the Huginn’s Eye?\"\n\"Mm, I don’t think I’ve made much progress yet. I brought it with me, so you want to take a look?\"\nKratia brought out the Huginn’s Eye from inside her robes. He didn’t really feel like it had changed visually. However, she explained that she had a lot of success limiting the item to just golems.\n\"That’s not all. I can limit it to living people too, and I can limit to the undead as well. Honestly, I just got there after studying how to limit its targets.\"\n\"If it’s limited to the undead, then too many people will appear on it.\"\n\"I feel like I might be able to limit it to high rank undead, level 7 or higher if everything goes well. If that happens, then I suppose I’ll have to worry about expanding its search range.\"\n\"What!?\"\nTo think they’d be able to limit its search function to only high rank level 7 or higher undead. Aside from Lee Shin Woo and his Paul Zero Corps, then that only left the 12 generals or Steves!\nLee Shin Woo knew that the Huginn’s Eye could differentiate between species, but hadn’t known that it could differentiate between levels as well. Lee Shin Woo was shocked, but Kratia explained that if she could reproduce the heroes’ ability to estimate stats, as well as an ability to gauge the density of mana, then it wouldn’t be too difficult. Wouldn’t that be bordering on God’s domain!?\n[The information network is functioning properly as well. If you remodel me, then I should be able to modify the artifact myself.]\n\"Oooh!\"\nIf that happens, then it would be much more effective than following Arema Steelworker’s movements. Moreover, if he were able to divide it and observe based on the situation, then...!\n\"That’s really cool...\"\n\"I think I can guess what you’re imagining right now, Shin Woo...\"\n\"In any case, we’re still researching on that front, and we’ve made good progress on limiting its range to golems. It’s paramount that we figure out how to use the excess energy to increase the search range, but even if it’s a level 8 item, I don’t think it’ll work just yet. So I’ll add some more materials and remodel it later.\"\nIn the process of restoring the Titan Golem, it seemed like the responsibility of manufacturing the artifact had fallen onto Kratia, as she responded so confidently. She was so trustworthy! ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NovєlFіre.net\nIf he could, he would’ve expressed his happiness to Kratia, but if he did, then Jin, who was preoccupied with Kratia, would get pissed at Lee Shin Woo, so he decided against it.\n\"Then, I’ll leave that to you. Since we’ll probably get a chance to use it in the field soon.\"\n\"You still haven’t contacted that senior?\"\n\"Now that you mention it, I think it’s time I checked.\"\n\"But Shin Woo, are you going to keep bringing them with you?\"\nJin asked. He thought that Lee Shin Woo would’ve sent his troops away once they left the mountain range, but Lee Shin Woo instructed Jin to move slow enough that they could keep up.\n\"Mm, well...\"\n\"I’d really like to start running now...\"\n\"Just wait a little while longer. I’m thinking right now.\"\n\"What about...?\"\nAs if waiting for him to ask, Lee Shin Woo spoke.\n\"I’ve been thinking about this, but I confirmed my suspicions when I accepted a portion of Metafel’s troops and the Giants. ...I can’t keep these guys hidden anymore.\"\n\"...Yeah, that’s true.\"\nMetafel’s defected troops numbered 3,000, and each and every Giant really stood out. Because they weren’t golems, the Giants had to live with their large size, as they had no means of miniaturizing their bodies.\n\"I made these guys move around in small teams thus far as an investment, but I have too many troops for that to be a viable option anymore. Even so, I can’t just keep them holed up in a safe base. If I don’t use them, then I’ll be losing out on my investment.\"\n\"So...?\"\n\"I’m going to keep using a few teams of elites like I’ve been doing, and gather the rest of them into a huge army.\"\nThat was quite a rational decision... No, it was actually just a decision he was forced into, as his army had grown too much. Lee Shin Woo knew that this would happen eventually and that’s why he sought an item like Huginn’s Eye.\n\"What if they’re found by a hero?\"\n\"Normally, heroes wouldn’t choose to fight against these guys.\"\n\"Shin Woo, so you realized that you’re not a normal hero yourself...\"\nIf it were Lee Shin Woo, he would’ve agonized over the amount of level 7 elites, but he’d charge in and sew chaos; then, once he’d profited from that, he’d retreat. Lee Shin Woo sweat at Jin’s words but continued.\n\"The problem’s the 12 generals. Because of them, I hid my forces for as long as I could, but... when you think about it the other way, you could bait the 12 generals by commanding such a huge army.\"\n\"Shin Woo, only you could think about it like that.\"\n\"You already killed two of the 12 generals. The other heroes are just cowards.\"\n\"Yeah, that’s right.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s goblin fire intensified. This is what he would look like when he was talking about something serious.\n\"I think that time’s coming soon. When Paul Zero meets with the heroes.\"\n\"You’re going to try?\"\n\"Yeah. Since I’ll have to do it eventually anyway.\"\nHe was still bothered by what Lee Man Bok had told him, but even so, he had to at least try. There was nothing good about maintaining this three-way stalemate for Lee Shin Woo.\n\"But Lee Man Bok concerns had merit, so I’ll have to approach them as cordially as possible.\"\n\"How?\"\n\"As reinforcements.\"\n\"!?\"\nIf an undead suddenly showed up in front of the heroes, who enjoyed such peaceful days, and said ’can I hang out with you too?’, they would definitely look at him with suspicion.\nBut if they were struggling against one of the 12 generals, and his righteous undead army suddenly appeared to save them, then... There wouldn’t be any heroes who would go ’kill them too!’ without thinking, would there? Even if there were, wouldn’t the heroes focus on killing one of the 12 generals first?\n\"If we fight on the same battlefield and on the same side, then it’ll be difficult for them to attack us. And that’s how we’ll gradually change their perception of us.\"\n\"But how are you going to make such a convenient situation for yourself?\"\n\"Normally, it would be hard, but we have Ethan Cruz, now don’t we?\"\n\"...\"\nJin was speechless at Lee Shin Woo’s statement. Kratia silently applauded. They couldn’t even imagine how many problems he hoped to deal with using Ethan Cruz.\n\"We already know how Ethan Cruz thinks. Who knows, he might’ve allied himself with one of the 12 generals already. If that’s the case, then all the more reason for him to put the heroes into a difficult situation. But think about it. That’s when we appear! And what happens when the Paul Zero Corps comes in to save the day?\"\n\"Shin Woo... have you ever lost before?\"\n\"I have. When I was negotiating with God and got stuck in an undead body.\"\n\"...\"\nHonestly, that wasn’t really a negotiation, but more like stubbornness. Lee Shin Woo thought back to that time, calmly assessed himself, and nodded his head.\nBack then, he’d tried his best to remain level-headed, but he had died, he came face to face with God, and he would have to fight against the Empire ruled by the dead as a hero; all these factors overlapped, so he hadn’t been able to stay calm. Thus, he thought he did pretty well back then, all things considered.\n\"It’s a good thing you’re not an enemy, Shin Woo...\"\n\"I feel bad for Ethan Cruz.\"\nWhile Jin and Kratia muttered in the outfield, Lee Shin Woo had made his decision and announced.\n\"So, let’s practice moving as a corps.\"\n\"How?\"\n\"We’re going to attack a level 3 danger zone. Wouldn’t it be cool if we split the army into two and attacked two at the same time?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Why don’t you just split them into five and attack, making them into a cute star or something?\"\n\"Oh, that’s a good idea.\"\n\"...\"\nIt was almost time for the ’Paul Zero Corps’ to spread their name far and wide throughout the Empire.",

    "content": "<Chapter 34. Heaven Defying General - 3>\n[Ethan Cruz: I think I’ve found a target.]\nWhile he and his troops were crossing through the level 3 danger zone, Lee Shin Woo accessed the chatting channel. There, Lee Shin Woo heard what he’d been somewhat prepared to hear.\n[Ethan Cruz: I had it narrowed down to a few candidates. It took a long time to find the one that can be lured in, but I’ve finally found the right one.]\n[Prince Altania: As expected of you, Senior! But it’s boring if it’s too easy.]\n[Ethan Cruz: We’re taking on one of the 12 generals. Even if he’s the weakest of them, it’s not going to be easy. If you’re reckless, then you or I may die.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: ...I’ve done a lot of prep. I’ve also steeled myself. I think it’s time we reveal ourselves (the heroes) to the Empire.]\nThe heroes in the chatting channel were getting fired up by Ethan’s declaration. However, not everyone thought favorably of his idea.\n[Seira Von Retadane: Do you really intend on facing one of the 12 generals? They’re not like normal undead. They’re highly intelligent and cooperate with each other. It won’t go as smoothly as you think.]\n[Yasunori Akira: No matter how I think about it, it’s too early. I don’t think those who’ve just become level 7 will be able to properly use their strength.]\n[Ethan Cruz: Oh dear, I’m not trying to force anyone to join me. But if you’re that worried, all the more reason that you, as their seniors, should be participating, no?]\nHow can this be? Seira Von Retadane and Yasunori Akira both plan on throwing away this opportunity? If that’s the case, then that’s more evidence that Ethan Cruz is allied with the Empire! No, if he really was allied with the Empire, then there was a chance that he would lead not one, but two of the twelve generals to them.\n’And what if he brings the Archmage? Is he allied with him?’\nLee Shin Woo recollected how powerful Feotane Von Seldin was and clenched his fist. He couldn’t beat him right now. It was impossible.\nIt was impossible, but... At the very least, he might have a few ways to make him retreat. Yeah, perhaps it was time to try ’that’.\n[Seira Von Retadane: Are you serious? ...I don’t want to lower morale, but please remember what happened in the past. Seven level 7 heroes joined together, but still died. At that time, you, at level 6, were the only one who survived. Ethan Cruz, have you already forgotten?] ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ noveⅼfire.net\nWhile he was formulating complex plans in his head, those opposed to Ethan Cruz’s plan were beginning to give clear reasons for why his plan wouldn’t work.\nWas Seira Von Retadane referring to the group of heroes (that included Lee Man Bok) that attempted to take down the 12 generals? As expected, it seems like she didn’t participate in that expedition. Then again, if she had, then she would’ve known the horrors that Ethan had unleashed. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and Ethan Cruz replied.\n[Ethan Cruz: Of course I remember. That was a huge failure.]\n’Of course it was a huge failure. After all, he’d lost Lee Man Bok, as well as the two Giants,’ Lee Shin Woo thought.\n[Ethan Cruz: That’s why I’ve prepared so much more. I really did my best after that. To the point that I could probably take on one of the 12 generals by myself. It’s because I’m so sure of that that I want to take down one of them with my juniors.]\nWell, of course, he was that strong. If he wasn’t, then he wouldn’t be able to control the other heroes. After all, he’d lost some undead heroes in the past because of his weakness.\n[Ethan Cruz: You know that God’s blessing won’t last forever, right? We have to purify the Empire before then. If not, then... do you not want to take down one of the 12 generals?]\n[Seira Von Retadane: What are you saying?]\n[Ethan Cruz: You already know, don’t you? Retadane.]\n[Yasunori Akira: Hey, are you doubting an ally right now? Stop. I listened quietly, but you went too far.]\n[Ethan Cruz: No, I just wanted to hear the truth from her.]\nAs expected, they were definitely talking about Seagald Von Retadane of the 12 generals. Considering the mood in the chatting channel, half of the heroes knew about Seagald, and the other half didn’t. Lee Shin Woo supposed this was proof that his seniors hadn’t been just playing around thus far.\nThat was a topic that should’ve been difficult to ask her about, so Ethan Cruz was definitely taunting her. So in other words, did that mean he was confident that he could overpower Seira Von Retadane?\n[Seira Von Retadane: ...I want to destroy the undead more than anyone else. Whether it be the 12 generals, the Emperor, or anyone. Regardless of what name they held in the past, or what person they were, so long as they’re undead... I’ll purify them all.]\nShe was just talking in the chatting channel, yet Lee Shin Woo felt goosebumps. Was this what Lee Man Bok was telling him to be cautious of, her hatred of the undead? Now he could understand what he was warning him about.\n[Seira Von Retadane: I suppose your cheap taunt worked. Since I don’t want a repeat of the past. I must stop precious heroes from degenerating into such a cursed form.]\n[Ethan Cruz: You made the right choice. I have high hopes for your power over light.]\nCould Seira Von Retadane use light magic? Lee Shin Woo decided to stow that away for later. Their powers should clash against each other, so the fact that Ethan was willing to taunt her and bring her into this meant that he was just that confident. ...If not, then perhaps he wanted to use this opportunity to take her down, as she was a bothersome opponent.\n’Seira Von Retadane. She’s diligently doing her duty as a hero, so I’d like to keep her alive if at all possible...’\nLee Man Bok warned him that he should avoid her at all cost, but that was way too half-hearted for him. To defeat the Empire, he needed to even use his greatest enemy. Even more so if she were someone who hated the undead to that extent.\n[Ethan Cruz: Akira, what about you?]\n[Yasunori Akira: Don’t talk so casually. It makes me sick. If you really did pick a safe target, then me not going won’t make much of a difference.]\n[Ethan Cruz: You’ll regret it. Our super rookie, Lee Shin Woo, are you almost ready?]\n[Lee Shin Woo: Yes, Senior. I’m making sure I’m prepared, especially for any unforeseen situations.]\nHe was preparing a plan for if Ethan Cruz went onto the frontlines personally, when he didn’t, when his undead grouped together, when he moved stealthily when there were one or two of the 12 generals, or if the Archmage himself appeared!\n[Ethan Cruz: You’re so reliable. As expected of our super rookie!]\n’That reliable super rookie is coming to put a sword in your gut,’ Lee Shin Woo smiled and inwardly muttered.\nBut then, he suddenly got two requests for private chats. They were from both Seira Von Retadane and Yasunori Akira! Lee Shin Woo was flustered and sent a message asking Seira to wait just a second. He accepted Yasunori Akira’s private chat first because he thought he would be easier to deal with.\n[Yasunori Akira: This might sound a little weird, but listen carefully. Can you promise me that?]\n\"Of course, Senior Yasunori.\"\n[Yasunori Akira: I plan on hiding while you guys are fighting against one of the 12 generals.]\n\"What are you talking about... Are you trying to protect me?\"\n[Yasunori Akira: Yeah. I want to protect you guys. ...But not from one of the 12 generals. From Ethan Cruz.]\nEveryone, there’s a hero as reliable as Kratia over here! Lee Shin Woo was touched, as he’d found another hero that tried their best for endless growth and glory!\n[Yasunori Akira: It might sound weird, but I thought it’d be ok to tell you since you haven’t met Ethan yet. Those who meet him, even just once... follow him a bit blindly.]\nLee Shin Woo thought that was most likely due to Ethan Cruz’s darkness magic, but he didn’t voice it.\n[Yasunori Akira: That’s already strange. Even if he were blessed to have so many people willing to help him, it’s still too unnatural. Moreover, this hunt for one of the 12 generals... it’s way too dangerous. Since it’s almost impossible to bait one of the 12 generals.]\nIn the past, Lee Shin Woo had infiltrated a city and had successfully led Hansen Von Dorthe there, but he acted as if it had never happened before.\n[Yasunori Akira: Be wary of him. Don’t get too close. Especially... his buffs. Make sure you reject his buffs. Even if he gives you a good reason, make sure you refuse them. Don’t let yourself get touched by his magic.]\n\"I’ll keep that in mind.\"\n[Yasunori Akira: Do you believe me?]\n\"How could I not believe you, as you’re acting out of concern for me? You’re not telling me to attack him. You’re just telling me to refuse his buffs.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s Acting skill was really paying off. Yasunori Akira was slightly touched by Lee Shin Woo’s sincerity.\n[Yasunori Akira: ...I thought you were only good at fighting, but you’re a smooth talker too. But it makes me feel better if you think like that. Who is that again? That hero you were close to... can you tell her about my request too?]\n\"Yes, of course. I’ll remember to be careful around him.\"\n[Yasunori Akira: I’ll mark you off. I wish everyone was as careful as you, but... if we all make it out of this safely, let’s hunt together.]\n\"I’ll be looking forward to it.\"\nHe’s going to mark him off personally. If that’s the case, then it’s likely that Yasunori Akira was in the most danger... Lee Shin Woo thanked him for his warning, but before he left the chat, he warned Yasunori Akira about the curse that came from Deadly Force. Yasunori was surprised but said he understood.\nNow, it was Seira Von Retadane’s turn now. Lee Shin Woo took a deep breath and accepted a private chat with her.\n[Seira Von Retadane: I heard you became level 7. You were afraid you’d stick out, so you hid your level.]\n\"I’m sorry, Senior. I know I shouldn’t be lying to you, but I was afraid of you (seniors) pinning all your hopes on me...\"\n[Seira Von Retadane: I understand. Since you must’ve been exceptionally talented in your original world. As they say, ’Tall trees catch much wind’. [1] It must’ve been suffocating.]\n\"Senior...\"\nHe acted as though he were touched by her kindness. Lee Shin Woo said pretty much what he’d expected her to say.\n[Seira Von Retadane: Please be careful of Ethan Cruz. On that day, the day that the heroes were wiped out... Why was he the only one that came back alive? I find it quite odd. Perhaps he’s connected with the Empire.]\nHe’d gotten another reliable senior.\n[Seira Von Retadane: I’d rather not even think of that as a possibility, but if he’s really a traitor, then... we have to take him down no matter what. Since an enemy on the inside is more threatening than the 12 generals.]\n\"Senior Yasunori said the same thing.\"\n[Seira Von Retadane: Yasunori Akira did? That’s a relief. Now that I think about it, he’s never met Ethan in person. He’s benefitting from his caution.]\n\"Of course, I’ll be sure to be careful. Thank you for the advice.\"\nHe thought she had said everything she was going to say, but then, she dropped a bombshell.\n[Seira Von Retadane: It can’t be helped. Let’s meet up before you see him. I’ll contact Yasunori Akira as well. Ah, please come with the hero you’re on good terms with too.]\n\"...I’m sorry?\"\n[Seira Von Retadane: I want you to meet me before you’re exposed to his magic. I’d also like to formulate a plan on site as well.]\nHe was doing fine on his own, but she had suddenly offered to meet!\nLee Shin Woo looked miserable, as it was like he was drafted into a team meeting for a presentation for a huge client.\n[Paul Zero, we have arrived at the city!]\n[Apparently, the second corps has arrived at the opposite city! How about attacking before our enemies have a chance to react!?]\nThen, the frontline Giants, who were unaware of how he was feeling, yelled. Lee Shin Woo saw the huge city in front of him and yelled, putting all of his stress from the chatting channel into it.\n\"Break everything and trample over them! Break them into pieces, so that no one can even identify who killed them!\"\n[1] T/N: If you stand out from the crowd, then you draw attention to yourself.",

    "content": "<Chapter 34. Heaven Defying General - 4>\nLike he said, Lee Shin Woo attacked two cities in the danger level 3 zone simultaneously. His goal was to confuse the Emperor, as well as the 12 generals that followed his commands.\nAlthough it was possible that two of the 12 generals could be sent to both cities, Lee Shin Woo was confident that he could finish his attack and retreat before they got there, so it wasn’t really a problem. If the Empire were to be put on guard due to an unknown force, then... Ethan Cruz’s plan either wouldn’t work, or it would have to be altered, which wasn’t bad by any means.\n\"Of course, that’s not the real reason. I just want to use all the strength that I’ve acquired.\"\n\"I’m glad you’re honest.\"\nLee Shin Woo, together with Jin and Kratia, led the Giants and attacked the city. Chi Paul, Shino Rendu, and Bisher Moon led the remaining Pauls and attacked a separate city.\nOf course, he had divided his forces deliberately. On one side, there were the Giants, and on the other side, there were elite undead. There was no better way to sow chaos amongst his enemies. But there was one problem.\n\"It’s too easy...\"\nLee Shin Woo ordered the Giants to attack all at once, saw the castle walls go down in one hit, and smiled bitterly. Because Lee Shin Woo and Kratia had preemptively intercepted the magicians (Thunder Arrow was great for taking down low level magicians), there was nothing to stop the Giants’ head-on assault.\n\"With these forces, I feel like I could easily take down a level 4 danger zone city as well.\"\n\"It’s too dangerous.\"\nIf they went on to the level 4 danger zone, it would be impossible for them to conquer a city and retreat within a few hours. Not only did he have to take into account the higher level undead, but the cities were also huge! Moreover, they were so close to the capital that it wouldn’t be surprising if one of the 12 generals suddenly appeared.\n\"I’ll have to conquer those cities eventually, but it’s not time yet. ...Though I think that that time will come faster than I anticipated.\"\nLee Shin Woo watched as the Giants, who had charged forward, use one hand to break buildings and the other to break the castle, and suddenly realized just how much he’d gained from the Giants’ domain.\nNot only had he recruited 3,000 of Metafel’s troops, but he’d also acquired two level 7 Titan elites and the powerful Titans as his subordinates as well. Although it required a 60 day recharge time, the powerful weapon that increased his strength... the Titan Golem was also the same.\n\"If the Archmage saw it, then he’d be pissed. As I thought, you have to be cautious making big moves in the level 4 danger zone.\"\n[Master, I believe the lord is attempting to run away unnoticed.]\n\"What?\"\nRem reported as he watched the enemies’ movements from the sky, and Lee Shin Woo’s goblin fire swayed. However, he didn’t even move; he simply shot a Breath of the Lightning God far away.\nHe saw the lord running away with a company of knights guarding him by borrowing Rem’s sight. Although the lord was several kilometers away, he precisely controlled the Breath of the Lightning God and pierced his forehead!\n[Kuaaaaahk!]\n\"Good, a direct hit. Jin, let’s take our time.\"\nBefore he even heard the sound from afar, Lee Shin Woo saw, through Rem’s eyes, that his attack had hit. His jawbone rattled, he smiled relaxingly, and patted Jin.\nHe’d been practicing that ultra-long-distance sniper shot lately. Lee Shin Woo would skillfully aim the bone with his will, and after ascertaining the enemy’s location through Rem, he would shoot out a powerful attack!\nIt sounded easy to do, but he and Rem had different viewpoints, so getting a direct hit was difficult. He was, however, getting a lot of training by choosing where to summon the Breath of the Lightning God, as well as increasing his Assimilation with Rem. And this time, he definitely succeeded.\n\"It’d be amazing if I could do it with a huge weapon later on. ...Ha, wait a sec. If I were to send this to Rem’s inventory, then...\"\n\"You just keep making more and more weird techniques.\" For more chapters visıt novelꜰire.net\n\"Paul Zero, you’re so cool.\"\nJin grumbled in amazement, but Kratia’s eyes gleamed, as though she understood just how difficult Lee Shin Woo’s technique was to use. Unfortunately, Jin hadn’t realized that Lee Shin Woo was docking points from him because of this.\n\"Did you kill him?\"\n\"No, I’d like to meet him face to face. I want to know if he reported to his superiors or not. Hey, break that more thoroughly! There are knights hiding inside, so get on top and stomp on it!\"\n[I understand!]\nLee Shin Woo and Jin advanced towards the city in a leisurely manner. He encouraged the Giants, who were unleashing carnage and destruction, and cut across without rushing. In less than an hour, they arrived before the lord, who was lying down with a Breath of the Lightning God sticking out of his head.\nHe was situated in a hidden passageway behind his castle, and Lee Shin Woo’s Breath of the Lightning God had broken through the ceiling and pierced his head. The Giants had taken note of this, and rushed over, killing the knights that had been protecting the lord.\n\"Hello.\"\n[You... I order you to remove this!]\nLee Shin Woo approached the lord, who was fluttering around like a fish who’d been struck by a harpoon, and as he wished, removed the blade. He struggled to upright his body, but a part of his skull fell to the floor and he was staggering. The lord had realized that he had no hopes of recovering.\n[Do you even know who I am... Who the hell are you!?]\n\"Look here, did you ask the Emperor to send one of the 12 generals?\"\n[Keuk, you already knew about that, yet you attacked the city regardless? Are you insane...? That’s right, the moment you broke through the castle walls, I reported in! The Vulture General will be coming!]\n\"Vulture...?\"\nA Vulture. [1] He was definitely one of the 12 generals, but the word ’Vulture’ really bothered him. There was the possibility that it just meant that he had a bald head, but... perhaps he was the second opponent (after the Archmage) that they would have to worry about.\n\"It would be different if Feotane Von Seldin came, but I’m not particularly afraid of him.\"\n[Hahaha. I’ve seen so many that said the same thing about the general. But they all had their heads cracked out by the Vulture General’s arrows!]\n\"Oh, like you?\"\n[Keuk...!]\nFor now, he knew that the Vulture General used a bow. Lee Shin Woo was taught just how annoying archers were from his previous experience with Setoin. He furrowed his brow, raised his head, and looked at the sky. He couldn’t stop worrying, so he asked the lord about him...\n[Kik, you’re so arrogant. It seems like you’re afraid of the general’s sharp wings!]\n\"Ah, so that’s how it is.\"\n[Huh? Kuheok!]\nThe lord had taken the bait. Although he didn’t know the specifics, his opponent flew in the air! Lee Shin Woo had gotten the answer he’d wanted, so he immediately swung his sword and cut off the lord’s head.\n[You have completely purified the Intermediate City, ’Semillan’! You have acquired 2 permits to God’s secret shop. You have acquired 100,000 Perium. Proficiency in all combat-related skills has increased. As a reward for faithfully doing your duty as a hero and purifying several cities, the size of your inventory has increased, and from now on, all quest rewards will increase.]\n[You have completely purified a city at an unprecedented speed! Destroying a city with a corps is karma much too great for one person to achieve. All stats have increased by 5.]\n\"With this, we’re done. An air strike, huh...?\"\n\"Is that what you thought of when you heard the word ’vulture’?\"\n\"To be honest, the first thing I thought of was a bald head.\"\nThat’s right. To Lee Shin Woo, who had an army now and had leveled up to level 7, the only things he had to worry about were the Archmage Feotane Von Seldin and his spatial magic, or an air strike from the sky.\nAs proven by Rem, flying through the sky granted much more utility than moving on the ground. He thought that the Empire would have something like this, but to think that his hypothesis would be proven this way. Moreover, to think he’s coming now of all times.\n\"To fight, or not to fight... Alright, let’s fight.\"\n\"Didn’t you decide too fast!?\"\nJin, who’d heard Lee Shin Woo mutter, felt drained. However, Lee Shin Woo didn’t change his stance at all.\n\"Although fighting a flying opponent is tough, it’s best if I take him down while he’s alone.\"\nBut he didn’t have enough forces with him. Lee Shin Woo contacted Bisher Moon and instructed him to gather all his forces here as soon as they were done purifying the city.\nBut once he relayed that order, he got a message that they had finished purifying the city, followed by a list of rewards. There was one thing that he took notice of.\n[You commanded an army and purified two cities simultaneously. You have proven that you are powerful enough to single-handedly take on the Empire. Everyone in the Empire, including the Emperor himself, will know about you and will pay special attention to you.]\n[You have acquired the title, ’Heaven Defying General’. All stats have increased by 20. The High Rank Command skill has become Lv6 and all stats have increased by 5. When you fight against the Empire’s 12 generals, the power of all your skills will increase by 20%. The stats of your troops permanently increase by 5%.]\nHe’d acquired an extraordinary title and simultaneously, his stats had increased significantly! Lee Shin Woo, whose stats had surpassed 9,000 (they were now at 9,086), was slightly excited.\n\"Ah, wait a sec. If I had only divided my army into five groups and made a cute star, then...!\"\n\"No matter how strong your troops are, splitting them into five is a dumb idea, you idiot!\"\nLee Shin Woo was barely able to calm down due to Jin’s retort and cool-headedly checked his new title. Whenever he fought against the 12 generals, his skills would become 20% more powerful, which was simple enough, but when he thought about it, it was even more hacked than a 20% stat increase.\nRather than raising his stats, raising the power of his skills, which used those stats and amplified them, was obviously superior. Because of that, his elemental equipment would become more powerful as well.\n\"What system bestowed this title onto me...?\"\n\"Didn’t God give it to you?\"\n\"No. It’s not that simple. It seems more like it’s been influenced by something...\"\nThe Heaven Defying General. It was a title that really fit him, as he possessed the Rebellion skill. But he wondered if he was considered an ally of the 12 generals because of the term ’general’ in his name.\n\"So long as I don’t talk about it, it should be fine. Alright boys, get ready for battle. Apparently, he flies in the sky, so make a catapult!\"\n[Understood!]\n\"Hey, will a catapult really work against a flying opponent?\"\n\"It’ll definitely work. Want to make a bet?\"\n\"...Nope.\"\nJin was about to accept, but when he saw the Giants begin to make a 30 meter tall catapult by stripping the castle walls, he shook his head.\nThey soon created dozens of those monstrously sized catapults, but strangely, that air strike they were waiting for didn’t appear for several hours.\n[1] T/N: This can mean ’eagle’ as well.

    "content": "<Chapter 34. Heaven Defying General - 5>\nLee Shin Woo gritted his teeth at the frustration welling up within him.\n\"That bastard, did he lie to me...?\"\n\"They might’ve gotten two calls for help at the same time, so they might be confused.\"\nKratia said persuasively. Lee Shin Woo accepted it, nodded his head, and said.\n\"...Yeah, they’ll probably be here soon. Let’s just get everything that’s hidden here.\"\n\"Over here, Shin Woo.\"\nThey were in the midst of looking for any hidden artifacts or Perium within the castle while using Rem as covertly as possible to keep watch.\n\"It’s all been useless stuff.\"\n\"Yeah, but it was still a strong reaction. Ah, this is it.\"\nThey found a discretely hidden storage house within the castle. Upon analyzing and opening it, they found a huge quantity of Perium inside. To be exact, it contained 25 million Perium. It was a significant sum of money, but Lee Shin Woo wasn’t excited in the least from such a ’small’ sum. He asked her if she wanted him to split it into three parts and give her 8.4 million, but Kratia just shook her head.\n\"Kratia, are you studying Perium?\"\n\"I haven’t started on that yet. Moreover, Perium didn’t exist in my original world.\"\n\"Really?\"\nApparently, levels and skills existed in Kratia’s original world surprisingly. If that’s the case, then did that mean that this world was more developed than her own world? If not, then was the reverse true? Kratia replied simply to the inquisitive Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Surplus, incalculable karma comes in the form of Perium. In other words, you would receive karma in a different form in a different world. It’s not better or worse than any other worlds’ karma.\"\n\"Surplus karma, huh...\"\nLee Shin Woo stored the Perium and muttered. Surplus karma. It was through this surplus karma that Shino Rendu gained new equipment. In other words, Perium responded to Shino Rendu’s new karma and had the ability to change. If Lee Shin Woo was able to control the direction it changes in, then...\n[Master.]\nWhile Lee Shin Woo was thinking about how he would approach Perium, Rem reported to him. It was information regarding the long-awaited enemy forces.\n[I see a giant flying monster from afar. It’s moving incredibly fast and there was an undead riding on top of it.]\n\"Oooooh!\"\nA Monster Rider had appeared! Lee Shin Woo hadn’t seen any monster riders, aside from some goblins riding atop wolves, so there was no way he wouldn’t be excited at the news.\n\"Jin!\"\n\"No matter how hopeful you sound, I’m not going to sprout wings.\"\n\"You can’t make them? After all, you made springs out of steel.\"\n\"I can’t!\"\nWell, even if he could make wings out of steel, Jin wouldn’t be able to fly in the sky. After all, Steel Wing was an attack move in Pokemon.\n\"You’ve given me pretty much all of the flying monster bones thus far, yet nothing has happened. Give it up already.\"\n\"Tch... Rem, how’s it going over there?\"\n[It’s strange. There’s only one coming over here. It seems like a scout. What would you like me to do?]\nIt was easy to forget, but Rem was a level 6 elite. Although it was focused on support skills that relied on stealth, Lee Shin Woo had reinforced it with thousands of bones, so it now possessed combat abilities befitting its level. Taking down a scout wouldn’t be an issue for Rem.\n\"A scout... Alright, take it down.\"\n[Understood.]\nNothing good would come of their opponent getting info on them before they even fought. Lee Shin Woo ordered Rem to take it down, following which Rem charged forward, piercing through the monster’s body while maintaining its stealth.\n[Kuhahk!?]\nLee Shin Woo watched as the flying monster’s corpse, as well as the undead riding atop it, fell from the sky and shot one of his floating swords at it. He’d hit the mark, of course.\n\"What will they do now? Will they send more scouts, or will they just attack us right away? How exciting.\"\nThey probably didn’t know that Lee Shin Woo had already been aware of their scout and that he’d intercepted it. Lee Shin Woo imagined the Vulture General’s flustered expression and grinned, and then leisurely collected the flying monster and the scout’s corpses.\n\"You’re going to give me that bone, aren’t you?\"\n\"You never know. Take it. Think of it as taking a tonic.\"\n\"I told you, I’m not going to sprout wings...\"\nLee Shin Woo gave Jin both the flying monster’s bone, as well as the scout’s bone. He was acting like a test-taker who sent in his application to Seoul University, despite knowing that he wouldn’t get in. [1]\nHowever.\n\"Huh...?\"\n\"What is it? Are your shoulder joints feeling itchy?\"\n\"No, that’s not it.\"\nJin said and looked embarrassed. Lee Shin Woo looked on in anticipation, as though he was absolutely sure that it had worked this time, but unfortunately, it hadn’t worked out this time either.\n\"Stop deluding yourself and just focus on the coming battle, you dumbass.\"\n\"Damn it, I guess it didn’t work this time either...\"\n30 minutes passed. Lee Shin Woo stationed the Giants in front of the catapults, and the level 7 elite, Ellata, was prepared to shoot herself into the air with her ability to manipulate the earth.\n[Arogan, you’re ready, right?]\n[Of course I am... They’re really making us wait...]\nThey’d even formed a plan that involved shooting Arogan into the air. Once he was there, he would taunt the enemy forces, acting like a magnet to pull a large number of them down to the ground.\n[Master, they’ve arrived.]\n[We’ve come as you’ve commanded, Sir Paul Zero!]\nThe Pauls arrived after completing their mission. Lee Shin Woo ordered them to prepare for aerial warfare as well. If need be, Lee Shin Woo would Instigate their flying mounts to control them.\n’The Vulture General, huh. Is he going to be level 7 or level 8? If he’s level 7, then there’s nothing to be afraid of. But if he’s level 8, then we’ll probably struggle a bit... Even so, it doesn’t feel like we’ll lose. Even if the unexpected happens, we should win with our current forces.’\nOf course, he wasn’t reckless and prepared everything that he could for the coming battle. The seven fully charged Breath of the Lightning Gods sparked, as though waiting for the moment that Lee Shin Woo would shoot them out.\n\"Ugh, my Lightning Resistance is going up again.\"\n\"But seriously, when are they going to be here?\"\nDespite their scout being dead for close to an hour now, he didn’t see anyone in the sky. There was no way that the scout was so far from the main force that it would take them an hour to get there, and it would make sense if there was another scout or a follow-up squad sent in after, yet the sky was empty.\n\"They’re not traveling underground while acting as though they’re coming from the air, are they?\"\n\"I looked just in case, but I don’t see any signs of that.\"\nKratia looked perplexed and tilted her head. At that moment, their second scout appeared. They knew that their previous scout had been taken out, yet they sent one that looked similar and was also similarly leveled!\nLee Shin Woo was speechless and ordered Rem to intercept the scout.\n\"The hell are they doing? Are they looking down on... Huh?\"\n[Keeeeehk!]\nBut the moment the scout helplessly fell from the sky, Lee Shin Woo realized that he’d made a mistake. The scout knew it was going to die, yet it held a crystal ball close to its chest.\n\"Heup!\"\nLee Shin Woo thought it was some sort of communication line, so he immediately shot out one his swords and destroyed it. The moment it shattered, he belatedly wondered whether it was some sort of explosive item and regretted it, but fortunately, it wasn’t. While it wasn’t a communication line like he’d first thought it was, Kratia knew what it was upon collecting a piece of the crystal ball.\n\"This is... a visual transmitter.\"\nIt was a term he was unfamiliar with, but the moment he heard it, he recalled something.\n\"Does it transmit an image of what is observed?\"\n\"Yeah. It’s way more expensive than a communication line, and because it’s a one-way street, it’s not used very often. However, when it’s difficult to relay something in words, there’s nothing better than an image, so there’s still a demand for it. Honestly, I didn’t think a scout would carry around such a precious item...\"\n\"And by sacrificing that transmitter, the enemy knows the condition of our troops...\"\nLee Shin Woo smiled bitterly. As expected, it was indeed a different world from the one he knew. He thought he’d gotten used to it here, but he hadn’t expected this surveillance method to have existed.\nOf course, they had intercepted the scouts from afar, but they must’ve seen his army and relayed it back to them, so the scouts had indeed fulfilled their duty. He should’ve destroyed the transmitter or whatever right when he saw it, but he was being punished for being so laidback when he saw that there was only one scout.\n\"There’s a jammer that blocks this type of artifact, but only countries’ governments use them. The fact that they’re able to use image transmitters means that... there might be a jammer in the capital.\"\n\"Then does that mean we can’t use Huginn’s Eye?\"\n\"Huginn’s Eye is a level 8 artifact, so most jammers won’t be able to stop it. Especially if we limit its range and increase its output. Then, there shouldn’t be any way for them to block it.\"\nGood. Then, they got him good this time, but he would pay them back by using Huginn’s Eye later. Lee Shin Woo thought he would need to learn more about the types of magical devices from Kratia and turned around.\nThey were finished scouting, so they would come at him in some way or another. Now was not the time to be angry; now he should be encouraging his troops and perfecting his preparation for the coming conflict.\n\"...But why aren’t they coming?\"\nThree more hours passed. Lee Shin Woo wondered whether he was wasting his time. They flew in the air, so why the hell were they so slow? Were they getting a feel for him right now? Were they waiting for his troops to be exhausted from their preparation?\n\"They should already know that our forces are comprised of the undead, so they should already know about their endurance. ...And there’s no way they know I’m a hero.\"\nAlthough Kratia was the only human here, she was not only covered in robes, but she was also hiding her energy well. As she was buried in the undead, it would be difficult for them to determine that she was a human just by seeing an image of her. Lee Shin Woo couldn’t comprehend what they were doing and tilted his head.\n\"What should we do? Should we just keep waiting?\"\n\"...No, they’re not going to show up, even if we keep waiting. They’re either waiting for us to slack off, or they want to move somewhere else. Either way, just staying here won’t accomplish anything. ...Let’s go.\"\n\"Go where?\"\n\"Here.\"\nLee Shin Woo opened his minimap and pointed to a single point in a level 3 danger zone. It wasn’t very far from here, and of course, it was situated in the Intermediate City, so heroes wouldn’t be there. At the same time...\n\"If they don’t move, then we’ll just have to go around breaking stuff. We’ll go from here, all the way to here... We’ve already conquered two cities, so let’s make it our primary goal to conquer five total. If we do that and they still don’t show up, then they must not have come to fight us.\"\n\"Shin Woo, this...\" ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ novel_fіre.net\n\"Yeah.\"\nThe five dots that Lee Shin Woo had marked on his minimap (of those five, two of them had already been conquered) were connected, and he solemnly declared.\n\"In order to draw them in, we’ll conquer five cities in the shape of a cute star.\"\nBut was Lee Shin Woo expecting too much?\nThey had gone around and destroyed the three cities without even concealing their presence (With an army this size, even if he tried, he wouldn’t be able to conceal them. Even if they were unlucky enough to encounter a hero, he hoped that they wouldn’t attack, so long as they didn’t look back at them). Then, Lee Shin Woo’s Commander of Terror title evolved into Commander of Fear (the abilities of all the subordinates under his command would increase by 15%), and after purifying the cities, he gained permits to God’s secret shop, stat bonuses, and more money. However...\n\"Why the hell aren’t they coming yet!?\"\n\"Wow, it really is in the shape of a cute star!\"\n\"Kratia... No, never mind.\"\nIn the end, he never clashed with the Vulture General’s forces.\n[1] T/N: Seoul University is considered one of the best universities in South Korea.",

    "content": "<Chapter 34. Heaven Defying General - 6>\nDid everything go as Lee Shin Woo wanted? Well yes, yes it did. Since Lee Shin Woo’s original goal was to shock the Vulture General and clear as many cities as possible without incident.\n\"Ha, in the end, that bald-headed bastard didn’t come.\"\n\"You really are too much. You don’t even know if he’s bald or not yet.\"\n\"So why the hell did he scout us out if he wasn’t going to come? Man, this pisses me off.\"\n\"You said not encountering him was a good thing.\"\n\"...Yeah, I did, but...\"\nBut if he was being honest, Lee Shin Woo wanted to take down one of the 12 generals prior to hunting another one with the other heroes. Regardless of whether the Empire reacts strongly or weakly to the news, the heroes should be able to deal with the situation better.\n...And there was one other thing he wanted.\n\"Since I gain two permits to the secret shop for every city I clear... Tch, I’ve only gathered 10 more.\"\n\"Hey, you took mine too, so you have 15 total.\"\n\"Yeah, you’re right. So let’s take a look...\"\nAny hero who helped take down one of the 12 generals would be rewarded, regardless of how much or how little they did. On the other hand, killing undead heroes or clearing cities was different.\nFor the former, Jin wouldn’t receive any reward, but for the latter, he would receive a single permit. It was the same for Kratia as well.\n\"I have a total of 75 permits.\"\n\"75!?\"\nKratia, who quietly listened in, was shocked. It would be difficult for the other heroes to even accumulate 10 permits, yet here he was with 75!\nHowever, there were three reasons Lee Shin Woo was able to gather these permits so quickly. First, killing undead heroes (most of his seniors didn’t have any experience in this). Secondly, purifying cities (even if his seniors partied up, it was difficult for them to purify an entire city, and most importantly, they were worried that it would cause trouble in the future, so they didn’t easily attempt level 3 danger zones and up). Thirdly, killing the 12 generals (his seniors hadn’t killed one).\n\"They’re all things that would be difficult for my seniors...\"\n\"Since you’ve hunted one of the 12 generals and purified cities with me, you should have more secret shop permits than our seniors.\"\n\"Yeah. I was thinking about going to God’s garden again to get another artifact soon, but I’ve been putting it off since I can’t think of anything that fits. ...Still, the fact that you have 75 of them is amazing.\"\nLee Shin Woo thought he’d be able to gather more permits than the other heroes if he put his mind to it, but to think he’d accumulated this many... One of the reasons behind this was the fact that Jin gave him his permits.\n\"But it’s important to note that nothing has changed, even though I’ve gathered so many.\"\n\"Should there be some sort of change?\"\n\"If what God told me is true, then yeah...\"\nHe had a feeling when he had first gathered 10 permits. Not only did he get a message, but he could feel these permits, these shards of God’s power, shake. It was as if these tiny fragments would fuse into something greater... Yeah. To put it in words, it felt similar to a level up.\n\"Then... If you amass 100 of them, will something change?\"\n\"So you think something will happen too, huh.\"\n100 secret shop permits. He was too embarrassed to even ask his seniors about this. It would be impossible to gather so many of them if one didn’t either kill the 12 generals or actively clear out cities. One would have to be Lee Shin Woo to even try it.\n\"It’d be chaos if I asked them what’ll happen if I gather 100. I’d rather not.\"\n\"They probably won’t know anyway.\"\n\"Yeah, this is probably impossible for Ethan Cruz.\"\nWhat would happen when one collected 100 secret shop permits? He had some idea, but he decided against thinking about it right now. Lee Shin Woo would be able to gather the remaining 25 permits quickly, so he would just need to check then and there.\n\"Well, that’s that. We need to figure out what we do from here on out.\"\n\"Are you going to attack another city?\"\n\"Cities aren’t monsters, so do they just form out of nowhere? Do they regenerate?\"\nThe undead wouldn’t occupy purified cities. Killing all of the undead wouldn’t purify a city. God would personally shine her power upon a purified city.\nGiving permits to heroes who have purified a city shouldn’t be unrelated to that phenomenon, but in any case, low rank undead were afraid of Her power and the high rank undead would be leery of the city and avoid it.\n\"And for a long time, our seniors hadn’t tried to purify the cities. There are only two or three more level 3 danger zone cities left. The fact that it’s not over after I’ve wreaked so much havoc tells me just how powerful the Empire is.\"\n\"Then let’s go take them out.\"\n\"...Let’s leave the rest of them as leftovers for our juniors.\"\n\"Leftovers?\"\nJin and Kratia tilted their heads, but Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and looked away from their inquisitive gazes. It sounded good, leaving a few cities in the level 3 danger zone for his juniors, but it was actually because taking out all of the cities would provoke the Empire more than he thought necessary.\nMost of the heroes were operating in the level 3 danger zone, and aside from his elites forces, his Pauls were in the level 3 danger zone as well. Honestly, he was being bold enough. A person needs to know when to stop.\n\"Honestly, that’s not the only reason. ...You see, tomorrow’s the day I have to see Seira.\"\n\"Do we both have to see her?\"\n\"Yeah. I know you avoid the other heroes, but just come with me this time. It feels reassuring to have you with me.\"\n\"If you’re really that insistent, then...\"\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t really concerned with what Seira’s intentions were, or what she was doing to prepare for Ethan Cruz’s plan. That’s because Lee Shin Woo was already on top of it.\nHe just wanted to meet with her since Lee Man Bok’s words were still bothering him. That was why he was dragging Kratia with him.\n\"Then, I suppose I should hide my troops before we go.\"\n[Giants do not hide!]\n\"The Titan hides for 60 days to be active for just 4 minutes.\"\n[If that’s what the Titan desires, then we’ll swallow our pride!]\nFiguring out where his forces should hide (when he wasn’t leading them) was his first problem. He couldn’t manage them individually, especially since they were split up and moving independently, so he needed a place to station them.\nHowever, the answer was right in his face: a dungeon. Dungeons were, by their very nature, secretive, and they could hide several undead. Also, Lee Shin Woo and Kratia could take protective measures on them, like they had done for the Kerr Century Winery.\nSo which dungeon should he pick? Would he just do as Lee Man Bok did and just pick any random dungeon, and hide it by covering it in mana or magic? No, that was the reason Lee Man Bok died a second time. He couldn’t ridicule his choice and then copy him.\nThe dungeon Lee Shin Woo had picked was...\n[Level 3 dungeon - You have discovered the Darkness Hidden Sewer’s hidden path. The dungeon’s information is updated.]\n[Level 4 elite dungeon - You have acquired the permit for the Darkness Hidden Sewer. All stats increase by an additional 10 inside the dungeon. The dungeon’s information is added to your minimap. All actions are buffed within the dungeon.]\n\"They all got out of here too.\"\n\"Seems like you were right. The higher the danger zone, the higher the Pauls’ intellect, and the higher chance that their tests succeeded, so... they join up with Anti-Skull immediately.\"\nThe underground passages (which were in the cities) that Anti-Skull had used for their experiments! His seniors didn’t know about these passageways, and the 12 generals didn’t know about them either. Because it was so difficult to enter them, it was much better to choose one of them, rather than randomly picking a dungeon.\n\"Since they’re so well hidden in a purified city, the undead will instinctively avoid them, and heroes wouldn’t enter a city without any prey. If Lee Man Bok had just a little bit of sense, then...\"\n\"Then you could’ve just kept him alive and told him about this later.\"\n\"I shouldn’t have to teach a level 7 this. Moreover, there’s a saying in my country that says ’humans never change’, Jin. It means that no matter how much I try teaching a dumbass like him, he’ll still be a dumbass.\"\n\"’Humans never change’...\"\nOne of the reasons Lee Shin Woo had continuously attacked and seized cities was to find an appropriate location to hide his troops. Of course, it was difficult to find an underground passage that was deep and wide enough to fit the Giants, but...\n\"Shin Woo, shall we begin?\"\n\"Alright.\"\nLike they’d done with the Kerr Century Winery in the past, Lee Shin Woo and Kratia expanded the secret facility, creating a space that would allow the Giants to hide without feeling cramped! Moreover, they created another secret passageway, giving them an alternate way to get out. Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on novᴇlfire.net\n\"Ah, that part’s mana structure is a bit off.\"\n\"Leave it to me.\"\nIt was as difficult as reconstructing the dungeon, but because Lee Shin Woo and Kratia were plenty experienced in it by now, they were quite efficient.\nWhat was most amazing was the fact they maintained the dungeon’s ’uniqueness’ while going about their work. Jin watched as the facility widened and became deeper in the blink of an eye and was shocked as always. However, it seemed like Kratia wasn’t pleased with the final result.\n\"We could’ve made it so much better if we could use spatial magic.\"\n\"Like Feotane von Seldin.\"\n\"...Hoo. Someday, I’ll learn it and beat him.\"\nLee Shin Woo thought it’d be faster if he just killed him and absorbed his bone, but decided not to say anything.\nThey had finished expanding the facility, and when hundreds of Giants, as well as the rest of his Paul Corps had safely entered, Lee Shin Woo suddenly received a private chat request. It was from Ye Jin Jin. He tilted his head, and as soon as he accepted her request...\n[Ye Jin Jin: You were alive. That’s such a relief...! I’m so glad!]\nHe wouldn’t hear the end of it if he said ’Hey wait, you know I’m dead already’. Lee Shin Woo told her he was safe and asked her what was going on. Then, she replied like this.\n[Ye Jin Jin: The level 3 danger zone is in chaos right now. Senior Ethan hasn’t even led one of the 12 generals in yet, but one of them is moving already!]\n\"What!?\"\nLee Shin Woo’s goblin fire burned finely. He couldn’t just let this go!\n\"If you know one of the 12 generals is coming, then you don’t even need to bait one of them. You can just take that one out.\"\n[Ye Jin Jin: No, you can’t. You can’t! Even Senior Ethan said that we shouldn’t mess with them...!]\n\"Even Senior... Ethan?\"\n[Ye Jin Jin: He said he’s (the general) a lot different from the rest. Even the other seniors, who saw their movements by chance, are shaking in their boots right now. He’s so fearsome that they’re hesitating over whether they should go on this expedition or not.]\n\"That bad?\"\nIf that’s the case, then was it the Vulture General that Lee Shin Woo had been waiting for? If he saw his air force, then it would make sense that they were quaking in their boots. Even if most of heroes had a way to attack flying monsters, they weren’t specialized in aerial warfare.\n’But the fact that Ethan wants us to avoid it is bothering me.’\nWhy did he want them to avoid it? Was it because he was communicating with the general? If not, was it because he had no connection with that specific general?\nLee Shin Woo thought the latter was more likely. Ethan Cruz was incredibly meticulous, and if he said that they should avoid him, then it was likely that that particular general was one that he couldn’t control with his abilities.\n[Ye Jin Jin: Yes, he’s really scary and he’s also strange. Apparently, that general broke a city in the level 3 danger zone!]\n\"...Huh?\"\n[Ye Jin Jin: It’s strange, isn’t it!? You don’t understand why one of the 12 generals under the Emperor would destroy one of their own cities, right? Plus, according to our seniors, he destroyed three cities.]\n\"...\"\nHearing that, Lee Shin Woo’s goblin fire shook. Since she couldn’t see his goblin fire and could only hear his voice, Ye Jin Jin continued to go on and on.\n[Ye Jin Jin: Moreover, he managed to conquer three cities in just a few days... I don’t know if there’s something strange going on in the Empire, but what I’m sure about is that he’s a strange undead and that he’s really dangerous. Plus, he apparently leads huge undead as well.]\n\"Hey, that’s...\"\n[Ye Jin Jin: Even if all the heroes worked together, we probably wouldn’t be able to beat him... Our seniors have already nicknamed him. He’s full of contradictions, so they called him the Heaven Defying General.]\n\"...He sure sounds amazing.\"\n’I thought the world had blessed me with the name, but it’s already being used by my fellow heroes. Is this the power of karma?’ Lee Shin Woo thought vacantly.\n[Ye Jin Jin: He is amazing. So, you have to be careful too, Mr. Shin Woo. If you see him, don’t fight him and just run away!]\n\"...Yeah, I won’t fight him.\"\nThe contradictory existence, the Heaven Defying General Lee Shin Woo weakly replied to her appeal.\nAlthough he liked to injure himself to train, he really didn’t want to kill himself.",

    "content": "<Chapter 34. Heaven Defying General - 7>\nA few days before their scheduled hunt of one of the 12 generals, the heroes were discussing an unexpected topic inside the chatting channel.\n[Lloyd H.K.: The Heaven Defying General. It fits him. After all, he’s going around destroying cities. What exactly is his goal...]\n[Ye Jin Jin: We talked about this before. That there were undead who acted against the Emperor...]\n[Prince Altania: That doesn’t prove anything.]\n[Ye Jin Jin: But still... if there was an undead like that, wouldn’t they cooperate with us? If our goals are the same, we can form an alliance with them.]\nBefore he entered the chatting channel, Lee Shin Woo told Ye Jin Jin that he was that Heaven Defying General. He’d told her without hesitating, as she already knew he was undead.After that, Ye Jin Jin tried her best to keep the other heroes from looking at him, or the Heaven Defying General too negatively. However, that wasn’t the easiest job in the world.\n[Seira Von Retadane: It’s meaningless. All undead are the same. They’re the enemy of all humans.]\n[Ethan Cruz: It’s a tough problem. Since all the undead in the Empire are obsessed with the living. Even if it looks like they’re intelligent, they revert to their undead nature when it matters most. Cooperating, huh. How can you trust him enough to cooperate with him?]\nHow shameless! He himself was a Necromancer who controlled undead heroes. Lee Shin Woo decided that now was a good time to both ease the tension against the undead and take a subtle stab at Ethan Cruz.\n[Lee Shin Woo: I think Ye Jin Jin may be onto something. Who’s to say all undead are against us? What if there were a hero conscripted by God herself that could control the undead. Like a Necromancer?!]\n[Seira Von Retadane: This is the only thing that Ethan and I agree on. The undead are impurities upon this world; they defy God herself! God would never create a Necromancer, as her penultimate goal is to eradicate the undead from this world. Regardless of whether they’re with a Necromancer, the other 12 generals or the Heaven Defying General, if they appear before you, you must kill them.]\n[Ethan Cruz: ...]\n[Lee Shin Woo: ...]\nLee Shin Woo and Ethan began sweating at Seira’s statement. Her hatred for the undead was beyond irrational. She was upstanding and righteous in an overbearing way.\n[Ye Jin Jin: But still... the Heaven Defying General has done nothing to warrant hostilities from the heroes.]\n[Erian Ruparte: I understand how you feel, Jin Jin. However, even I think that it would be impossible to cooperate with the undead. There’s something you need to consider before relying on them. Can you be sure that they are not affected by the curse? Can they not be controlled by the Emperor like every other undead in the Empire?]\n[Silene Viesa: It doesn’t make sense to form an alliance with the undead. You should know since you’ve been here longer, that the undead are unapproachable. Even if we could form an alliance, God gave the quest to purify them all for a reason.]\nAlthough Silene Viesa was the most recent hero, they had adapted to the Empire extremely quickly, as a result of actively fighting against the undead. Silene Viesa had done more in the Empire than Ye Jin Jin, causing them to look down on Ye Jin Jin.\n[Lloyd H.K.: Silene, that’s enough. Of course, I agree with you, but...]\n[Prince Altania: Mm... Right?]\n[Lloyd H.K.: What’s with you?]\n[Prince Altania: It’s nothing. That’s obvious. Mmm... I’ve never met an undead like that before, but I’m sure that that Heaven Defying General bastard has something else up his sleeve.]\n[Seira Von Retadane: I think he’s out of our league right now, so we should avoid him for the moment. ...Ethan Cruz, are you still going to proceed with your plan, despite everything that has happened?]\n[Ethan Cruz: I think we should proceed because of what has happened. It’ll become more difficult to hunt the 12 generals if the Empire’s movements change, so shouldn’t we go for it before then? With that in mind... everyone listen up. I’ve finalized the time, place, and the target. I know the way his troops are moving, so I plan on attacking first. I’ll send the participants the location right away.]\n[Prince Altania: Ooooh!]\n[Silene Viesa: Keuk, I want to go too...]\nWas it finally beginning? Despite an unknown force, the Heaven Defying General showing up in the Empire, it seemed like Ethan planned on going through with his plan. Soon, Lee Shin Woo was contacted by Ethan Cruz.\n[Ethan Cruz: I believe in you, Super Rookie!]\n[Lee Shin Woo: I believe in you too, Senior.]\n[Ethan Cruz: Haha, flattery won’t work.]\nThe battleground was a northeast area in the level 3 danger zone and was quite close to the level 4 danger zone, but because of the perilous mountain range behind it, there was a small possibility of enemies showing up.\nIt would be in three days at dusk when the Empire’s artificial sun became dim.\nTheir target was the level 7 Beast General. Since Lee Shin Woo had never heard of him before, he assumed that Ethan Cruz had indeed picked the weakest amongst the 12 generals.\n’I assume he has his undead mixed in with the enemy troops, but the issue is what else he has up his sleeve.’\nAs Lee Shin Woo contemplated all possible moves Ethan Cruz could deploy... A light bulb turned on in his head!\n’What if he has another general coming from over the mountain? ... If that’s the case then they need a mode of communication to set up the ambush or time the reinforcements.’\nLee Shin Woo was sure of it. As the city which sent a report while he was conquering it, as well as where the Vulture General had sent his scouts, was the city that Ethan Cruz was talking about!\nLee Shin Woo then remembered that he still had the communication device found on the city lord. If he used his Mana and just tweaked some of the device’s functions... Yes! He could detect other similar devices within a certain area and interfere or even hijack their signal!\n[Master, I can integrate the device’s functions into my system.]\n\"That’s a good idea Rem.\"\nNow that he had the surveillance golem, Rem, Lee Shin Woo could use Assimilation and interfere with the communication remotely!\n\"It’s time we start to prepare for the battle in 3 days.\"\n[We are at your command.]\nLee Shin Woo sat Kratia behind him atop Jin’s back. Once he’d looked over his forces one last time, he looked at the sky, even though he knew that there weren’t any scouts in the sky through Rem.\n\"The Vulture General, huh... I guess we’ll end up facing him after all.\"\n\"You have a good idea, Kratia?\"\n\"If you attach wings to Jin, then we can take care of him ourselves.\"\n\"Hey, don’t put anything on me!\"\nLee Shin Woo ignored the quarreling Jin and Kratia and worked on something he’d been postponing. Training the level 6 staff, the Bone Winged Serpent’s skill: Serpent’s Whirlwind.\n\"Hoo... I should get a feel for this before I meet Retadane.\"\n\"You’re going to try it out?\" Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on novęlfire.net\n\"Yeah.\"\nSeira Von Retadane. Apparently, she wielded light magic. Light magic was like poison to the undead, and it was a power that every hero wanted.\nLee Shin Woo was surprised when he obtained darkness magic, but he just accepted it and moved on. He had thought that the darkness element suited him, as he was an undead as well.\nHowever, when he thought he might be able to use light magic by using his staff in tandem with his darkness magic, he suddenly felt a fear that he’d never experienced before.\n\"Why have you been postponing it for so long then?\"\n\"...To be honest, I attempted it before the staff evolved, but at the time, the staff’s output was too low, so I failed.\"\nThe darkness element was clearly different from the other elements. When he’d awakened the darkness element, it was definitely described as a ’great element’. If that’s the case, then the light element, which was its polar opposite, should be a ’great element’ as well. The power of light was much too great for the staff at the time.\nHowever, once the staff had evolved into the Bone Winged Serpent, he came to the conclusion that it would be able to convert the darkness element as well. If that was true, then all that was left was Lee Shin Woo’s decision.\n\"Even if it damages me, I want to see it with my very own eyes before someone else uses it against me.\"\n\"...Shin Woo, don’t use that on me.\"\n\"Wow, how considerate of you... Anyway, let’s go.\"\nLee Shin Woo grabbed onto one of the Breath of the Lightning Gods, which floated in the air behind him as if protecting him, and converted it into a Bone Winged Serpent. And he carefully infused a small amount of darkness magic inside.\n[Activating the Serpent’s Whirlwind.]\nThe bone wings fluttered, and the infused power began swirling. The old staff would’ve stopped and blown a fuse in the middle, but it didn’t this time. Although it didn’t amplify it by very much, the darkness magic was definitely being converted into light!\nLee Shin Woo carefully stretched out his hand and grabbed onto the light. But at that moment, it felt like a power he hadn’t even been aware of began to well up within him.\n[Holy Resistance is reacting to the light magic. You have acquired Light Resistance: MAX. Magic has increased by 100.]\n[Through the power of extreme exposure to Light, The Light Element has been comprehended and Magic has increased by 1500.]\n\"...!?\"\nLee Shin Woo could feel it. The Holy and Light elements were similar. Which is why when he got Light Resistance his stat gain was so low; he already had Holy Resistance: MAX. Yet he also started to comprehend what light truly was.\nLee Shin Woo was in a fantastical state of mind. Everything light suddenly made sense. It was the element that severed, much like how darkness was the element that bonded people. He felt that he could understand most of the good and bad of this world. The connections and bonds between everything and anything, and also sever it. Everything...\n\"Jin, come here for a sec.\"\n\"Shin Woo, why are you looking at me like that?! Like I’m some sort of lab rat?\"\n\"Don’t worry about it, I just want to test my new light element. I can see and sever many connections now... including your connection to your current body. I also have a better understanding of darkness now too... I think I can use Assimilation and disguise in tandem now!\"\n\"\"...\"\"\nBoth Kratia and Jin were speechless. Lee Shin Woo could now interfere with God! Moreover, Jin could finally take on a human appearance and not have to be quiet around other heroes.\nBefore Jin could say anything in return, Lee Shin Woo began to use Assimilation and disguise to revert Jin back to his former world’s form. And soon after a flash of light...\n\"...\"\n\"Wow, Jin I didn’t know you were also a god?!\"\nKratia was speechless. She was sure Jin was a female, but what stood before her was a cute young man. He was dainty for a male, almost like a bishounen. He had a beautiful complexion, slightly chubby cheeks, like his baby fat was still showing, short black hair that shone as if it were polished onyx, and wore a toga and sandals with cute little wings. He was the greek god from Earth, Hermes!\n\"H-hello...\"\n\"...\"\nJin blushed as he greeted Kratia.\nLee Shin Woo was amazed.\n’So that’s why I never heard of a sprinter named Jin Taylor... Even though I was sure he was from Earth, and even from a time before my own.’",

    "content": "<Chapter 35. The Call of Death - 1>\n\"Lee Shin Woo and Kratia Melloi. It’s a pleasure to meet you. You must’ve suffered so much to reach where you are without dying. Thank you for surviving.\"\n\"It’s nice to meet you too... Senior Retadane.\"\n\"Hi.\"\nRed eyes and red hair. Lee Shin Woo had only seen one person with those traits thus far: the beauty from the secret shop (if he told her, she would be happy and smile unpleasantly, so he had no plans of telling her), Pleine.\nAlthough God herself possessed red hair as well, her eyes glittered in the five cardinal colors, so he excluded her.\n\"Are you bothered by my hair?\"\n\"That’s...\"\nBut now there was one other with those specific traits: Seira Von Retadane. She was so unbelievably beautiful that she almost didn’t fit in with everyone else.\nThere was no hint of confusion within her clear red eyes, and her pale pink lips were closed shut, seemingly embodying her iron will. Contrary to her cold expression, her ardent, long red hair fluttered in the wind, as if it would catch aflame at any moment.\n\"My apologies, Senior. I was just wondering whether you gain red hair for becoming a priest.\"\n\"...I see. That’s obviously not true.\"\n\"Oh, you don’t?\"\n\"No, you don’t. My red eyes and hair are hereditary traits.\"\nShe was baby-faced, looking like a young girl, but also voluptuous. He was concerned that their size would become a hindrance on the battlefield but thought her bust and narrow waist were striking.\nThe white priest robe she wore couldn’t hide her voluptuous figure. If he were to take a picture of her, others would react with ’this is definitely photoshopped’. They would say ’she must be an alien, not a human being with a bust that large and a waist that thin’, but she was definitely the real deal.\nShe must be a mutant. Lee Shin Woo was very slightly in awe of her.\n’I can understand how Shino Rendu fell in love with her at first sight. Of course, it doesn’t matter to me, but there’s something else that bothers me...’\nLee Shin Woo’s sexual desire had evaporated, but he could still recognize beauty. However, Lee Shin Woo was currently only worried about keeping his guard up against her. He was sure the moment he met her. This girl was level 8. He had somewhat expected it, but she was indeed level 8!\n\"I feel like you could take down one or two of the 12 generals by yourself, Senior.\"\n\"I think so too. However, there’s no guarantee after that. Because of that, I don’t want to make any large moves yet. My goal isn’t the 12 generals. It’s eradicating all the undead in the Empire. Therefore, there’s so much I want to say to Ethan Cruz, but...\"\nLee Shin Woo carelessly blurted out, and Seira Von Retadane replied seriously. She sounded so serious, causing Lee Shin Woo to think. She didn’t know, but Lee Shin Woo had already killed two of the 12 generals.\nBut was that a mistake? ...Of course it wasn’t. Lee Shin Woo had merely picked what was most advantageous to him at the time. When this was all over, he would have to move more carefully than before. Though it might’ve been too little too late.\n\"Hoo, let’s begin when Yasunori Akira comes and joins us. Would you like some tea?\"\n\"Thank you, Senior.\"\n\"I wanted to tell you this before, but... I don’t really like being referred to as ’senior’. Please just call me Retadane.\" Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on novel{f}ire.net\n\"Ah, ok.\"\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo, as an undead, couldn’t drink tea, but he could at least fake it. He would let it go down his throat and then evaporate it with fire.\n\"Please wait a little bit.\"\nShe removed various tools to make tea from her inventory. Lee Shin Woo watched as she boiled water for her tea, and came to the realization that she was no ordinary hero. Who would go through all that trouble to steep tea leaves!?\nMoreover, one couldn’t procure tea leaves from the Empire, which meant that she acquired them from the secret shop... By comparing it to wine, it was clear how inordinately expensive such an item of personal preference was.\n\"Here, please enjoy.\"\n\"Thank you. With pleasure.\"\nLee Shin Woo was surprised when he grabbed onto the tea cup. He didn’t have a sense of taste, but for some unknown reason, he was able to smell the fragrance of the tea.\nA fragrance so pleasant that it was shocking. He would often have to meet with other people for work, so he had drunk a variety of different teas, but it was of such quality that he could easily say it was the best he’d ever had.\n\"It smells really nice.\"\n\"This tea didn’t exist in my world. It’s delicious.\"\n\"Hoo, you can appreciate good tea. It’s my favorite tea amongst all the ones available on the surface. I assume it’s made by using the Kunoa leaf (which is grown in places with powerful fire magic) and Korite leaf (which is grown in places with powerful wind magic)...\"\nHow can this be? To think she’d continue the conversation! Lee Shin Woo was shocked as she, who had remained passive and calm, suddenly began to talk about the tea leaves and the water in depth.\nAt the same time, he couldn’t help but see the resemblance with Pleine, who would change whenever he brought up wine...! Lee Shin Woo was curious and asked.\n\"...Are you close to the shopkeeper by any chance?\"\n\"No, that woman’s the worst. That’s quite rude of you to say.\"\n\"I-I’m sorry.\"\nShe cussed out Pleine! Now that he thought about it, Pleine had a lot of things to say about her as well. Moreover, she had the same red eyes and red hair...\nAt that moment, Lee Shin Woo formed a hypothesis. However, when he saw Retadane’s expression, which had turned frigid instantaneously, he knew that this wouldn’t be easy to bring up. But fortunately, that vibe didn’t continue for very long. Yasunori Akira had arrived.\n\"I’m late. Sorry about that. I was moving so cautiously that it just turned out that way.\"\n\"That’s fine. Would you like some tea?\"\n\"Yeah, of course. ...Mm, the fragrance reminds me of my homeland.\"\n\"Hello, Senior.\"\n\"Mm!? Ah, is that you, Lee Shin Woo? ...That’s surprising. You look a lot different than what I’d expected. I’m Yasunori Akira.\"\nHe possessed black eyes and black hair, giving off the feeling of an Asian man, but even so, he didn’t really evoke the feeling of being Japanese.\nThen again, when he’d met Ye Jin Jin last, he felt like she was a lot taller and had nigh-white skin, unlike other Chinese people. It was the same feeling. Perhaps they both came from a world similar but ultimately different from his own Earth.\n\"Thanks for the tea. ...So you already knew about this dungeon, huh.\"\n\"It’s a dungeon that I cleared by myself in the past. There are dungeons that disappear after they’re cleared and dungeons which remain, due to the large traces of residual magic. This is the latter.\"\nThat’s right. They were gathered inside of a dungeon within the level 3 danger zone right now. Dungeons are normally filled with danger, but ironically, empty dungeons were the safest place that heroes could reside.\n\"Now that the Heaven Defying General has gone on a rampage... I might have to find a dungeon and hide too.\"\n\"The Heaven Defying General... I wonder if he’s connected with Ethan Cruz as well.\"\n\"He probably isn’t. The Heaven Defying General isn’t doing Ethan Cruz any favors in baiting the 12 generals and gathering the other heroes.\"\n\"That’s true. I realized that Ethan Cruz’s movements were strange because of it, but... Shall we begin talking in earnest? Regarding what Ethan Cruz is plotting.\"\nRetadane said seriously, and Yasunori nodded his head stiffly. They wanted to protect their juniors and took their jobs as seniors seriously, so Lee Shin Woo couldn’t tell them that he ’actually had his own corps and that while they kept the 12 generals busy, we can take care of Ethan Cruz’.\n’I can’t tell them my true identity, let alone the fact that I lead the undead, or things will go wrong fast.’\nLee Shin Woo sighed and decided to go with the flow. They started off with the Beast General, Jilun Pelta, went on to Ethan Cruz’s plans that he may or may not have, as well as any other unknown variables. They told the ’human hero Lee Shin Woo’ all this information, believing that it was safe to tell him all this.\n\"At first glance, this looks like a good place to fight against the Beast General, but if there’s a foe that is unhindered by the mountain range, there’s a high chance that the heroes will be stabbed in the back.\"\n\"A foe that is unhindered by the environment... Lee Shin Woo, do you have any guesses?\"\n\"I don’t know if it’s one of the 12 generals or not, but I took down an undead mounting a flying monster just a little while ago.\"\n\"A flying monster, undead... Ha.\"\nRetadane gritted her teeth, as though it suddenly clicked.\n\"The Vulture General, Bureuche Von Golden Eagle...!\"\nHis title was ’Vulture’, so why was his family name ’Golden Eagle’!? Lee Shin Woo anguished over that irony, and Retadane gave them the answer.\n\"He’s bald. The Emperor thought it was funny and gave him that title, but he doesn’t like his title very much. Amongst the 12 generals, he’s probably the one who hates being called their title the most.\"\n\"I see...\"\nSo that’s how it was. He suddenly felt sympathetic and became fond of the Vulture General. But when he asked Retadane why she had such detailed information on him, she said...\n\"It probably worries you. ...Yasunori Akira, isn’t it the same for you as well?\"\n\"It does worry me, but I’d rather not force someone to talk when they clearly don’t want to.\"\n\"It’s alright. I feel like I’ll work closely with you in the future, so I’ll just tell you and move on. Since I’d rather not experience Ethan Cruz’s foolish taunt ever again...\"\nLee Shin Woo’s ears perked up. However, Kratia, who never went into the chatting channel, didn’t know what was going on and tilted her head. Then, she revealed a bombshell.\n\"Seagald Von Retadane is my older brother.\"\n\"...\"\n\"...?\"\nHe knew that Seira was a descendant of the Retadane family, but he hadn’t expected her to be Seagald’s younger sister. Lee Shin Woo remained silent at her unimaginable confession, and Yasunori was likewise silent, as he couldn’t comprehend what she was saying for a brief period of time. However, Kratia informally spoke.\n\"An old lady?\"\n\"Hey!\"\n\"It’s alright. If you take into account my age, that actually fits. ...I am one of the few citizens of the Empire that survived on Sun Day, [1] and I am also the first hero picked by God. Of course, at the time, I was only level 2...\"\n\"Level 2...\"\nLee Shin Woo couldn’t even begin to imagine what she went through to go from level 2 to level 8. Moreover, she had to survive in the Empire with a living body!\nHe didn’t know if Retadane knew how they were feeling or not, but she remained calm as always.\n\"But most importantly, I’m a hero. And my brother, Seagald Von Retadane, is undead now. I promise you that I won’t hesitate when facing him. Eliminating all the undead and purifying the Empire is not just God’s will, but my own as well.\"\nRetadane said firmly. It would be impossible to ’ask her about Anti-Skull’. She likely knew what Anti-Skull represented. Despite that, she would still say that Seagald was undead now and that he had to be eliminated.\n\"Now then, let’s go back to our main topic. There’s a high chance that the Vulture General, Bureuche Von Golden Eagle, will show up. There’ll be enough forces to sow chaos amongst the heroes. So I’ll protect the heroes while you (Yasunori)...\"\nTheir war council continued for another few hours. Because of them, Lee Shin Woo knew how he would have to mobilize his army; so he hadn’t lost out.\nTwo days later, the participants of the 12 general hunt had gathered in one place.\n[1] T/N: Day of the Sun or Sun Day. Not Sunday.",

    "content": "<Chapter 35. The Call of Death - 2>\n\"It’s good to see you, everyone. Some of you I know, but there are also some new faces here.\"\n\"It’s nice to finally meet you, Senior.\"\n\"Wow, you’re Lee Shin Woo? You look nice. I totally thought a wild animal would show up...\"\n\"Pot calling the kettle black there, Lloyd.\"\n\"So the lady over here is Kratia? The rumors were right, you are beautiful. I feel like God has been picking heroes based on their beauty lately.\"\n\"Hi, you’re ugly. Unlike Shin Woo. Even his bones are good looking.\"\n\"...\"\n\"And you look weaker than Shin Woo too.\"\n\"R-Really...\"\n\"Senior Orun, those two are really skilled. Don’t just sit there shaking and come over here.\"\nAside from Ye Jin Jin and Silene Viesa (both of whom couldn’t participate due to their low levels), Lee Shin Woo was able to meet all of the other heroes face-to-face, which was deeply moving (of course, Yasunori Akira wasn’t present, but he should be hiding somewhere nearby).\nIt was ironic, as it was difficult to meet with them when it was peaceful, but when it came time to fight the 12 generals, all the heroes gathered in one place and chatted.\n\"You have no idea how much I wanted to meet you.\"\n\"I as well, Senior. Please take care of me.\"\nThe handsome middle-aged man, Ethan Cruz looked right at Lee Shin Woo and initiated a conversation; in response, Lee Shin Woo flashed him a bright, clean, and confident smile and replied. He would have never even suspected that Lee Shin Woo was conspiring to kill him just a few hours ago!\n\"I trust you. You’ll definitely be a huge help.\"\n\"I’m almost sick of hearing how you spare no expense to help your juniors.\"\nEthan Cruz and Lee Shin Woo laughed and conversed, but Jin, who was listening in, couldn’t help but laugh. A big help? Spares no expense? They were both lying to each other, and Jin, who knew the truth, would probably say something like ’Can you really be talking to each other like that?’.\n\"Haha, you really do have a silver tongue.\"\n\"I said this before, but I’ll trust in you, Senior. Hahaha.\"\nBut Lee Shin Woo was clearly the better swindler. Lee Shin Woo smiled, as he had already seen through Ethan Cruz’s plan, but Ethan Cruz had no idea what he was planning.\nAt this point, Lee Shin Woo’s Acting skill wasn’t just perfect, it was peerless, as it fooled Ethan into thinking that he was just a junior that respected his senior. With the very modest nature that he’d shown everyone in the chatting channel! Who could know that there was another side to him hidden behind that face?\nLee Shin Woo’s energy made him the superior con man. Although he wasn’t showing his darkness magic at all, Ethan was different; he was covered in chaotic darkness.\n’As I thought, his darkness energy is ridiculously strong. He sure is good at faking it...’\nEthan Cruz hid his specialty well; he was a specialist in darkness magic debuffs, though he acted like he was a buffer. On the other hand, he didn’t hide his darkness magic.\nEthan told his juniors that he used some sort of darkness buff, but... because Lee Shin Woo was able to see it, as he could use a high rank darkness magic, and possessed a high affinity with mana. Eight threads that originated from Ethan Cruz trailed off to a place quite far away.\n’Rem.’\n[I will begin pursuit. Would you like for me to do something else once I have found them?]\n’You wouldn’t be able to if they’re grouped up, but it seems like there are two of them that are acting separately.’\nObviously, Ethan Cruz couldn’t show his undead heroes to the other heroes. And it was also obvious why Ethan Cruz was mobilizing a portion of those undead heroes. After all, he had to prepare for someone like Yasunori Akira.\nIf someone from the outside learned of what he was planning, then Ethan Cruz would have to drop his facade, so he was using his undead to scout out for anyone who might interfere with his plan.\n’In any case, the fact that he’s sending two out means... that I have to assume that Ethan Cruz is prepared as well.’\nAlthough Yasunori Akira was hidden, it seems like he hadn’t fooled Ethan Cruz. He should’ve hidden better. If he just let them do as they pleased, Yasunori Akira may be in trouble, but it largely depended on Yasunori Akira’s skill.\n’I can’t let that happen. After all, he’s a precious ally who could have a huge impact on the battlefield.’\nOf the Paul Corps under his command, Lee Shin Woo picked a few of the most powerful and fastest amongst them and gave them separate orders.\nTheir mission was obvious. They were to pursue the undead heroes and kill them! His subordinates’ kills counted as his kills, so he gave the order without hesitation.\n’Before the true hunt begins, I suppose I should cut off an ankle or two.’ Content orıginally comes from novel⁂fire.net\n[I will go and help them now. Beginning the program for optimized hunting and flight.]\n’Alright. I’m counting on you.’\nLee Shin Woo made Rem, who had borrowed his darkness magic and was beginning to search for them, completely responsible for this task. Then, he looked at Ethan Cruz and smiled ’naively’.\nAh, the other 6 undead heroes were probably joining up with the 12 generals’ troops. Since that was the simplest way to kill the other heroes.\n\"Hey, Lee Shin Woo. Let me see your skills.\"\n\"Oh my, Lloyd’s the one challenging him?\"\nLee Shin Woo, who had been looking at Ethan Cruz, heard someone call him and turned his head. There was a blonde haired, blue eyed man looking at him, who resembled a prince from a fairy tale; Lee Shin Woo wondered why this handsome man looking at him was emanating such a fighting spirit.\nSo much so that he wasn’t even worried about the fact that a charming elf, Erian Ruparte, was glued to his side.\n’Was he always this hot-blooded?’\nLee Shin Woo looked at Lloyd, felt dubious, and muttered inwardly. From what he remembered, Lloyd was always friendly to his juniors. In addition, he was also a popular guy who hogged Erian and Prince to himself... What exactly had changed? His eyes were looking at Lee Shin Woo as if he were a competitor, so Lee Shin Woo just naturally tilted his head.\n\"Senior, we’ll be fighting against one of the 12 generals soon...\"\n\"There’s still time before their forces show up, and besides, it should be fine; it’ll just be a light duel. I’d like to see those skills that everyone is always complimenting you for.\"\nLloyd sounded cool and collected, but he couldn’t conceal the passion within his voice. No matter how friendly he was, once a warrior, always a warrior, huh. Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and softly gripped the Breath of the Lightning God. It would completely ruin the mood if he were to reject this challenge.\n\"Hey, Lloyd... Do you have to be so juvenile and fight to decide who’s stronger? Are you a little kid?\"\n\"Sit tight, Prince. It’s just a duel.\"\nPrince tried to stop him, but he wouldn’t budge. Most of the other seniors watched on in curiosity. Since all of them wanted to see Lee Shin Woo’s skills first hand.\nWhat was the saying, ’a tall tree catches much wind’? If he thought from their perspective, then he and Kratia were both powerful and had popped up out of nowhere. It was obvious that they’d want to assess his skills. Moreover, it was difficult to test a magician’s ability out of the blue, so it seems like all of them had ’aggroed’ onto Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Damn, you’re being a dumbass.\"\n\"Why are you getting all worked up over a duel?\"\n\"Hoo... Whatever, go ahead you idiot.\"\nPrince had already seen Lee Shin Woo’s frightening abilities firsthand, so she knew that Lloyd would be humiliated if Lee Shin Woo went all out. She obviously didn’t want to see the man she loved lose so badly.\n\"Then, shall we move?\"\n\"You don’t need to do that. We can fight here.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nHowever, Lloyd hadn’t taken notice of Prince’s concern and just solely focused on Lee Shin Woo. His body shone and he became stronger than before, so it was clear that he had just buffed himself.\n\"Ah, you really are an idiot. I guess you won’t understand until he kicks your ass.\"\n\"...Prince, aren’t you a bit off today?\"\n\"Hah? You want a piece of me? Your ears are long, just like a donkey’s!\"\n\"What did you say!?\"\n\"If you’re not coming, then I will!\"\nPrince and Erian argued ’amicably’ and then, Lloyd, who acted like he’d give Lee Shin Woo the first move, spoke and came rushing over to him. Not only was he level 7, but he was also buffed as well, so he was incredibly fast!\n’Oh, I can see it easily even without Jin’s help.’\nUnfortunately for him, Lee Shin Woo’s stats were always being buffed by his Rebellion skill, while Rule of Bone also reinforced his body. His own buffs far outclassed Lloyd’s.\nMoreover, Lloyd had only just become level 7, while Lee Shin Woo was level 7 and had increased his stats exponentially, with a stat total of 9,200. Even if he doesn’t use all of his skills... he could take on Lloyd with one hand.\n\"Heup!\"\n\"Good!\"\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo didn’t unleash his full strength, and acted as though he could barely dodge Lloyd’s strikes. Hiding his skills in front of Ethan Cruz was the optimum decision, but... it was also in Lloyd’s best interest, or Lloyd’s confidence to be more specific, to take it easy.\n’If I want to do that, then I have to act perfectly.’\nAnd because he possessed such peerless acting skills, it wasn’t very difficult for him! It was his first time acting like he was unskilled, but it was nice in its own way. Lee Shin Woo clashed blades with Lloyd, and matched his swordsmanship just by acting.\n\"You’re blocking me well!\"\n\"Keuk, Senior. You’re too fast...!\"\nIt would look strange if he lost too easily, but at the same time, winning would count as a loss for him. Lee Shin Woo leisurely ran around in order to maintain that fine balance. He could only move like that because he had complete control over his body. And... in the midst of ’barely’ matching up to Lloyd, he felt like his abilities were improving for some odd reason.\n’The fact that I’m matching his level of swordsmanship might be increasing the precision of my own.’\nHe could see so many weak points, but he acted like he wasn’t aware of them and wouldn’t attack. Then, he would lead Lloyd into attacking where he wanted. He acted as though he had a weak spot, and then would barely block that attack. Doing all of that naturally was certainly very difficult.\nThat enabled him to improve both his swordsmanship... and his acting ability as well.\n[The Acting skill has become Lv19. There is no limit to your acting ability. You can act anywhere. You can act as though you are losing to an ant, but you can also bluff a dragon into leaving.]\n[The High rank Bursting Thunder skill has become Lv4. Strength and Magic have increased by 10.]\nLee Shin Woo’s movements became even smoother. He wasn’t turning the course of the duel around, but he made the fight look much closer than before.\n\"Ah, I guess we should stop here.\"\nHow many times had they clashed blades? In the end, Lloyd smiled regrettably, as he hadn’t been able to overpower Lee Shin Woo, and took a step back. His expression looked much more refreshed than it had just a little while ago; so much so that Lee Shin Woo felt better as well.\n\"Thank you for taking it easy on me, Senior.\"\n\"I wasn’t taking it easy on you. You really are strong. Then again, there’s no way you wouldn’t be skilled when your level is so high. I feel like you have at least intermediate level 7 swordsmanship...\"\n\"...I don’t know what to say.\"\n’I reached high rank level 4 because of you’... is something he couldn’t say.\n\"It guess that makes sense. I’m the same. To be honest, God gave me another secret skill... It’s a skill that always kills its target, so I can’t use it on my allies. You have a skill like that too, right?\"\n\"Of course, I don’t know if it’ll work on your or not, but I do indeed have another skill from God. Please use that skill on the 12 generals.\"\n\"Haha, alright. Take good care of me.\"\n\"That’s my line. Please take care of me.\"\nLee Shin Woo and Lloyd sported refreshing smiles and shook hands. If an outsider had seen the fight, then they would’ve assumed that the two were rivals that had acknowledged each other after a fierce battle... though he just looked like a swindler to Kratia and Prince.\nAnd that’s how Lee Shin Woo succeeded in completely fooling the other heroes about his abilities.",

    "content": "<Chapter 35. The Call of Death - 3>\n\"Why did you do that?\"\nOnce they had finished their duel, Prince grabbed Lee Shin Woo’s arm, not Lloyd’s, and dragged him away from the other heroes. She wanted to know why he had hidden his abilities.\nShe didn’t want to leave Lloyd behind, but it seemed like she didn’t like Lee Shin Woo hiding his abilities either. While thinking that she was a really troublesome person, Lee Shin Woo maintained his smile and replied.\n\"I just didn’t want to embarrass Senior Lloyd.\"\n\"Are you an idiot? We’re going to be fighting one of the 12 generals soon. Do you really think you’ll be able to hide your abilities then?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s nonchalant response caused her rosy cheeks to thin.\n\"You’re really...\"\n\"Ah, I’m not saying I’ll be playing around while you’re all in danger. There are so many ways that I can do my part without revealing my abilities.\"\nPrince was fed up with Lee Shin Woo, as he spoke while smiling unashamedly. However, she wasn’t able to criticize him anymore, as Lee Shin Woo’s expression turned serious and suddenly grabbed onto her shoulder.\n\"W-What is it?\"\n\"More importantly, you remember your promise with me, right?\"\n\"That’s... I know, I got it. I just need to stay next to you, right? Anyway...\"\nIt seemed like she’d say something strange if he just let her be, so Lee Shin Woo took the initiative.\n\"No, please stick with Kratia.\"\n\"...Huh?\"\n\"You have to stick with Kratia for the duration of this battle. Since Kratia will need your help for something. Please, you have to.\"\n\"Wait, that’s... Huh?\"\nPrince tilted her head, as she couldn’t understand his words or intent. But then, a single strand of mana coiled around her. It was Lee Shin Woo’s darkness mana. He was trying to find the root of Prince’s boundless trust and confidence in Ethan Cruz.\n\"Huh? What are you doing?\"\n\"It’s nothing.\"\nEthan Cruz had used a high rank spell on her. While the other heroes might not have noticed, it couldn’t escape Lee Shin Woo’s notice when he was actively trying to find it.\nIt would’ve been easier if Lee Shin Woo had found the spell when he had initially formed a contract with her, reminding him that he still had a long way to go.\n’Ah, is this it?’\nLee Shin Woo discovered the darkness magic and gently erased it on the spot. Of course, he did it covertly enough that the caster, Ethan Cruz, wouldn’t notice. He would probably notice eventually, but by then it would be too late.\n\"Hey wait, did you just do something?\"\n\"I just dispelled a small debuff that was applied to you.\"\n\"A debuff? Mm, now that you mention it, my body feels refreshed for some reason.\"\nIt’s likely her mind, not her body that’s refreshed. She wouldn’t feel the effects, as the spell had been applied to her so covertly. Which meant that she would still find it strange if he started talking to her about Ethan Cruz.\n\"In any case, you just need to remember one thing: please stick with Kratia.\"\n\"You want me to stay with her instead of with you? I-I’m straight! No matter how cool or mature I look as a man...\"\n\"Please don’t worry. Since I’m straight too.\"\nLee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and returned to the group with Prince. No one was suspicious of them, as they were aware that they had worked together before.\n\"If I could, I would keep talking with you guys forever, but... Unfortunately, I won’t be able to do that. The Beast General will be here soon. Everyone, get ready for battle.\"\nEthan Cruz gathered all the heroes in one place. Aside from Seira Von Retadane and Kratia, everyone was focused on him. Lee Shin Woo was the only person to see the quietly exchanged glances, their plot, and their resolve.\n’I guess it’s true. Mentes Orun...’\nMentes Orun was the more obvious of the two; he looked at the perpetrator, Ethan Cruz, with irritation, resignation, and fury, and also looked at the other heroes as well.\nIt may look like he was anxious before the battle, but to Lee Shin Woo, who knew his true intent, it looked ridiculous. Mentes Orun was one of the variables that could affect the coming battle...\n’Yeah.’\nLee Shin Woo decided quickly that he would have to take this guy down first. For that reason, he had arrived here before anyone else and had made preparations. A secret weapon that had even escaped Seira Von Retadane and Yasunori Akira’s notice!\n[Master, Chi Paul and Shino Rendu have caught up with Target 1.]\n’Oh, good. What about Yasunori Akira?’\n[He is still hiding. Target 2 is getting close, but Bisher Moon will stop him soon.]\nLee Shin Woo received his long-awaited report from Rem, raised his head, and secretly looked at Ethan Cruz’s complexion. The once relaxed and smiling middle-aged man had instantaneously stiffened. Yeah, he was shocked.\n\"What’s wrong, Senior?\"\n\"Oh, it’s nothing... Mm, don’t worry about it.\"\nEthan Cruz hadn’t been able to properly control his facial expression. Lee Shin Woo knew he would act like this, as two level 7 elites had popped up out of nowhere and attacked his subordinate. There was no way he wouldn’t be surprised. Also, since one of them was Shino Rendu, it made him feel like the world was against him.\n\"Senior, are you alright?\"\n\"You’re the most important person here, so please tell us if something is wrong!\"\n\"Haha, you rascals. I told you, there’s nothing wrong.\"\nEthan Cruz’s comrade, as well as the other heroes soon realized something was up. His juniors were concerned about him, and Ethan Cruz flashed them an uncertain smile. It would have been better if they had left him alone so he could think, but he couldn’t come up with a suitable response with all of them fussing over him. Oh, how embarrassing it must be!\n\"Senior, are you really ok?\"\n\"Ah, yeah. Of course I am. Even if something did happen, shouldn’t we be focusing on the upcoming battle?\"\nHe was absolutely right. Lee Shin Woo acted as though he were moved by Ethan Cruz’s statement and nodded his head. While he was doing so, Ethan Cruz’s expression worsened even more. Ah, the other undead hero must’ve been taken out by Bisher Moon.\nBisher Moon was powerful. He could use the darkness element, which made him and his element the undead heroes’ worst enemy. Moreover, Lee Shin Woo’s contract strengthened him significantly, so Bisher Moon could take on as many level 7 undead heroes as you could throw at him!\n\"Why is that bastard showing up now...\"\n\"What did you say, Senior?\"\n\"Hahahaha! Nothing!\"\nHe must be pissed! Ethan Cruz must want to punch Lee Shin Woo, as he was so nosily asking questions! But he couldn’t, as it would shatter his image as a friendly senior! Ethan Cruz smiled arduously; it was like Ethan Cruz’s mind was laid bare before Lee Shin Woo.\n’Are you having that much fun?’\n’Ah, this is the best.’\nLee Shin Woo acted as though he were genuinely concerned for Ethan Cruz, and only Jin knew Lee Shin Woo’s true intentions. He’d once said that Lee Shin Woo was nice in the past, but that was a mistake. This guy was definitely something else; he was more wicked than the devil himself!

You have partially cleared the quest objectives, and have acquired 1 secret shop permit. The maximum level of the Invisible Heart skill has increased by 1.]\nThen he noticed that Chi Paul and Shino Rendu had killed the undead hero. One of Ethan Cruz’s 8 undead heroes had gone down by one!\n\"Keuk...\"\nEthan Cruz acted like there was nothing going on and wore a serious expression, as if preparing for the upcoming battle with the Beast General, but it was obvious that he was desperately thinking something like ’what the hell is going on?’ or ’what should I do to ensure that the other one doesn’t die?’.\nHowever, he was already too late. He should’ve been prepared for this when he had left his subordinates to operate independently. Once Lee Shin Woo had tracked their movements, they were as good as dead!\n[You have acquired 2 secret shop permits and 31,632,240 Perium.]\n[You have given peace to a comrade who walked a path he could not return from. You have partially cleared the quest objectives, and have acquired 1 secret shop permit. The maximum level of the Invisible Heart skill has increased by 1.]\nEthan Cruz was here, while his remaining six subordinates were with the Beast General’s forces, so he couldn’t do anything about it. Ultimately, his second undead hero was killed.\nRight before it died, Lee Shin Woo saw Ethan Cruz flinch and attempt to use his darkness magic. It seemed like it was a technique that buffed his subordinates, or perhaps it was a healing ability of some sort.\nBut because all eyes were on him, he stopped himself, as his plans would be ruined if he got caught right now. As a result, the undead hero was futilely killed by Bisher Moon.\n’To think I’d be able to take down two level 7 undead heroes so easily.’\nHe had gained 6 secret shop permits, as well as 100 million Perium. He’d also be able to collect the bones soon, so he saw Ethan Cruz as Santa Claus coming with a present bag. Moreover, there were six more presents he had yet to open!\n\"Senior, you look uncomfortable. Shall we call everything off?\"\n\"No... It’s fine. If we don’t do it now, we’ll lose our opportunity. My condition’s just not great today. Don’t worry about it too much.\"\n\"But still...\"\nHe had just wanted to eliminate anything that could put his plans at risk, but he had instantaneously lost 25% of his forces. Thus, Ethan Cruz’s expression had noticeably crumpled up.\nEven he, who had spent all his time hiding his true intent from everyone, would find it troublesome to remain calm in light of this situation. Moreover, he had no way of knowing who his opponent was, so he felt screwed.\n’That’s why I can’t back down.’\nAvoid this opportunity to procure several undead heroes just because of some unknown variables? No way. Although he had lost two of his undead heroes, there was no going back for Ethan Cruz. He had no choice but to account for the unknown variable and succeed in his mission.\n\"Everyone get ready! Concentrate. Our opponent’s one of the 12 generals. You never know when you might die!\"\n\"Yes sir!\"\nThough they were worried about Ethan Cruz, the heroes immediately stiffened and nodded their heads.\nLee Shin Woo saw one of Mentes Orun’s hands shake. He saw Lloyd, Prince, and Erian looking at each other, restless. Seira Von Retadane was gently looking at him. And he felt like he could hear Yasunori Akira grabbing his sword from afar.\n\"Before we go, let me buff all of you...\"\n\"I don’t need it.\"\nKratia flatly refused, grabbed onto Prince with one hand, and gently jumped into the air. Her orb appeared and gleamed in the air, creating a disc of ice, and allowing her to land upon it.\n\"Since the magic we’ve prepared doesn’t mix with darkness. We’ll be going first.\"\n\"H-Hey!?\"\nKratia wasn’t someone Ethan Cruz could control. He gaped, as right before he cast his ’buff’ on Prince, Kratia had grabbed her and gotten away, far enough that they couldn’t be seen.\n\"But I’d like to get the buffffffffffff!\"\nPrince’s voice echoed, so they had definitely entered the mountain range. Ethan Cruz looked agitated, and Lee Shin Woo gave an excuse for Kratia in her stead.\n\"She’s a magician who didn’t even want to receive God’s power. But she’ll do her part, so please don’t worry about her too much.\"\n\"Is that so...?\"\nThere was nothing he could do, so Ethan Cruz just nodded his head. He kept his eyes fixed in the direction they left - the mountain range, and Lee Shin Woo didn’t miss the wicked intent behind it.\n\"To think they’d refuse Senior Ethan’s buff. It was a bit too much of her to have not let Prince get the buff either.\"\n\"Magicians may have different rules, no? Senior, I’m in your care.\"\n\"Yeah. There are fewer people, so the buff will be even stronger than before.\"\nLee Shin Woo also received Ethan Cruz’s buff. He had Darkness Resistance and had to restrain it from activating as much as possible. If his resistance took effect, then Ethan Cruz’s ’buff’ would disappear at any time. Ethan Cruz had no idea, so the moment the buff took effect, he smiled secretly.\n\"How is it? Do you feel stronger?\"\n\"So it’s true.\"\nOnce the duration time passed, the body would become heavy, and the target would be defenseless against Ethan Cruz’s curse; it was incredibly wicked energy. Once the buff took effect, one would be playing in the palm of Ethan Cruz’s hand.\n’But that’s only if you don’t have Darkness Resistance: MAX and High Rank Darkness.’\nLee Shin Woo was actually happy about this newfound connection with himself and Ethan Cruz. Now all he needed to do was flip who was superior in this connection... This difficult task would be great for advancing his darkness element.\n\"I’m fine. Light and darkness do not mix.\"\n\"Is that so...\"\nRetadane also refused his buff. As she did so, she looked at Lee Shin Woo worryingly, but he just nodded his head as if to say that he was alright. Ethan Cruz had no idea that the two were in on this together, and decided that he would have to procure Retadane from this no matter what.\n10 minutes later, he saw the tip of the force led by the Beast General, Jilun Pelta.",

    "content": "<Chapter 35. The Call of Death - 4>\n[You are facing an irrational number of opponents with only a small handful of allies. Through the Rebellion skill, all stats have increased by 16%. All effects are shared with your partner.]\n\"Wow, the hell is all that?\"\n\"He’s called the Beast General, right? As expected...\"\nThe Beast General was a Werewolf, a level 7 elite, and led a force of beasts. Thus, his undead troops possessed a characteristic that differentiated them from any of the 12 generals’ troops he’d seen thus far, which was...\n\"They’re huge...!\"\n\"Bears, tigers, wolves... Why are animals part of the Empire? It looks like a monster army rather than an Imperial Army.\"\n\"They have the bodies of beasts but the minds of humans. Don’t be reckless or you’ll be dead before you know it.\"\nTo think the Beast General’s force was only about 10,000 strong. You couldn’t convince anyone that that force was large. However, they all radiated danger. It was surprising, as they weren’t normal soldiers and all of them were elites, each and every one of them trained to the very limit.\n\"They’re all at least level 4 . That’s ridiculous.\"\n\"We won’t lose. We can do this.\"\n\"Leave the rear to me. I’ll protect Llo... everyone.\"\nThe heroes surveyed the undead with unease and then raised their weapons. Lee Shin Woo did the same. The sight of sparks crackling from his Breath of the Lightning God surprised all the heroes.\n\"Lightning element...!?\"\n\"That’s the first weapon I’ve seen emitting such intense lightning. Did you get it from God’s garden?\"\n\"I’ll be going first!\"\nLee Shin Woo yelled out and charged atop Jin. Ethan Cruz had already formulated a strategy and a battle formation, but if Lee Shin Woo did exactly as Ethan Cruz said, then wouldn’t he just be playing in the palm of his hand? After all, Lee Shin Woo would ’have to hide’ his abilities in this battle.\n\"O-Oh no! Lee Shin Woo! Wait, why is that horse so fast!?\"\n\"That idiot...! Let’s go too!\"\n\"Erian, back him up before he’s overwhelmed by the undead!\"\n\"Understood!\"\nThe other heroes acted in a hurry. Of them, Seira Von Retadane’s weapon was most striking; it was a flail, an iron mace covered in sharp spikes attached to a handle by a chain.\n\"Huaaaaaahp!\"\nThe sight of a slender woman swinging an iron mace connected by a chain even caused the other heroes to pause.\n\"R-Retadane, that’s your weapon...?\"\n\"I was sure she was a light element magician.\"\nThe beasts, with their good eyesight, were soon able to see the heroes. The sound of a horn resounded throughout the battlefield, and the giant undead beasts in the forefront rushed forward.\n[You hero scum, how dare you so fearlessly challenge the Beast General’s forces!]\n[We’ll turn you all into undead and have you join our army!]\n[Get ready... Keok!]\nLee Shin Woo quickly charged into the vanguard and crushed them with the Breath of the Lightning God. His dash to the enemy troops looked like exploding lightning itself! He sat atop his horse and provoked his enemies with a bold declaration.\n\"I’m the hero, Lee Shin Woo! I’ll burn you all to a crisp, so come try me if you dare!\"\n\"That guy, was he always so impetuous...!?\"\n\"Follow him! It’ll become dangerous if we face off against Jilun Pelta face to face!\"\nThe other heroes followed behind him and clashed with the beasts. Lloyd H.K. and Mentes Orun both wielded a sword in one hand and a shield in the other. They differed in that Lloyd was skilled with his sword, while Mentes used his shield better. A shield wasn’t good at penetrating an enemy’s defense, but it enabled them to take on a portion of the swarming enemies and fight safely while Lee Shin Woo did his thing.\n\"Heuryaaaap!\"\n[Keheok!]\n[Kahk!]\n[S-Stop them! We’re being pushed back!]\nMeanwhile, Seira Von Retadane swung her flail around, crushing a portion of the enemy troops with the attached iron mace.\nShe pulled back the attachment without difficulty and spun the mace once more. The beasts were shocked at the sight of her and attempted to set up their defenses, but it wasn’t very effective. She swung her flail again, and the mace killed dozens of beasts.\n\"I’m here too!\"\n\"If you’re going to support me, do it right!\"\nThe archer, Erian Ruparte, and the magician, Ethan Cruz supported the heroes from the rear. Although she was still level 6, she not only shot out a ton of arrows, but the force behind said arrows was extremely powerful. Meanwhile, Ethan Cruz shot out his incredibly powerful darkness magic, inflicting damage upon the Beast General’s forces.\n[Kuoooooooooooooh! Those who look down upon the Empire... Kneel!]\nBy the time the heroes had broken through the enemy lines, the Beast General, Jilun Pelta’s voice resounded through the battlefield.\nBefitting his name, the Beast General’s lion roar was wild and bloodthirsty. So much so that the heroes whose stats were lower than his flinched and stiffened.\n’Is that it?’\nNot only had Lee Shin Woo experienced screams before and had gotten used to them, but he was also the ’authority’ on the subject, so much so that he could write a one hundred page thesis on screams. Thus, Lee Shin Woo was able to shrug off the scream.\nBut he was unsure over whether he could defeat Jilun Pelta one on one. It was the same with Metafel, but this guy was definitely on the cusp of level 8. There was some worth in staking his life in the battle in order to advance his skills, but it wasn’t the right time for that.\n’Moreover, there’s something I need to do.’\nKilling the beasts and cutting down their numbers? No, his job wasn’t so trivial. What was Lee Shin Woo’s original objective? It was to protect the heroes and kill Ethan Cruz! So, what he needed to do right now was...\n’Kill all of Ethan Cruz’s troops that are hidden amongst the beasts.’\nHiding something so small amidst the huge beasts was the optimum strategy. However, Lee Shin Woo already knew that the undead heroes were hidden amidst the beasts and could spot them easily.\n’Moreover, this mana... Ethan Cruz’s mana is making it easier to find them.’\nEthan Cruz had probably intended for his mana to help his subordinates find the heroes more easily amidst the chaotic battlefield. However, Lee Shin Woo was using it for the reverse. He analyzed Ethan Cruz’s mana and followed it, enabling Rem to see where the undead heroes were, as they were connected to Ethan Cruz’s mana!\n’Rem?’\n[I have almost found all of them. You can come into contact with four of the six undead heroes, as the other two are by Jinlun Pelta. I will begin to guide you to them, Master.]\n’Good. What a nice GPS.’\nThe battle had only just begun, and none of the heroes had died thus far. Ethan Cruz planned to order his subordinates to strike when the heroes were fatigued, but...\n’But my time is now!’\n’I’m going!’\nThe moment Rem shared the route with him, Jin ran explosively! No matter who stood before him, charged at him, attempted to catch him front behind, or dropped from the sky, none could stop Jin as all the beasts were flung away.\nIn an instant, all eyes were on him, but because the battle was filled with so many giant monsters, his allies couldn’t really find him.\n\"Lee Shin Woo, that idiot. Where is he!? Umph!\"\n\"We don’t have any other choice right now. We have to calmly kill the monsters in our immediate vicinity. Don’t break rank. If you go too far out, they won’t be able to support us, and it’ll become dangerous for us too... Ah, Retadane!\"\n\"Huooooooooooooooh!\"\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t the only one who didn’t follow Ethan Cruz’s orders. Retadane was extremely excited, as she ran around swinging her flail.\nShe was skilled with a flail, and the iron mace, which contained a blinding light, cleaved through the air without any impediment. Whenever she struck an undead, the undead wouldn’t be able to even utter a word before disappearing without a trace.\n\"What... I guess we don’t have to worry about her.\"\n\"But she’s human, so she’ll get tired soon. Hoo, there’re a lot of people we have to look over. Moreover, how far did Miss Kratia take Prince?\"\n\"Don’t you think they’re preparing a huge attack of some sort?\"\nLloyd and Mentes Orun synchronized their movements and pushed the undead back; while doing so, Mentes secretly smacked his lips. Kratia and Prince hadn’t been buffed, so he would have to work extra hard to procure them, let alone Retadane.\n’I was most wary of Lee Shin Woo, but I should be able to subdue him. It’s good that that matter has been resolved, but what should I do about those two magicians?’\nAt this rate, Mentes Orun would have no choice but to leave those two to Ethan Cruz’s reinforcements. In any case, he would focus on taking down Lloyd for now. Thɪs chapter is updatᴇd by Nove1Fire.net\nIf they were able to procure Lee Shin Woo and Lloyd, then next, all they would need to do was wait until Retadane was fatigued. With the help of Ethan’s curse and the strength of one of the 12 generals, they should be able to take her down without much difficulty.\n’...I’m sorry, juniors. I wanted to see the Empire purified too. But life doesn’t always go the way you want it to.’\nBut at that moment...\n\"Wait! You’re (undead seniors) working alongside one of the 12 generals!?\"\nA booming voice resounded throughout the battlefield. It was none other than Lee Shin Woo.\n\"To think you’d hide amidst the general’s troops and aim for your juniors. How sad. But don’t worry. As your junior, I will correct your mistakes and put you to rest!\"\n\"...Seniors?\n\"...\"\nLloyd tilted his head at Lee Shin Woo’s proclamation, and Mentes stiffened, as their plans were going awry. On the other hand, Retadane stopped swinging her flail and broke into laughter. If they couldn’t understand the meaning behind his warning, then they had no right to be here.\n\"No matter who it was, or why they used you, I’ll get revenge in your stead! Huaaaahp!\"\n’Hey, you can act more naturally, can’t you!?’\nLee Shin Woo completely ignored Jin’s retort, found the first undead hero with Rem’s help, and attacked. The undead hero wielded a greatsword and responded to his attack, but there was no way he’d be pushed back by a similarly leveled undead hero. It was the same story even if he didn’t use his darkness magic.\n[Kyahak!]\n\"Ah, I see you can’t even speak...! Please have a taste of this lightning!\"\nNo matter how much stronger it had gotten under Ethan Cruz’s command, it couldn’t overcome Lee Shin Woo’s Rebellion and Rule of Bone skills. He killed the nearby attacking beasts with ease and then attacked. Right after Jin’s back feet touched the ground, they rushed forward!\n\"Heup!\"\n[Keuk!]\nLee Shin Woo added Shadow Horn to his thrust and broke through the undead hero’s greatsword with a single blow. Then, he flung the split greatsword into the air with his Breath of the Lightning God and split the heads of the attacking monsters!\n\"Don’t interrupt my final conversation with my senior!\"\n[Kuaaaaaaahk!]\nLee Shin Woo’s rage caused the undead to flinch. The moment they retreated, he pushed the undead hero back and burrowed his sword into its head within a few seconds. Only the remaining lightning in the sky bore witness to how his sword moved and how he had subdued his opponent.\n[You have acquired 2 secret shop permits and 28,115,470 Perium.]\n[You have given peace to a comrade who walked a path they could not return from. You have partially cleared the quest objectives, and have acquired 1 secret shop permit. The maximum level of the Invisible Heart skill has increased by 1.]\n\"Kuheuk... I won’t forget your sacrifice, Senior!\"\nGood. Now there were only five left. Lee Shin Woo picked up the level 7 bone and immediately used Bone Reinforcement. He then straightened himself out and his eyes shined with light. At that moment, Rem, who was flying in the sky, reported.\n[The Beast General is coming your way, Master!]",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 35 part5",
    "content": "<Chapter 35. The Call of Death - 5>\n\"Tch, I thought I’d be able to kill two of them. What terrible timing.\"\nLee Shin Woo smiled bitterly. He’d only killed one of the undead heroes that had been hidden amidst the beasts, yet the Beast General was already coming to intervene. He couldn’t even imagine how much influence Ethan Cruz had on the Beast General.\n\"Still, I can’t just sit here and do nothing... Alright, let’s retreat to Retadane.\"\n\"What about them?\"\n\"Not yet. Seems like they’re going to act once the heroes are fatigued.\"\nLee Shin Woo and Jin conversed and then began to move. The nearby remaining beasts gritted their teeth and charged, but once Jin began to sprint at full speed, there was nothing they could do to stop him.\nJin was so fast that he couldn’t be seen, as lightning struck his surroundings. Jin ran wildly, as the beasts caught aflame and were split apart.\n[Stoppppp!]\nAs they attempted to group up with Retadane, a boulder suddenly flew towards them. Lee Shin Woo threw his Breath of the Lightning God and broke it apart. Immediately after, a bear-shaped beast charged from in front of them.\n[Lv7 Werebear Suranta Bennett]\n[I can’t allow you to face the Beast General in person! Be a good boy and...]\n\"I don’t have time for that!\"\n[Keuk!?]\nLee Shin Woo charged without waiting for it to finish. The level 7 elite stretched its thick front legs and blocked his sword; it looked surprised.\n[To think you could stop my strike head on!]\n\"Heuuup...!\"\n[This is... Lightning...!?]\nLee Shin Woo concentrated and the Breath of the Lightning God’s lightning briefly intensified; it then spread across the bear’s body.\nSuranta wasn’t an elite in name only. It responded by using its mana to activate a skill, which fortified its body. However, that was the worst decision it could make. When skills clashed head on, the one that was a higher level would triumph!\n[H-How can this be? My skill is...!?]\nThe lightning enveloped its body and burned bright. The lightning ate through its fur and skin, as well as the skill. Suranta was shocked once it realized that Lee Shin Woo’s lightning had essentially canceled its skill. Then, Lee Shin Woo grinned and lunged with his Breath of the Lightning God.\n\"Nice. Then... Rest in peace!\"\n[Kahak!]\nLee Shin Woo was even able to convert all the mana on the battlefield into lightning through his intense ’breathing’, so doing this was just child’s play. Then, using Bursting Thunder, he thrust with his lightning clad sword, splitting the bear in half. Although it was indeed a level 7 elite, Lee Shin Woo had easily taken care of it in less than 30 seconds!\n[You have acquired 7,194,070 Perium.]\n[You have acquired the Lv7 Werebear Suranta Bennet’s front foot bone.]\nLee Shin Woo absorbed the bone immediately, but his Strength and Health only increased by 7 a piece. Once he saw how lousy its magic was, he figured it was weak, and it did seem like it was in the lower echelon of level 7s.\n\"Hoo. What’s with the attitude? You were the same level as me.\"\n’Are you going to go kill the Beast General now?’\n\"Let’s think about that after I level up.\"\nEven at this very moment, the Beast General was chasing after Lee Shin Woo. He could tell what state the battlefield was in based on how the Beast General was moving. Unfortunately, it wasn’t Lee Shin Woo’s style to fight him head on.\n\"Jin, run. That reliable old lady will protect us.\"\n\"Just make sure you don’t say that in front of her.\"\nJin ran quickly, even as he grumbled. Now that the Beast General was coming for them personally, the surrounding beasts attempted to stop them, but... they weren’t enough to stop Jin’s sprint.\nHe was like a meteor as he shook off anyone following them and ran straight for Retadane! Retadane soon noticed them whilst crushing nearby beasts and yelled in surprise.\n\"Lee Shin Woo!?\"\n\"Retadane, the Beast General is coming this way!\"\n\"You really do the most outrageous things...! Please stay behind me!\"\n[Kuoooooooooooh!]\nLee Shin Woo successfully joined up with Retadane, and immediately after, the Beast General screamed and pushed aside the nearby beasts. It was obviously none other than the Beast General himself, but... Lee Shin Woo was somewhat doubtful when he finally saw him.\n\"That’s the Beast General...?\"\n[So many annoying pests have gathered in one place! I’ll round you up and kill you all!]\nThe giant undead yelled and charged. Its entire body was composed of bones. He couldn’t believe it, it was a skeleton!\nThe higher level an undead, the more they resemble a human, so it made sense that Lee Shin Woo was suspicious, but... perhaps because it was a skeleton, it looked incredibly formidable! He thought it may be a stand-in or something to that effect, but when he checked the name, he confirmed that that wasn’t the case.\n[Lv7 Bone Werewolf - Beast General Jilun Pelta]\n\"It really is the Beast General...\"\n\"Indeed. No one can even come close to his savagery and cruelty; the Tyrant of the Battlefield...! We should take him out while we have the chance!\"\n[Kuheu, what do we have here? It’s the little lady of the Retadane house! What a joyous occasion. I’d always wanted to just eat you up!]\nOnce she saw the Beast General, Retadane’s red eyes eerily lit up and she charged. She swung her flail with unimaginable force and her weapon was filled with a blinding light, her inherent magic.\n[Kuhak! Keuk!?]\nThe flail cleaved through the air, and the giant bone wolf boldly took it head on. It opened its mouth wide and caught the flail. The moment they collided, the Beast General emitted a truly awful sound.\n[Kuhak... How have you become so strong!?]\n\"It’s funny when I look at you, still trapped in the past...! Keep yourself buried in the past and choke on it!\"\n\"Buried in the past... Pfft.\"\nLee Shin Woo watched on, and acquired some useless information, like the fact that ’when Retadane starts fighting, she begins to say some really infantile things’! But...\n’But her strength is real. Just by looking at her overwhelming physical strength and the magic within that flail will tell you how powerful she is. Moreover...’\nThose were all her own abilities... They (the undead) were nothing compared to the power of light. Even now, Lee Shin Woo felt Retadane converting a portion of the mana that spilled out from her body into light. It was such a radiant light that most undead would shrink from her approach!\nMost of the undead are maintained by darkness magic, but Retadane’s light magic ’denies’ the root of their existence and puts them in their proper place... In other words, she was trying to send them to their death. And the Beast General was no different.\n[Keuk, this light magic...!]\n\"As the last light priest in the land... I will exterminate the undead!\"\nThe Werewolf’s fingernails, which emitted a blue light, and Retadane’s flail clashed in the air a few times.\nIn terms of force, they were evenly matched, but whenever her weapon came into contact with him, the Beast General would become noticeably more tired. The Beast General, which wasn’t able to reach level 8, wasn’t able to deal with the light which covered the entire area!\n[Alright... I admit, you’re no longer a coy maiden anymore... Now that it’s come to this, I’ll fight you with my true form!]\n\"What? We’re on the second phase already?\" Thɪs chapter is updated by N()velFire.net\nIn the end, the Beast General admitted that he couldn’t let this go on, retreated, and gathered himself. For the time being, Lee Shin Woo watched their fight and attempted to analyze it. He couldn’t help but feel disappointed after watching the Beast General get hit a few times!\n\"Lee Shin Woo, how long do you intend to just sit there and watch? You’re the one who lured him over here.\"\n\"Of course I’ll help. Haha. I was just looking for the right opportunity since it’s so hard to keep track of your movements, Ms. Retadane.\"\nLee Shin Woo was done being a spectator. If he could, he would’ve waited until the Beast General showed the trick up his sleeve, but he couldn’t just do anything when Retadane was staring at him and asking for assistance.\nMoreover, Lee Shin Woo had been overlooking this, but with the continual expenditure of mana and stamina, Retadane would eventually get tired (as she wasn’t undead, but a human being)! Even now, her breathing had become haggard, albeit slightly. If he took into account the fact that this was the opportunity Ethan Cruz was looking for, then he couldn’t just let her be.\n\"Beast General, it’s my turn!\"\n[Kuha. You’re going to face me now?]\n\"You despoiled my senior’s bodies! I’ll take your life in exchange!\"\nLee Shin Woo said, which was just as embarrassing as anything Retadane would say, and rushed forward. He let Retadane catch her breath and charged! He concentrated his mana into a Breath of the Lightning God, and the Beast General faced him while smiling, as if finding him ridiculous.\n[In the end, you will all serve His Majesty... As proof, I’ll take you first!]\nAt that moment, splitting sounds came from the Beast General’s body as his bones broke apart. No, at least that’s what he thought was happening. Then, the broken areas were repaired with new bones. Bone was tangled with other bones in a complicated manner, and the Werewolf began to grow! He was transforming!\n[Kureureureureu... Kuhaaaaaah!]\nHe was already quite large, but he had grown in size by about two or three times. Sharply split bones sprouted from his back, resembling thorns.\nThey sprouted on his arms, down to the back of his hands, his stomach, and even all the way down to his legs! His entire body was covered in a bone armor, which made it difficult to even make out his original form. What Lee Shin Woo was sure of however was that the Beast General’s strength had increased significantly!\n[The strength of the 12 generals is absolute, and cannot be measured with mere levels! No matter how much you look at my level, or measure my magic, they’re ultimately just numbers! I’ll kindly teach you that lesson with your bodies!]\n\"Werewolf transformation... To think that you could develop that technique even further as an undead.\"\nRetadane focused her light magic into her flail and gritted her teeth. Lee Shin Woo listened and had some idea of what she was talking about. Just a little while ago, Bisher Moon had explained this to him.\nThe Beast Tribe possesses a separate human and animal form, but by using magic, they can topple this balance. They would strengthen the animal’s unique characteristics and temporarily increase their strength through the transformation technique.\nHowever, high rank members of the Beast Tribe could go one step further and surpass their limits, further reinforcing their bodies or even awakening an unknown specialty that could not normally exist in this world. At the time, Lee Shin Woo had just wrote it off as them transforming into a fantasy beast, but...\n[Thorn Wolf. That’s my special ability... Keuk, keuk. Can you still stay that I’m still ’buried in the past’ or what not? Fool. I gained a new body and became stronger than you could ever imagine!]\n\"Keuk...!\"\nHe declared and launched a left straight at Lee Shin Woo. Lee Shin Woo calmly blocked the blow with his Breath of the Lightning God but was pushed by the Werewolf’s ridiculous strength. To think that he would be pushed back, especially when Jin had increased the force with his charge!\n[I’ll skewer both you and your horse...!]\n\"Tch!\"\nHe’d thought that the Beast General’s transformation was over with, but the sprouting thorns continued to get larger and larger, and attacked Lee Shin Woo and Jin simultaneously!\nThey attempted to get away from him, but his Breath of the Lightning God was stuck between two of the general’s fingernails. What’s worse, nails sprouted up from between his fingernails as well, wrapping around his blade like vines. It was honestly quite disgusting.\nIf it were the average day, then he would’ve blown up the Breath of the Lightning God, or summon a new weapon to block the general’s attack, but Retadane was watching him right now, so he couldn’t show off his skills. If that’s the case, then...\n’I have to go with Bursting Thunder!’\nLee Shin Woo rapidly circulated his magic and focused it into his Breath of the Lightning God. He used his High Rank Mana Bone skill as a base to activate his Mana Acceleration skill, forming magic that would be effective against the general! He used High Rank Combat Sense as well in order to calculate the optimum course of action...!\n\"Heup!\"\n[Kuhak!?]\nFor a moment, the lightning reached its peak. The electric discharge burned the general’s fingernails and thorns instantly, and the freed Breath of the Lightning God moved at blinding speed; cutting through all the thorns that had been coming their way!\nHe cut through dozens of thorns at lightning speed, which resembled exploding lightning. It had both goosebump inducing precision and destructive power, so no matter how many thorns came at him and obstructed his vision, he could cut them all down, so long as he moved optimally.\n’Huh...?’\nBut at that moment, Lee Shin Woo realized something that was completely unrelated to Bursting Thunder.\n’How was I able to see those thorns and cut them down all at once?’\nOf course, it was likely due to his Combat Sense, as well as his connection with Jin, which amplified his reflexes, but that definitely wasn’t everything. It felt like he could naturally perceive the thorns with something else before his senses picked them up. Yeah, as if he could see the right course of action beforehand...\n[You’re quite powerful as well...! I’ll crush you!]\n\"I’ve had just about enough of you doing whatever you want!\"\nBut before Lee Shin Woo could come to an answer, Retadane, who had caught her breath, took the opportunity to swing her light covered flail at the Beast General.\n[Keuk!?]\n\"Don’t leave me behind!\"\n’Stop talking like a guy who has been dumped by his girlfriend!’\nThe Beast General was shocked and attempted to retreat, but it was Lee Shin Woo’s time to pay him back now! He was weak compared to Retadane or other level 8s, but his ’breathing’, which utilized Mana Acceleration, converted the area’s mana into lightning and stopped the Beast General for just an instant. That small span of time was enough for Retadane to get a direct hit on the Beast General.\n[Kuhak!]\n\"That ability just now... That was good. Let’s talk after we take him down!\"\n\"Ok!\"\nLike Lee Shin Woo had done, Retadane had also analyzed Lee Shin Woo’s fight with the Beast General while she was catching her breath, and waited for the perfect opportunity to strike. Now was the time to make use of that information for the two to push him back!\n[Kuhu... You’re trying to handle me, the Beast General, with just the two of you!?]\nThe Beast General used the force behind Retadane’s strike to retreat and activated an ability to restore his bones. Then he shouted bravely, but on the inside, he felt that he was in danger; if things went wrong, then he might die before their plan was even set into motion.\nAnd thus, the battle between the strongest hero duo and one of the 12 generals began.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 35 part6",
    "content": "<Chapter 35. The Call of Death - 6>\nTwo minutes had passed since they began to fight in earnest. The Beast General, who had transformed into a Thorn Werewolf, was taking hit after hit from the two heroes.\n\"Disappear!\"\n\"Huoooooh!\"\n[Thorn... Kuaaahk! To think you’d cut through my technique!]\nAlthough he could continuously attack and mend himself by controlling his bones, the two heroes’ attacks would break his bones as soon as he made the attempt! Retadane and Lee Shin Woo attacked as one, resembling that of a lightning storm.\n[You bastards are... Kuahk! I am...! Kuahk! I’ll kill you with my own hands... Kehehk!]\n\"Huooooh!\"\n\"How dare you turn my seniors into undead? I’ll never forgive you!\"\n’Yes, what lively acting.’\nRetadane gripped her flail, attacking like a berserker, and just let out a strange battle cry. Lee Shin Woo supported her, as her strikes left her with a lot of openings, and together, they pushed the Beast General back. He continued to act as though he were a hero with a strong sense of duty. Seeing that, Jin nonchalantly accepted it and pretty much knew what Lee Shin Woo was doing.\n\"Senior, I’ll go a bit faster!\"\n\"Alright... Let’s make sure we kill him here and now!\"\nWhat’s worse, their attacks intensified the more time went on, and the explanation for that was simple. Although they had never worked together before, they had seen each other’s techniques and movements throughout the battle and were able to more precisely work together because of it! The fact that they were able to move as one in that short period of time showed just how talented the two of them were.\n[Die!]\nThe Beast General realized that at this rate the situation would turn unfavorable for him, so he punched anxiously. His bone thorn covered bone fist instantly swelled in size and approached Retadane!\n\"Oh no you don’t!\"\nHowever, she didn’t back off an inch and took his attack head on. Her flail, infused with her light magic, clashed against his fist, causing an explosion!\nThe light was so intense that it would blind a high level hero, albeit for a short period of time, and simultaneously, the light spread. However, Lee Shin Woo could make decisions and move without sight, so he boldly ran into the diffused light and swung his sword.\n\"Heup!\"\n[Keuk!?]\nAlthough the Beast General’s multi-layered bone armor blocked the majority of his strike, a lightning bolt was discharged from the blade, striking the Beast General’s main body. An attack befitting the name of Breath of the Lightning God. However...\n’...Huh?’\nThe moment his attack worked, Lee Shin Woo felt cold and stood still. It was because he couldn’t feel any resistance whatsoever. The Beast General had used the force of his blow to push himself backwards and retreat.\nTo escape? No way. Even if he tried to run, he wouldn’t be able to get away from Retadane and Lee Shin Woo on such a crowded battlefield. He was probably just trying to buy a bit of time. Yeah... about 2 seconds worth.\n[That really hurt... Let me return the favor!]\nWith those two seconds he’d bought, Jilun Pelta used his most powerful skill. The bone thorns all over his body dropped to the floor, as if he were connecting to the planet itself.\n[This is the power of the Beast General! Witness, and die!]\nImmediately after, thousands or even hundreds of thousands of five meter long sharp, sharp bone thorns sprouted from the ground simultaneously. He had surrounded them perfectly, so that none could escape!\nThey weren’t simple thorns either. Each and every thorn contained a high concentration of darkness magic; they were wicked thorns that threatened to pull one in, stab them, or bind them. This was the Beast General’s (who had become a Thorn Wolf) most powerful technique and magic. And he called it...\n[This is my Garden of Thorns...!]\n\"Tch!\"\nIf Retadane were level 7, then she might’ve died right here. Without even considering their power, the speed at which the thorns moved was much too fast, and their area of effect was much too wide!\nHowever, once she had become level 8, she had become able to perceive and dominate the mana around her, so the moment she sensed a bizarre mana coming from under her, she created a light shield and was able to protect herself.\nLight magic was the magic of severing. The moment the thorns touched the shield, their link to the Beast General was severed; they then returned to pure mana and dispersed into the air. The thorns that hadn’t touched the shield attempted to surround her, but those were also taken care of soon after.\n[Kuaht!?]\nHer light magic affected Jilun Pelta’s main body as well, causing him to stumble. For just a moment, his eyes were filled with fright. Lee Shin Woo realized that light magic was the most frightening type of magic for all undead, no, to all beings that existed. On the other hand, Retadane seemed relaxed.\n\"Did you really think you’d be able to hurt me with that?\" The source of this content ɪs NovєlFіre.net\n[Retadane, your power’s not a good match for mine. Well, that’s fine. I took one down, so no matter how much you struggle, you won’t be able to best me... Huh?]\nThat’s right. This attack wasn’t meant to kill Retadane. It was done to escape this unfavorable 2-on-1 situation and take down the one he assumed to be weaker, the level 7 Lee Shin Woo!\nWhen a hero died, they would be resurrected as an undead, so now it would be a 2-on-1 in his favor. At least, that’s what he had been expecting. He looked at Lee Shin Woo and...\n[He’s not there...?]\n\"...I guess he was able to get out in one piece.\"\nNo matter how great her light magic was, Retadane wasn’t skilled enough to cover both herself and Lee Shin Woo in that short period of time. Because of that, she was nervous that she might’ve lost a comrade, but now that she got a chance to look around, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t there anymore.\n’He was definitely influencing the mana around him with his breathing before... I don’t know how that’s even possible with a level 7 body, but it’s not surprising that he was able to sense the incoming attack and avoid it.’\nIndeed, it was possible for one to avoid the Beast General’s attack, but in here, there was only so long one could do so. He had probably assumed as such and had retreated.\nIt was a really smart decision. The giant thorns covered the battlefield, as though it were field magic, and the effects of the Garden of Thorns were still active. If he had hung around, then he would’ve been caught by the giant thorns and gotten in her way, but the fact that he’d left at the right time was also helpful to her.\n’It kind of bothers me that I’m taking all the credit when we fought him together, but... I suppose I just need to pay him back for all that he did.’\nAround that time, Retadane finished organizing her thoughts and gripped her flail. Her light magic completely encased the iron mace, and its size doubled. She had been using her mana during the battle, but she had enough to overcome the Beast General, who had been battered and used much of his magic to use his most powerful technique.\n\"You look tired, Jilun Pelta.\"\n[You do too... You were only able to hit me with that crude iron mace because of that man. You didn’t know? What do you plan on doing now that that man has run away?]\n\"Hoo. ...I’ll show you.\"\nRetadane completely ignored Jilun Pelta’s foolish taunt, and closed in on him. The Beast General was inwardly screaming, as he was afraid of her light magic, but on the outside, he sported a calm expression while somehow being able to block her attack. But then...\nKwajik!\n[...Huh?]\n\"...?\"\nIt was truly instantaneous... It happened even faster than the activation of the Beast General’s Garden of Thorns. Jilun Pelta and Retadane didn’t know how it happened. Although they didn’t know the cause of it, they were definitely able to see the result...\nWhy? All the thorns that comprised the Garden of Thorns simultaneously struck Jilun Pelta. The sight of dozens, hundreds, even thousands of thorns defying their master was truly a gallant and horrendous sight.\n[What... happened...?]\nJilun Pelta’s body shook. He attempted to control the thorns and extract them from his body, but for some reason, it didn’t work. It was truly bizarre. He was definitely the one who created these thorns, so why were they disobeying him? Why were they attacking not his enemies, but him? Moreover...\n[Why are they even stronger than before...?]\n\"Keuk!?\"\nRetadane briefly felt a chill in the air, and quickly backed off. It was a wise decision. The bone thorns that had stabbed the Beast General blew up all at once! The vibration shook heaven and earth, causing Retdane to lose her balance and fall.\nIt was such a loud ’BOOM’ that anyone on the battlefield would’ve been able to hear it. And what followed was... a short and clear message that conveyed the truth.\n[You have hunted a member of the 12 generals, the Lv7 Beast General, Jilun Pelta! All contributing heroes acquire 30,000,000 Perium, and all stats are increased by 100. You have acquired 10 permits to God’s secret shop. Proficiency in all combat related skills has increased dramatically!]\n\"How is this possible?\"\nIt was the most clear evidence that Jilun Pelta was dead. However, despite her succeeding in taking down one of the 12 generals for the first time since becoming a hero, she wasn’t overcome with happiness, but fear.\n\"What just happened...?\"\nThe Beast General had been ambushed by his own thorns, and then there was the following explosion of top of it. She hadn’t done any of that. That meant that someone else had killed the Beast General without her noticing, even though she had come to him.\nShe couldn’t stop the irrational fear and the curiosity she had. They probably weren’t a hero. There wasn’t anyone amongst the heroes who could do such a thing. It would be impossible for even Ethan Cruz to pull off.\nThen who was it? Who would’ve been able to secretly blow up the Beast General, and why would someone who wasn’t a hero do such a thing?\n\"...Could it be?\"\nAt that moment, she felt a name come to mind. A name she heard recently and quite often. One that attacks other undead, who leads a formidable corps, and possesses boundless strength...\n\"The Heaven Defying General.\"\nShe muttered silently and shook. It was an assumption without a shred of evidence, but the moment she voiced it, she was sure that it was them. The Heaven Defying General must’ve caught whiff of the battle and intervened!\n’I’m scared. I’m really scared... But.’\nIt didn’t change the fact that she would kill them, so long as they were undead. No matter how strong they were, what their character was, or even if she had some sort of deep relationship with them in the past!\n\"No matter what.\"\nShe gritted her teeth and forced her weary body to stand. Now wasn’t the time to being spacing out. First, she would have to collect the Beast General’s loot, and then rejoin the battle.\nRetadane ran over to the center of the explosion site. Because so much mana had been exploded, no other monsters appeared. Were they instinctively afraid? If that’s the case, then they weren’t much different from her. Retadane sneered and checked the loot.\nThe Beast General had dropped a level 5 artifact, and tens of millions of Perium, but aside from that, nothing else was there.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 35 part7",
    "content": "<Chapter 35. The Call of Death - 7>\nLee Shin Woo obviously noticed the Beast General’s skill activation before Retadane. Since he possessed the Rule of Bone skill and was a Breathing Bone Joker, he was more sensitive to anything regarding bones and could react more quickly than anyone else.\n’But this is...’\nHowever, that wasn’t all. The moment he’d created the Garden of Thorns, Lee Shin Woo felt a new possibility. The giant bone thorns had certainly originated from the Beast General, yet he felt like he could control them himself.\nRule of Bone was originally a skill that allowed him to control his own bones and reinforce them. It made him even stronger than before and allowed him to freely use the equipment summoned through the Bone Armory skill.\n’There are exactly 17 thorns coming for me. Their sizes vary, but they’re at least 5 meters. They’re connected through darkness magic and they simultaneously bind their target and inflict persistent damage. It’s a malicious, but also effective attack. I can see it all. I can see it as if it’s only natural...’\nBut it was different now. He instinctively knew how these bones, which were created by the Beast General, looked, their structure, and even how they would move. Lee Shin Woo knew now how he was so easily able to avoid the Beast General’s attacks earlier. It was obvious, wasn’t it? He could understand the Beast General’s bones as well as his own!\nSince that was possible, then it should be possible for him to steal control over them. A hunch and being deluded were two different things. But he was sure.\n[The Rule of Bone skill has become Lv11. All stats have increased by 15. You have become able to interfere with another’s control over their bones. The effectiveness of all bone related abilities has increased.]\nIt was only natural that his skill would level up here. Through it, Lee Shin Woo gained a deeper understanding of bone (the material) and gained the ability to steal control over another’s bones and use them as his own.\nFor now, he would need to split the bones from his main body, like the Beast General’s Garden of Thorns, limit the number of connections, and use his darkness magic as the foundation to control it all, thus requiring a magic technique that was way too complicated. However, if he practiced and further refined this technique, he was sure that he would reach an even higher level. Since most living organisms possessed bones.\n’It sounds almighty...’\n’So if your skill didn’t level up, wouldn’t we have just died without being able to do anything?’\n’You might’ve died.’\n’Yeah, yeah.’\nLee Shin Woo had used his Rule of Bone to get out of the Garden of Thorns and decided to temporarily lay low underground with Jin. It was only possible because the Garden of Thorns had significantly softened the ground.\n\"Damn. It would’ve been nice if the Beast General was level 8.\"\n\"You with your big head as soon as you stand.\"\n\"Even if we wait, he’s not going to become level 8 any time soon... Tch, I guess we should end it.\"\nAlthough he had stolen control over the Beast General’s bones, it wasn’t like he could take him down easily. It was only possible because Retadane was unleashing her light magic to its fullest and blocking the Beast General head on!\n\"You look tired, Jilun Pelta.\"\n[You do too... You were only able to hit me with that crude iron mace because of that man. You didn’t know? What do you plan on doing now that that man has run away?]\n\"Hoo. ...I’ll show you.\"\n\"Yeah, that’s the way, old lady!\"\n\"You keep going and I’ll hit you.\"\n\"Now!\"\nRetadane had done her job well. Once the Beast General focused all of his attention on Retadane, Lee Shin Woo stole control over all his thorns and used them against him. And then exploded them! He had even exploded the Beast General’s magic within the thorns, so the damage inflicted was unimaginable.\n[You have hunted a member of the 12 generals, the Lv7 Beast General, Jilun Pelta! All contributing heroes acquire 30,000,000 Perium, and all stats are increased by 100. You have acquired 10 permits to God’s secret shop. Proficiency in all combat related skills has increased dramatically!]\n[Lucky Strike has activated! The Lucky Strike skill has become Lv2.]\n[The Mana Acceleration skill has become Lv3. Magic has increased by 10.]\n[You have received God’s grace. The Invisible Heart skill’s max level has increased by 10.]\nHe did it. With this, he had killed three of the 12 generals by himself! Lee Shin Woo had also succeeded in turning the situation on its head and made it progress in a direction that Ethan Cruz couldn’t have expected. However, Lee Shin Woo knew that Retadane would be suspicious of him if he appeared before her right now, so he and Jin hid amongst the group of undead. If he used the vibrations, the smoke, and the light from the explosion, then it would be easy to hide. Thɪs chapter is updated by novel·fire·net\n\"What about the bone then? Are you giving it up?\"\n\"Give up the bone of one of the 12 generals? Are you insane?\"\nLee Shin Woo said, and something flew towards him from the center of the explosion. It was the bone that Jilun Belta had left behind. He snatched it and grinned at Jin.\n\"This much is no problem for me with Rule of Bone.\"\n\"Shin Woo. Looks like something came along with it.\"\n[You have acquired the Bayran inner map.]\n\"This again? ...Though it does look a bit different from the last one.\"\nAccording to the other 12 generals’ memories, Bayran was a huge city, directly connected to the capital. They would have to reach it before moving on to the capital.\nI felt natural to gain the Bayran inner map from defeating the 12 generals, but it was also suspicious as well. He couldn’t shake off the feeling that someone was leading him there on purpose.\n’Moreover, the maps all differ in crucial points. They’re all slightly different in terms of the traps and the monster habitats. Even so, they don’t seem to be fakes... I’ll need some more of them before I make a decision.’\nLee Shin Woo was sure that he’d be able to make a proper map with just two more of them. The 12 generals probably don’t think that one person could hold five pieces of the map. He needed to work hard, if for no other reason than to screw them over.\n\"Let’s assume we’ll go to Bayran later and put it aside for now... What are you going to do now, Shin Woo?\"\n\"All the heroes should know that one of the 12 generals has been killed. If Ethan Cruz has something up his sleeve, then he’ll put it out right now. Moreover, there’s a chance that his plan will speed up now. ...So, we’ll keep up with him and prepare as well.\"\nFortunately, they were in the heart of enemy territory. The huge beasts were easily hiding them. It was all too easy for them to hide a single hero. ...And if the 13th general were to suddenly appear from within, then no one would know the reason.\n\"But I think I should absorb this bone right away. Keep an eye out for me while I’m absorbing it.\"\n\"You got it.\"\nHe hadn’t had any expectations before they’d met, but he was sure that he would be highly compatible with the bone, as Jilun Pelta had been able to freely control his bones. So sure that he was willing to execute Bone Reinforcement in the middle of the battlefield!\nLee Shin Woo left everything to Jin, grabbed the bone, discarded any lingering doubts, and executed Bone Reinforcement.\n[Consuming the Lv7 Beast General, Jilun Pelta’s tailbone to execute Bone Reinforcement. Strength has increased by 25, Agility by 30, and Health by 17.]\nAlthough he’d acquired a ton of stats, this was just the beginning. He hadn’t even absorbed half of the bone’s power yet. Immediately after, a huge explosion erupted within his body, as if to prove that. An explosion of creation that broke apart the old and replaced it with the new.\n[The High Rank Combat Sense skill has become Lv4 and Agility has increased by 20. The High Rank Regeneration skill has become Lv3, and Health and Magic have increased by 20. High Rank Lightning Sprint has become Lv4, and Agility and Magic have increased by 20.]\nWith the huge increase in skill proficiency, a few of his skills leveled up and he gained the accompanying stats that came with them. Was it because the Beast General had more actual combat experience than the other 12 generals? The amount of skill proficiency he’d gained was no joke.\nHowever, that wasn’t the end. Not yet. The most important thing remained. Lee Shin Woo felt the mana seethe within him; the torrent of mana made his bones feel as though they would break and explode any moment now. Lee Shin Woo calmly regulated and circulated his mana, and waited for that moment.\nAll of his bones were shaking, and some of them were split and regenerated. At the end of this intense evolution, he got what was he waiting for.\n[The Bone Armory skill has become Lv10. Health and Magic have increased by 20. You can now summon and control ten pieces of equipment at once. All the information of equipment stored within the Bone Armory is shared and reinforced.]\nHe’d finally gained the ability he’d been waiting for. Although they were on the battlefield, Lee Shin Woo wanted to laugh, and there was a good reason for that.\n[You have become able to bestow the equipment stored within Bone Armory with Lv6 Fire, Ice, Acid, or Lightning. However, this excludes some of the equipment that already has an innate element.]\n[You have become able to summon the Lv6 Drake Bone Full Armor.]\n[You have become able to summon the Lv7 Titan’s Fortress.]\n[You have become able to summon the Lv7 Lightning God’s Fury.]\n[You have become able to summon the Lv7 Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatsword.]\n[You have become able to summon the Lv7 Giant Drake Horn Lance.]\n[You have managed to fuse and evolve several pieces of equipment. The Bone Reinforcement skill has become Lv12. You can extract a large amount of information and abilities from a bone lacking in information.]\n’Finally... I finally got it!’\nEverything had most likely opened up for him once he upgraded the Bone Armory skill. The miraculous possibility that came from fusing bone equipment. A piece of equipment that was one of its kind and that only he could create.\nLee Shin Woo raised his head. He switched out the level 5 bone armor he wore with another. His new armor was pitch black, as though it would suck in everything. With the Drake Horn as its base, this armor was created by combining all the advantageous aspects of the bones he’d absorbed thus far.\n[Drake Bone Full Armor]\n[Lv6]\n[Durability - 3,700/3,700]\n[Defense - 1,500 - 1,650]\nIt lacked options, but it would change when Lee Shin Woo added an element to it.\nBefore discussing the elemental aspect, the armor he wore now had a much greater defense stat than the one before, so Lee Shin Woo was incredibly satisfied. But what was even more amazing was...\n’The innate elements of the Lightning God’s Fury and the Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatsword are too strong, so I can’t add any other element yet, but the Giant Drake Horn Lance is different. A level 7 artifact with a level 6 element...’\nHowever, when Lee Shin Woo was about to summon the new Giant Drake Horn Lance and observe it, Rem passed on a brief but powerful signal. Lee Shin Woo stopped what he was doing and looked up. There was something faint that he could see across the sky.\n\"Jin.\"\n\"Yeah, I feel it too.\"\nHe had originally planned to buy some more time, but Lee Shin Woo and Retadane had defeated the Beast General too quickly, so Ethan Cruz’s plan had gone awry. Not properly assessing Lee Shin Woo’s abilities was the cause of his defeat.\n\"The sky...!?\"\n[It is the Vulture General’s airborne undead troops!]\n\"What? Another one of the 12 generals...!?\"\nEthan Cruz must’ve ordered the Vulture General to enter the battle. He had probably forgotten about the two magicians that hadn’t been blessed by him and had run away. And where they were and what they were preparing...\n\"Give them a big one!\"\nLee Shin Woo heard a cute girl’s voice from the faraway mountainside. It was Kratia’s voice, a voice he was more familiar with than anyone’s.\nOf course, it was unlikely that anyone forgot that she existed, but right now, the girls’ magic was more important than whether or not anyone forgot about them. Kratia said something about a ’big one’, but the giant ice spear that manifested in the air was large enough to topple an entire mountain.\n[What...?]\nAn airborne undead caught notice of them... It was probably the Vulture General who had noticed, but it was already too late. Once the battle had begun... No, she had prepared a spell just for him, long before the battle had even started.\n[Kuhahk!?]\n\"I’m here too... I’m going!\"\nPrince followed suit, casting the spell she had prepared. She summoned half of the Fire Demon’s body into the air, wild magic that would strike at any of the airborne undead!\nThe gigantic ice and fire dyed the air and forced these invaders, who had trespassed onto a sacred battlefield, onto the ground. One of them was definitely the Vulture General.\n\"Nice. Good job.\"\nLee Shin Woo confirmed and grinned inwardly. It wouldn’t be a bad idea to depart and kill the Vulture General right away, but... it was about time for the traitors to make their move. After all, his job was to protect these excited kid heroes.\n\"Then, shall we begin Jin?\"\n\"Ok.\"\nJin smiled as well. Although it shouldn’t be noticeable on a skeleton, one could easily tell how the two skeletons were feeling.\nWho had sprung whose trap? A grand festival had begun, one which would determine the predator and the prey.",

    "content": "<Chapter 35. The Call of Death - 8>\nThis battle, the battle between heroes and undead, would determine the fate of the Empire. But there was one discrepancy, a reaper who roamed around the battlefield garbed in black armor.\nIt neither antagonized the heroes nor the undead. However, it moved across the battlefield more diligently than any other, killing all the scapegoats. These scapegoats were none other than the ’undead heroes’.\n\"Here’s where you were, Senior.\"\n[Ah...ahuuah...] Thıs content belongs to noveⅼfire.net\nOnce it heard his cool voice, the man who was once a hero, but now an elite level 7 undead hero shook. This was the fourth of the six ’seniors’ that had been mixed into the battlefield.\n[Give me an order...]\n\"Who could order you, you who was once a hero? Please tell me if there’s a bastard like that out there. Who is it?\"\n[Ah, uaaaaah...]\nLee Shin Woo’s praise flustered the nameless hero. It was like it was undergoing a program error.\nIt was originally supposed to kill the heroes amidst the chaos created by the Beast General’s attack and Vulture General’s ambush, or at least severely injure them, but the heroes had killed the Beast General quickly and retreated. In addition, the Vulture General hadn’t even ambushed them; on the contrary, the heroes had ambushed the Vulture General using large-scale spells, causing the general to fall to the ground.\nTheir plan had gone awry and even their superior, Ethan Cruz was confused as well, so it was only natural that the undead heroes would just stand around awkwardly.\n[Give... me an order...!]\n\"Tch, as I thought, it won’t work.\"\nAfter Lee Shin Woo mercilessly stuck his sword into the undead hero’s head (who kept idiotically repeating the same thing over and over again), he clicked his tongue.\nHe tried to bring them over to his side, as he thought his Instigate and Acting skills might have an effect on them, but because their connection with Ethan Cruz remained strong, even though their egos barely remained, Lee Shin Woo couldn’t break his hold.\nAlthough Ethan Cruz was limited to controlling undead heroes, even Lee Shin Woo had to admit that Ethan Cruz’s hold over them was strong.\n[Give... me an order...!]\n\"...Rest in peace, Senior.\"\n[You have acquired 2 secret shop permits and 17,320,180 Perium.]\n[You have given peace to a comrade who walked a path he could not return from. You have partially cleared the quest objectives, and have acquired 1 secret shop permit. The maximum level of the Invisible Heart skill has increased by 1.]\n’Nice. Now Invisible Heart’s level 143.’\nLee Shin Woo, who had given up on convincing it, killed the undead hero and picked up the bone. Of the undead heroes that were under Ethan Cruz’s control, most of them were ’trash’. Although he immediately used Bone Reinforcement on the recently acquired bone, his stats only increased a small amount and he hadn’t even acquired a skill.\n’In other words, Ethan Cruz didn’t get the good ones.’\n’You sound like the big bad, you know that?’\n’Yeah, yeah. I know. Since I’m the Heaven Defying General. And you’re the Heaven Defying General’s horse.’\n’I’m so happy I feel like I’m going to cry...’\nLee Shin Woo collected the unimportant loot, joked around with Jin, and searched the battlefield for the two remaining undead heroes. But while doing so, Rem relayed a sharp warning.\n[Master, Mentes Orun’s mana is emitting a strange wave. I believe he will soon attack Lloyd H.K. Checking for a secret skill activating that would not be noticed by allies.]\n\"Tch, when it was just getting good... Then again, I knew they’d start about now.\"\nThe Vulture General had fallen from the sky, but half of his airborne forces were still intact. The battle had become even more chaotic due to the master-less beasts attacking and the Vulture General’s troops rushing to rescue their general.\nIf the traitors were looking for an opportunity to attack the heroes, then this would be the best and worse time. If the heroes began to come out ahead, Ethan Cruz wouldn’t have an opportunity to carry out their plan... And naturally, Lee Shin Woo had been preparing for Mentes Orun’s betrayal, ever since he realized that he was moving alongside Lloyd.\n\"Sseup, I guess it can’t be helped. Let’s finish things up quickly. Rem, give me a signal when it’s time.\"\n[Understood, Master. ...Now.]\nOnce Rem gave him the signal, Lee Shin Woo activated the trap he’d set up prior. He displayed his control, which had gotten even stronger, through the hidden and connected mana threads!\n\"You just activated my trap card! Reverse Sword Rain!\"\n’Ah, so you did give it a name like that... Wait, they’re not even swords! They’re not cards either!’\nThe name was hilarious, but the result wasn’t. While the battle was going on, Lee Shin Woo had secretly moved eight bone spears (since he didn’t want to be discovered, he used unremarkable level 4 spears) underground, and once given a target, they would burst from the ground and attack simultaneously.\nThat’s right. These bone spears had been created by the Bone Armory and had been set up before the battle had even begun; he then used Rule of Bone to control them!\n\"Keoheok!?\"\nWhen Lloyd was focused on the fallen Vulture General, Mentes Orun attacked him. He caused Lloyd to drop his weapon and when he was about to land a killing blow, eight bone spears pierced his body and stopped him.\n\"Senior Mentes...?\"\nLloyd didn’t know what was going on and looked at Mentes Orun dumbstruck. It was shocking enough that a senior he trusted so much had attacked him, but right after, his senior had pretty much become a skewered eel! It was too much of a surprise.\n\"What... is this...?\"\n\"Lloyd, you bastard. You didn’t trust me...! How could you do this to me!?\"\n\"I trusted you. You’re the one who betrayed me! Why did you do this? No, how did you turn out like this...?\"\n\"How despicable... You act so innocently, yet... Guwek!\"\nThe skewered eel... No, Mentes Orun stared at Lloyd, who didn’t know what was going on and spat out curses and blood mixed with pieces of his inner organs. Due to the bone spear that had pierced his head from above, his head was bleeding like a fountain.\nIt was truly an absurd event. He had waited for Lloyd H.K. to make a critical mistake and had attacked at the perfect moment. So what went wrong!?\n’Ah, is that it...? When I was sure that my job was finished, all the tension in my body was released...’\nThe predator had been idle and had become the prey instead. Mentes Orun recalled that truth and became despondent. Of course, it didn’t matter whether he was careless or not, the result was the same. Moreover, there was no point in wondering about ’what ifs’ after the fact.\n\"Lloyd... Lloyddd...!\"\n\"Senior, why did you... Huh?\"\nLloyd H.K., who had halfway panicked in front of Mentes, soon found something strange about him. Mentes Orun seemed fine, despite his injuries.\n\"Senior, how are you still... It can’t be?\"\nNo matter how tough a hero’s body was, a hero couldn’t survive having their heart and brain pierced through and all of their blood being expelled from their body. Though Mentes Orun had been pierced by eight bone spears, he continued to curse at Lloyd.\nWas that even possible? Did he have some sort of authority that allowed him to survive with such grievous injuries?\n\"Guaaaah... Lloyddddddddd!\"\n\"Keuk!?’\nHe obviously didn’t. Of course, with God’s power, a skill like that may appear one day, but at the very least, Mentes Orun didn’t have any such skill.\nMentes Orun was just being transformed into an undead through the excessively deep concentration of death energy that permeated the battlefield; the transformation was so natural that he wasn’t even aware of his death. No, his transformation was already complete.\n[Kill you... I’ll kill you...!]\n\"...Ah.\"\nFortunately, Lloyd realized this fact early on. However, that just made him feel even greater despair. Why was God only so cruel to him? Not only had he been betrayed by a senior he trusted in, he had to face that same senior who had become an undead!\n\"Keuheuk... This is... another test.\"\nA tear of blood flowed down Lloyd’s cheek. He grabbed the sword he had lost, stood up, and aimed his sword at Mentes, who was ripping the spears out of his body.\nThere stood a man who had decided to accept all fear and shoulder all the karma of the world.\n\"Senior, I’m sorry. I’m so... sorry.\"\n[Lloydddddd!]\nHe didn’t know why Mentes had attacked him, or who had killed him in the first place. But if he was in pain from becoming an undead, then he would have to give him peace...\nKwang!\n[Kuhek!]\n\"...Huh?\"\nLloyd didn’t swing his sword, and the moment he was about to monologue, the eight spears blew up simultaneously.\nAlthough they were only level 4 bone spears, if Lee Shin Woo concentrated the mana to its limit, exploded them all at once, and aimed for a specific area, then the explosive power would be considerable. At the very least, it was enough to kill a newly born level 7 undead hero, whose body was shaking and pierced with spears.\n\"...\"\nOnce the dust cleared, there was nothing remaining in the empty space. Lloyd just looked on vacantly at the empty space with an indescribable expression, but looking at it wouldn’t explain the situation.\n[You have acquired 2 secret shop permits and 31,842,970 Perium.]\n[You have given peace to a comrade who walked a path he could not return from. You have partially cleared the quest objectives, and have acquired 1 secret shop permit. The maximum level of the Invisible Heart skill has increased by 1.]\nLloyd stood still with a stupefied expression, but at that moment, Lee Shin Woo sighed with satisfaction, since he saw the message that appeared before him. After that, Lee Shin Woo collected Mentes Orun’s bone through Rule of Bone.\n\"Man, I can’t believe I can complete the quest by killing a senior this way.\"\n\"You’re eviler than Ethan Cruz.\"\n\"I just saved Lloyd. I waited for Senior Mentes to become an undead, and when Lloyd was going to do something pretentious, I exploded the spears.\"\n\"That’s what I’m talking about. That’s what’s evil!\"\nThis bastard was definitely punishing Lloyd for the spar! How could you be so immature!? But when Jin was about to criticize Lee Shin Woo some more, Rem relayed another report.\n[Master, I believe Ethan Cruz is attempting to retreat.]",

    "content": "<Chapter 35. The Call of Death - 9 [End of Volume 8]>\n\"What? Ethan Cruz is?\"\n[Yes. To be exact, I see the two remaining undead heroes returning to him.]\n\"Ah... So he’s at least going to try to get out with what he has left, huh.\" ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ NovєlFіre.net\nIn a way, it was his expected course of action. Lee Shin Woo had killed the Beast General, dropped the Vulture General from the sky, and killed six out of the eight undead heroes. What’s worse, Lee Shin Woo had also killed Ethan Cruz’s accomplice, Mentes Orun, so in terms of chess, all that was left was the king and a pawn. It would be strange if he wasn’t retreating.\n\"But... Hmm. There’s no way he’d just leave.\"\n\"Shin Woo, don’t you think you’re the reason he’s leaving?\"\nLee Shin Woo muttered and Jin retorted. Jin believed that Ethan Cruz had done everything he could. If he were to point out a fault of his, then it would be that Ethan Cruz hadn’t properly assessed Lee Shin Woo’s ability beforehand. It seemed obvious, but it was indeed his biggest mistake.\n\"Still, there’s no way he’d just leave. There are still a lot of undead left on the battlefield, and the heroes are still fighting, so the fact that Ethan Cruz is running away by himself means that... he believes he might be exposed.\"\n\"Maybe he thinks he’s already been exposed. Especially since you went out of your way to pick out and kill the undead heroes.\"\n\"No. Any normal hero that can’t use darkness magic wouldn’t be able to ascertain the link between the undead heroes and Ethan Cruz. And so long as they aren’t cognizant of that link, Ethan Cruz will remain as a trustworthy hero. Aside from me, no one else thinks that Ethan Cruz is evil. What’s worse, Mentes Orun didn’t really say much to Lloyd.\"\n\"Then why? Why is he purposely trying to expose himself?\"\n\"That’s... Wait a sec. I think we’ll know soon.\"\nAt that moment, Ethan Cruz had sent him a request for a private chat. Lee Shin Woo was briefly shocked but soon calmed down. Ethan Cruz had no way of knowing that Lee Shin Woo was hostile towards him. So, the purpose of this conversation was...\n\"Senior?\"\n[Ethan Cruz: Shin Woo, I’m glad you’re safe! Are you alright?]\n\"Yes, I’m alright!\"\n[Ethan Cruz: Ooh, that’s a relief. This might sound shameless, but I need your help. Their airborne troops have found me! But I can’t intercept them because of the buff I cast on you... Help me out, Super Rookie. If I die here, then the buff I cast on you will disappear as well! Everything will become a mess!]\n...Aha, as he thought. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo figured out everything. Ethan Cruz was resorting to his last trick.\n[Ethan Cruz: The others are busy fighting, so they won’t be able to help me... I may sound hopeless, but help me out. Come over here as soon as you can!]\n\"I understand, Senior! I’ll go immediately! Please stay safe for just a little while longer!\"\nWith his level 19 Acting skill, Lee Shin Woo replied overly lively and soon ended the private chat. When he looked up at the sky, the airborne troops were circling around the area Ethan was hiding. If someone who didn’t know the situation saw this, then they would truly believe that Ethan Cruz was in danger.\n\"Wait, what happened?\"\n\"What do you mean ’what happened’? He can’t leave it to anyone else, so he’ll step up and do it himself.\"\nLee Shin Woo led Jin towards Ethan Cruz and replied calmly. But because it seemed like Jin hadn’t yet grasped the situation, Lee Shin Woo explained further.\n\"The airborne troops that are circling around... They’re obviously on Ethan Cruz’s side. You know that much, right?\"\n\"Yeah, since Ethan Cruz was the one to call the Vulture General. But I’m surprised that he can still control the general’s subordinates.\"\n\"Yeah, that’s a bit surprising to me as well. Though that’s not important right now.\"\nEither Ethan Cruz and the Vulture General had formed an agreement beforehand, or he had some way of commanding the air troops. The fact that the airborne troops moved threateningly, but didn’t attack Ethan Cruz was the proof.\n\"He’s probably going to make up a lie, saying that the undead heroes that are returning to him are aiming for him. So if I were to naively go and help, then I’ll have to fight against a disadvantageous battle, and once I’m dead, he would revive me as his subordinate... Well, I bet that’s what he’s thinking.\"\nLooking down on the heroes and dispatching two of the 12 generals was a mistake. Therefore, it would be better for him to call each hero individually and take care of them one by one... It was a reasonable conclusion. Ethan Cruz wasn’t aiming for only Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Then why are you going? Are you insane?\"\n\"Jin, you remember that buff... No, that debuff that he cast on me, right?\"\nEthan Cruz had used his darkness magic to cast a ’buff’ on him. It was no simple buff; it was actually a curse that would temporarily increase one’s abilities, and then debilitating side effects would follow. The curse’s evilest ability was its hypnosis effect, and after a certain amount of time, one wouldn’t be able to defy Ethan Cruz’s orders.\nIn other words, Ethan Cruz’s private chat request was no request but was undoubtedly a ’command’.\n\"But that curse didn’t work on you!\"\n\"To be exact, I was able to resist it. ...But that guy still believes that his curse has affected me.\"\nOf course, he could reveal that the curse hadn’t affected him and move against Ethan Cruz. But if he did, Ethan Cruz would immediately dispel the darkness magic link between him and Lee Shin Woo.\nLee Shin Woo didn’t want that. To be more specific, Lee Shin Woo actually wanted Ethan Cruz to cast another curse on him. Hearing that, Jin was dumbfounded and muttered.\n\"I knew early on that you were messed up, but I didn’t think you were this far gone...\"\n\"This was my plan from the very beginning. You got that?\"\nLee Shin Woo was sure that Ethan Cruz specialized in curses. But so long as Lee Shin Woo possessed Darkness Resistance: MAX, there was no way one of Ethan Cruz’s curses would affect him.\nIf that’s the case, then what would be the best way to make use of this? Force Ethan Cruz to give up on cursing him? Make him give up on his darkness magic, forcing him to use plain magic? No, obviously not.\n\"The right answer is: act like I’m affected by his curse, put him into a false sense of security, and then counterattack. If my counterattack is successful, then I’ll be able to inflict a grievous wound, even if he’s a level 8.\"\n\"You fight way too dirty!\"\n\"Just keeping listening.\"\nLee Shin Woo clearly remembered Bisher Moon’s explanation on the Deadly Force curse.\n’Because Deadly Force is such a fatal curse, it has a few downsides. First, it’s difficult to use against those with more magic than the caster. Second, the caster cannot move freely until the target’s death.’\nThe first point probably wasn’t relevant to Lee Shin Woo. Lee Shin Woo didn’t think he could beat a level 8 magician in terms of magic.\nHowever, he could use the second downside. If he could bait Ethan Cruz into using Deadly Force on him, then he’d be able to restrain a level 8 hero! Lee Shin Woo was immune to all curses, so he’d be able to take that opportunity and attack Ethan Cruz.\n\"I didn’t nullify the curse immediately but allowed him to cast it and resisted it. But this was a lot harder to do than I’d expected.\"\n\"You... was the reason you allowed him to curse you because...?\"\n\"Yep. I wanted to become more accustomed to controlling the extent of my resistance.\"\nNot nullifying the curse itself, but nullifying its effects. If that were possible, then Lee Shin Woo would be able to do as he pleased while Ethan Cruz suffered the downsides to Deadly Force. Lee Shin Woo had been training throughout the battle in preparation for this.\n\"...I’m speechless.\"\n\"Yeah, stay like that. Since we’re going to see him soon.\"\nLee Shin Woo explained confidently and patted Jin. Was he alright with that explanation? Jin ran more quickly than before and left the battlefield. He was close enough to Ethan Cruz’s hiding place that he could see it. With Jin’s speed, they would reach it in 5 seconds.\n’Senior Yasunori Akira is still hiding. If he were to attack Ethan Cruz with me once I’m cursed, then it’ll be over in a flash. ...But.\"\nBut there was one thing that was bothering him.\nLee Shin Woo softly sighed. He didn’t really want to think about it, but it was still a possibility. If it was true, then it would become a bit complicated...\n\"Well, whatever. If that happens, I’ll just get three more.\"\n’Three? Why three?’\n\"Senior!\"\nLee Shin Woo didn’t answer Jin and yelled out. He didn’t know if it was because he’d gotten closer, but the circling airborne troops took that moment to descend and attack Ethan Cruz. He almost wanted to applaud at their lively acting.\n\"Shin Woo, you’re not late!\"\n\"Senior!\"\nLee Shin Woo drew his Lightning God’s Fury, cut through the undead, and approached him. Ethan Cruz sported an overwhelming relieved expression and looked at him.\n\"You came to rescue me!\"\n\"Of course, Senior!\"\nLee Shin Woo could give Ethan Cruz’s contemptible smile an 8/10. As he thought, perhaps this guy had the Acting skill as well.\nHowever, he discarded that thought and moved on. Ethan Cruz smiled brightly and spoke.\n\"Even though the curse hasn’t affected you!\"\n\"Tch.\"\n\"Heup!\"\nTo think he’d notice! Hearing that, Lee Shin Woo clicked his tongue. At that moment, Yasunori Akira popped out of his hiding place and attacked Lee Shin Woo. He’d only heard of the style before, Battōjutsu. Yasunori Akira’s strike was so powerful and swift that it felt like he’d be cut in two.\nBut because he shared Jin’s ridiculously high speed stat, Lee Shin Woo’s reflexes and dynamic visual acuity had grown beyond comprehension, so he was barely able to see the trajectory of his strike. And if he could see it, he could block it too.\n\"You were able to block my strike!?\"\n\"Hoo. You know, I want to trust other people too sometimes.\"\nLee Shin Woo blocked Yasunori Akira’s strike with his Lightning God’s Fury (the moment their swords clashed, Lee Shin Woo’s entire body shattered, but through his Acting and Regeneration skills, no one noticed) and sighed.\nWell, of course he’d sigh. Both his plan of using Ethan Cruz’s curse and Yasunori Akira helping him had all gone up in smoke. Honestly, Lee Shin Woo had somewhat expected Yasunori Akira to betray him, but he hadn’t given up on him till the very end.\n’I’d considered the possibility that Ethan Cruz would use Yasunori Akira as well... Since he’d need to know what Retadane would do and prepare accordingly.’\nEthan Cruz knew that Retadane had suspected him. If that’s the case, then he must’ve known that Retadane would eventually approach Lee Shin Woo... as he hadn’t been in this world for very long and hadn’t been approached by Ethan Cruz yet, therefore being trustworthy.\nHowever, Ethan Cruz had planted a spy in preparation for that eventuality. Someone who would meet with Lee Shin Woo and Retadane, and who would report what they were planning back to him: Yasunori Akira.\nThe reason Yasunori Akira had approached Lee Shin Woo first and had warned him about Ethan Cruz was to gain his trust. By doing so, he would be able to manipulate Lee Shin Woo, form a sense of camaraderie amongst him, Retadane, and Lee Shin Woo, and ultimately cause them to believe that he’s their comrade.\n\"Did you know?\"\n\"I said I really wanted to trust you. Are you deaf?\"\nWith that in mind, the reason Lee Shin Woo hadn’t killed Yasunori Akira was because, contrary to Ethan Cruz, there was a chance that Yasunori Akira was ’innocent’. Lee Shin Woo hadn’t been able to discard the chance that Yasunori Akira had approached him out of genuine concern.\nHowever, with this, he was sure. He was definitely on Ethan Cruz’s side. Now he could kill him without feeling any guilt.\n\"Haha, you really are strong. I really like you.\"\n\"You mean you like me enough to kill me and raise me as your subordinate?\"\n\"So you’re aware of it already, Super Rookie!\"\n\"Yeah, that shamelessness really suits you.\"\nLee Shin Woo sighed once more, and completely dispelled the curse. Since Ethan Cruz was already aware of it, there was no reason to carry a curse that wouldn’t be of any benefit to him.\nEven though Ethan Cruz should be aware of Lee Shin Woo dispelling the curse, his expression didn’t change. That meant he had something else up his sleeve, aside from the curses and Yasunori Akira.\n\"You’re really amazing. I really admire you.\"\nLee Shin Woo was surrounded by the airborne troops, the 2 remaining undead heroes, and Yasunori Akira. They came closer and closer, and Ethan Cruz spoke relaxingly.\nLee Shin Woo knew that he was just buying time to completely encircle him, but he decided to play along for now. He also needed to buy a bit of time.\n\"You really made a mess of my plans. I even used Akira, but I couldn’t stop you. I didn’t think you’d create such an impressive plan behind Retadane’s back. Not only did you block my curse, but you also killed Mentes. How did you do it? I still don’t understand how you did it. Ah, you can’t use the chatting channel here, so relax and talk to me.\"\n\"Do you really think I’ll tell you?\"\n\"Mm, yeah. You wouldn’t want to talk. However, you’ll soon change your mind. Once you’ve died and been brought back.\"\n\"Mm... I have something I’d like to say. Want to hear it?\"\n\"Of course.\"\nOnce his encirclement was complete, Ethan Cruz was sure of his victory. He was definitely feeling relaxed.\nLee Shin Woo had expected Yasunori Akira’s betrayal, but he hadn’t expected Ethan Cruz to discover his curse plan. As a result, he had jumped into the mouth of the tiger.\n\"If I was suspicious of Yasunori Akira, then I could’ve made a plan separate from Retadane’s. Have you thought about why I didn’t?\"\n\"I’ve thought about it, but there’s no point in bluffing at this point. Since Retadane is currently fighting against tens of thousands of undead. I assure you... she won’t be able to rescue you before he kills them all. Because that’s her core, her hatred for the undead. She lives only to kill the undead!\"\nIt seemed like Ethan Cruz was also aware of Retadane’s obsession with the undead. Perhaps he had been waiting for Retadane to go deep into enemy lines and go on a rampage.\n\"Mm, you’re right. That’s why.\"\n\"...What?\"\nEthan Cruz was slightly flustered by his calm affirmation.\n\"It’s simple. It means that there’s a part of my plan that Retadane can’t know.\"\n\"Wait a sec. Hey, Ethan. Ethan! I feel a presence... an overwhelming presence! How... all of a sudden!?\"\n\"What are you talking about...\"\nLee Shin Woo grinned and said.\n\"The real battle starts now.\"\nA ’kwang’ sound rang out. The airborne troops began to drop like flies. Was it due to Kratia and Prince’s magic? Nope. Boulders had caused them to drop from the sky.\n[The Great Paul Zero has commanded us!]\n[How dare you challenge his authority! Kill them all!]\n\"G-Giants...!\"\nIt wasn’t just the Giants. There were the level 7 Chimeras, the level 6 golems, and several other elites mixed in as well. The Heaven Defying General’s corps had finally arrived.\n\"Lee Shin Woo, how did you...\"\n\"Who knows? I have no idea what you’re talking about.\"\nLee Shin Woo pulled out an unknown staff and beamed.\nEthan Cruz’s body felt chills.\nDeath was calling for him.",

    "content": "<Chapter 36. What Remains of the Battle - 1>\nEthan Cruz had to prepare two things in order to lure and then kill Lee Shin Woo.\nFirst, he needed to make the battle progress a certain way. Make it so that Retadane and the other heroes wouldn’t be able to easily escape the battlefield. This part wasn’t very difficult. Since all he needed to do was wait for the right moment.\nSecond, he had to create the right environment. He would have to go through a lot of trouble to hide what he was doing from the other heroes. Ethan Cruz had formed a sort of visual barrier that would block out any outsiders from seeing them and simultaneously weaken God’s authority within, disabling the chatting channel and the private chat functions.\nThis was all done in advance so that no matter how much he screamed, no one would be able to hear him. With the secret activation of a magical device, as well as his own magic, the space was restricted from outsiders, forming a complete barrier.\nUnfortunately, that applied to him as well.\n\"How did you summon so many undead...\"\n\"I told you, I have no idea what you’re talking about. Why do you keep asking me?\"\nLee Shin Woo said calmly, acting innocent, but Ethan Cruz broke into a cold sweat. He’d never been this uneasy before, even when he’d met with one of the 12 generals face-to-face!\n\"How can you, a human, control so many undead!\"\n\"Ha. You’re one to talk.\"\n[Annihilation of airborne troops, complete. Awaiting next order.]\n[We have annihilated both of the level 7 undead heroes. Paul Zero, we await your next order!]\nTheir presences were so faint, as if they would vanish into thin air, but their bodies possessed unimaginable power: the golems. Followed by many level 7 elites rapidly appearing behind them.\nThere were several different types of undead (e.g. the Giants and a wolf), but they were all ridiculously strong. Furthermore, they had pledged their loyalty to Lee Shin Woo alone. Seeing that, Ethan Cruz gritted his teeth.\n\"If the other heroes knew about this...\"\n\"They wouldn’t. You were the one who made it like that.\"\nLee Shin Woo ridiculed him coldly. That’s right. Because Ethan Cruz had activated the magical device, this entire area was shrouded in a barrier. Ethan Cruz finally considered a possibility that he hadn’t even considered before.\n\"Did you want this to happen...? You knew that I had prepared a barrier and deliberately let me activate it!\"\n\"I’m the type of guy who prepares a lot of ways to kill someone.\"\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo didn’t want it to go this way, but it was just wishful thinking. If he was the type of person to risk it all on a single chance, then Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t have been able to survive in the Empire.\n\"With these troops... you could’ve attacked me without going through the hassle of coming up with a plan.\"\n\"You’re misunderstanding something here.\"\nLee Shin Woo glanced at the airborne troops and shrugged his shoulders. Through the Giants’ and golems’ stone-throwing, the airborne troops had crashed onto the ground.\nYasunori Akira tried attacking him, but Bisher Moon and Shino Rendu simultaneously blocked him. Both of them were stronger than Yasunori Akira, and he wasn’t able to fight against them for long. Lee Shin Woo could foresee his death the moment Yasunori Akira decided to attack him and step away from Ethan Cruz’s protection.\n\"The reason I stepped foot onto this stage wasn’t to kill you. It was to protect my other seniors. Ah, and to get the rewards for killing the 12 generals. I was able to kill two of them because of you. Thanks a lot.\"\n\"...Ha, hahaha.\"\nWho had been manipulating whom, hmm? Ethan Cruz was completely confused.\nHe’d lost. Completely. Not only had he lost the eight undead heroes, but his spies were either exposed or killed, so his body was all he had left. He had lost everything in just a day.\n\"You hid those sharp fangs of yours... quite well thus far.\"\n\"Would you believe me if I said that wasn’t all I was hiding?\"\n\"Keuk, kuhaha!\"\nEthan Cruz couldn’t help but laugh at Lee Shin Woo’s teasing. Perhaps he wasn’t joking around. Lee Shin Woo was monstrous enough for him to think that way, and he smiled bitterly and muttered.\nHowever, there was one thing he had left. One weapon he could still use. It was himself.\n\"You completely defeated me. I acknowledge my loss. I didn’t know how strong you were, nor did I know about your hidden forces, so it’s only natural that I was beaten so badly. ...But if I get you, then my loss today means absolutely nothing.\"\n\"You’re probably right.\"\n\"Yeah. Let me tell you what your biggest mistake was. That you don’t know what it means to be level 8!\"\nEthan Cruz infused mana into his wrist bracelet. Then, jet-black mana rose up like a mist and surrounded him. The high concentration of darkness steadily dyed the once pure and bright land. This was a level 8’s authority.\n[Keuk...]\n[Ethan Cruz, how can he have such immense power...!?]\nThe undead watched on and instinctively shook, as darkness mana was the root of their existence. Although they knew that Ethan Cruz was a danger to their master, they couldn’t easily advance. His level and power were far too great! Even the level 7 elites stiffened before this darkness, which threatened to cover everything, including their very existence.\n\"None of your undead can use their full strength in here. High Rank Darkness... You probably have no idea what I went through to be able to use this.\"\nLee Shin Woo could use it too, but decided not to say anything. He couldn’t tell him that he could use High Rank Darkness as soon as God had awakened his latent potential.\n\"A level 8 possesses power that surpasses the limitations of mankind. You must’ve prepared a lot, but in the end, if you can’t overcome me with your own power, then you won’t be able to kill me. That goes for your subordinates as well. ...Die.\"\nA lump of darkness flew towards him. ’As expected’, Lee Shin Woo thought, and nodded his head. It was incredibly powerful, even when compared to a fellow level 8, like Retadane.\nEven when he took into account that one was a frontline fighter and the other a backline magician, the difference was huge. ’Perhaps that bracelet strengthened darkness magic,’ Lee Shin Woo thought and extended his staff.\n[Absorbing level 4 high rank darkness magic. Because of how powerful the magic is, strengthening and reversal will take some time.]\nThe serpent opened its eyes.\n\"What!?\"\nEthan Cruz’s darkness magic was powerful enough to instantly kill a level 7 hero. This high rank magic, which was intended to kill Lee Shin Woo, had been absorbed into Lee Shin Woo’s staff.\nBecause of how powerful Ethan Cruz’s magic was, the staff was creaking. However, Lee Shin Woo’s Darkness Resistance: MAX activated, allowing his staff to absorb all the darkness magic. While the staff was able to absorb magic and reverse it, it wasn’t invincible; it couldn’t absorb any and all magic without any repercussions. The Bone Winged Serpent required the user to possess high resistances.\n\"H-How...?\"\n\"Who told you that I could only nullify curses?\"\n\"...!\"\nLee Shin Woo \"innocently\" asked. Ethan Cruz couldn’t even muster up a retort. Since no one had ever said something like that to him before.\nHowever, that was what was happening right now! Although he’d figured out that Lee Shin Woo wasn’t afraid of the curse and was planning on using that curse to attack him, he’d come to the natural conclusion that he specialized in curses alone...\n\"Could it be...\"\nEthan Cruz’s lips shook at that train of thought. He wanted to cancel his spell immediately, but to cancel his spell, he would have to endure the resulting magic explosion with his own body. If he were to cancel his spell, one which he’d focused all of his magic into, then he’d blow up without being able to kill Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Were you... manipulating me?\"\n\"Good answer. I’ll give you a passing mark.\" For more chapters visıt noveⅼfire.net\nLee Shin Woo had been wary of Ethan Cruz from the very beginning. His darkness magic hadn’t been a cause for alarm; he was actually worried about him using his immense magic in a different way. He knew that he was strong enough to hurt him, even if he didn’t convert his magic into darkness.\n\"Ha, haha...\"\nTherefore, he’d manipulated Ethan Cruz. So that he wouldn’t hesitate and use his darkness magic, pouring all of his magic into it.\nThat’s why he’d discussed countermeasures for ’curses’, rather than for ’darkness’ with Yasunori Akira. He’d made him think that Lee Shin Woo was entirely focused on curses. He’d also made it look like he was afraid of darkness magic. The reason he’d brought his undead here was for him to use his darkness magic without hesitation as well.\nEthan Cruz was afraid. He wasn’t afraid of Lee Shin Woo’s magic, strength, or forces. He was afraid of his intelligence.\n\"Lee Shin Woo, how far ahead did you plan...?\"\n\"I wonder. Probably around one or two steps worth?\"\nHe had cast his spell, and that spell had been absorbed by the serpent. The serpent’s wings began to flutter. Ethan Cruz could feel his immense magic being converted into something unimaginable. It was the power he’d been most wary of.\nEthan Cruz knew that the moment that power was turned onto him, he’d be dead.\n\"Are you... really human?\"\n\"Of course I am, Senior.\"\nLee Shin Woo smiled sweetly and replied. He lied till the very end. After all, he was a Joker. Unfortunately, Ethan Cruz didn’t realize that he was lying. Ethan Cruz was devoured by the light shot and soon, was unable to think of anything.\n\"Spatial magic!?\"\n[Paul Zero!]\nBut the moment he suspected that he’d killed Ethan Cruz, spatial magic activated with him as its target. Lee Shin Woo realized that it was the Archmage’s doing.\nHe obviously couldn’t just sit by and let him activate the spell! Lee Shin Woo immediately expelled all of his magic in all directions. If he had fought against Ethan Cruz, then he wouldn’t have this much strength left, but because he’d used his own strength against him, he was almost at 100%!\n\"Nice. I blocked it!\"\n\"You blocked it!?\"\nThat’s right. Lee Shin Woo had succeeded in stopping the activation of the Archmage’s spatial magic! He had dispersed the Archmage’s mana with his own, and had nullified the source of the spell.\nLee Shin Woo had done what would be difficult for any other hero to do so nonchalantly. If he hadn’t experienced the Archmage’s mana firsthand, or had gone to the Giants’ domain, then he wouldn’t have been able to do it!\n\"To think you would be able to nullify spatial magic... I’m speechless.\"\n\"Ah. I desperately stopped it because I thought the Archmage was coming, but I guess it was the opposite. I think he was trying to bring Ethan Cruz to him.\"\n[Kak, Guha...]\nLee Shin Woo looked at Ethan Cruz, who was turning into an undead, and muttered as if he’d realized something. As he thought, Ethan Cruz had been connected with the Archmage.\nIn exchange, he probably had to pledge his allegiance to the Archmage after death, or something like that. There was likely some kind of spatial magic that was applied to him, which would activate once he died. Or maybe he had some kind of magical device. There was a high chance that this barrier was the result of a magical device that the Archmage had given him.\n[Do we kill him?]\n\"Ah, it’ll be a pain in the ass when he wakes up, so make sure he can’t move, and then kill him as soon as he becomes an undead.\"\n[Understood!]\nThe Paul Zero Corps looked at their master, who had killed the level 8 hero responsible for the darkness magic, and replied enthusiastically.\nThirty seconds later, Ethan Cruz died for the second time.",

    "content": "<Chapter 36. What Remains of the Battle - 2>\n[You have acquired two secret shop permits and 1,375,717,480 Perium.]\n[You have given peace to a comrade who walked a path he could not return from. You have partially cleared the quest objectives, and have acquired 1 secret shop permit. The maximum level of the Invisible Heart skill has increased by 1.]\n\"Ha?\"\nLee Shin Woo widened his eyes. It was due to the message that popped up following his execution of the undead Ethan Cruz.\nDue to Lee Shin Woo’s interference (the high concentration of light magic did its part), Ethan Cruz hadn’t been able to transform into an undead properly and died on the spot. Although he’d wanted all of Ethan Cruz’s Perium to remain intact, the amount was...\n\"1.4 billion Perium...?\"\n\"Shin Woo, you just became filthy rich.\"\n\"I would’ve hit the jackpot if Lucky Strike activated... No, never mind that. Is this real?\"\nIf he could, he would’ve rubbed his eyes and checked again, but unfortunately, he didn’t have eyes that he could rub. In any case, he realized the veracity of the message once he opened his inventory. Since all of the Perium he’d received had been stored in his inventory.\n\"Are all level 8s this filthy rich...?\"\n\"Ethan Cruz might’ve been an exception. Maybe he incurred some sort of penalty when using the secret shop.\"\nJin guessed, and Lee Shin Woo nodded his head in agreement. It was likely. Pleine hadn’t liked Ethan Cruz, and it would be strange if he, who acted unlike a hero, would be rewarded by God.\nIt all made sense; he couldn’t use the secret shop for some time and as a result, had amassed an incredible amount of Perium.\n’Moreover... He might’ve been researching the potential behind Perium like me.’\nIt didn’t really matter what he thought though. After all, he was dead now. What was important was that he’d gained 1.4 billion Perium.\n\"I easily have more than 2 billion Perium if I add in what I gained from the battle.\"\n\"Haha, it seems like it was just yesterday that you got so anxious over 1 million Perium...\"\nJin and Lee Shin Woo felt the transience of life and aimlessly muttered. Around that time, Ethan Cruz’s magical device deactivated, and the barrier was finally released. The magical device, which had been buried deep underground, seemed to only be good for a single use, as it broke apart once its task was complete.\n[Master, command me.]\n[Paul Zero, I await your orders.]\n\"That’s right. You guys haven’t done much yet. Alright, then hunt the remaining undead to your heart’s content. Ah, but...\"\nThe heroes would most likely treat all the undead as their enemies. Even if his troops didn’t attack the heroes and only targeted the 12 generals’ troops, it wouldn’t matter. It was likely that the heroes wouldn’t think about it and attack his forces anyway. And the chance of Retadane doing so was 100%.\n\"Go in the opposite direction from the heroes. Be careful of the heroes, and make sure you retreat immediately if I tell you to.\"\n[Understood.]\n[Those fools. It’s quite difficult to even help them.]\n\"The heroes are dumb, so it can’t be helped. Now, all forces, attack!\"\n[Uoooooooooooh!]\nOnce Lee Shin Woo signaled his troops to attack, the Paul Zero Corps advanced! If one were to see Lee Shin Woo commanding his troops, they would feel faint... But unfortunately, the heroes were overwhelmed by the Giants’ overpowering pressure. Besides, they weren’t in a good enough position to be looking elsewhere anyway.\n\"Are those the troops led by the Heaven Defying General...?\"\n\"Why did Ethan Cruz’s buff disappear? Wait, what the hell is going on?\"\n\"Lloyd, Lloyd! Run away with me! We can’t beat them!\"\n\"I-I can’t... We finally started pushing them back.\"\n\"Stop looking elsewhere and focus on the battle.\"\nAll the heroes, scattered around the battlefield, reacted. Even so, three of the heroes had died, so the only heroes left were Seira Von Retadane, Lloyd H.K., Erian Rupate, Prince Altania, and Kratia Melloi. There were only five heroes left.\n[Paul Zero has commanded us! To annihilate all undead who oppose him!]\n[How funny. Watching these stray dogs who have lost their master!]\n[Kill them all! Let’s pay these insects back for betraying us!]\n[Kuhaaaaaaah!]\nBut aside from Kratia, none of the other heroes could stand. Since they’d only been fighting against the undead. The Giants trampled on the skeletons, and the golems emitted their magic, burning the fallen undead. They were all were dumbfounded at the sight.\n\"They’re really... killing the undead.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"We cannot ascertain their true intentions. However, it doesn’t change that they’re our enemy. ...But I think it’d be best if we stay our hand and dispose of them later.\"\n\"Hoo...\"\nLee Shin Woo watched as the Paul Zero Corps entered the battlefield, nodded his head, and picked up the bones. The bones of Ethan Cruz and Yasunori Akira. It was unfortunate that both of them had only dropped one bone each, but there was no helping it. He soon activated Bone Reinforcement.\n[Consuming Lv7 Yasunori Akira’s shin bone to reinforce your shin bone. Agility has increased by 15 and Health by 10. The Mana Acceleration skill has become Lv4 and Magic has increased by 10.]\n[Consuming Lv8 Ethan Cruz’s rib bone to reinforce your rib bone. Magic has increased by 100. The High Rank Mana Bone skill has become Lv4 and Magic has increased by 20. High Rank Darkness has become Lv4 and Magic has increased by 40.]\n\"Ugh.\"\nHe couldn’t have imagined that his magic stat, which had already surpassed 4,000, would increase by 100 all at once. As expected of a level 8 bone. This wasn’t even taking into account Yasunori Akira’s bone.\nWas that all? It even leveled up his high rank skills, which further increased his magic. Lee Shin Woo felt even more magic overflowing from his body and smiled.\n\"See, this is why I can’t stop.\"\n\"Seriously, just stop talking. Everything you say scares me now...\"\nOf course, his abilities hadn’t been the only thing to grow. Yasunori Akira and Ethan Cruz’s memories had merged, flooding his mind with clear memories.\nLee Shin Woo boldly discarded the useless elements, and extracted only the important aspects. Why Yasunori Akira had chosen to ally himself with Ethan Cruz, and why Ethan Cruz had decided to betray his fellow heroes... he ignored such pointless memories. He had no interest in dead men’s circumstances.\n\"Oh, this is it.\"\nAs a result, there was only one thing he could use. It was regarding Ethan Cruz’s contract with the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin, as well as some auxiliary information from that exchange... Information regarding heroes that had died in the past.\n\"I’d somewhat expected this, but it seems like that bastard is controlling undead heroes...\"\n\"Ugh, that’s the worst possible information.\"\nBecause of his quest, Lee Shin Woo could find all of the undead heroes on his minimap, but for some reason, he couldn’t look through the level 5 danger zone. It was likely that the Archmage, or perhaps the Emperor himself, had done something.\n\"Relax. He doesn’t have someone as capable as Ethan Cruz working for him anymore.\"\n\"I really won’t be able to take it anymore if these guys keep popping up... Well, I guess I didn’t really do anything though.\"\n\"Jin, you’re always a lot of help, so don’t down yourself.\"\nLee Shin Woo comforted Jin, who blamed himself for being unable to do anything, and collected the rest of the loot. Yasunori Akira’s equipment wasn’t very valuable (the blade was curved on only one side, like a traditional Japanese sword), whereas Ethan Cruz’s equipment piqued his interest. It was the bracelet-shaped artifact that Ethan Cruz had used when he had attacked.\nThe bracelet was pitch black, as if made of darkness. Due to its simplistic design, one might think it was a cheap trinket, but it was definitely a rare item, as it periodically emitted a black energy. New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on noveⅼfire.net\n[You have acquired the Lv7 Everlasting Night.]\n\"Ah, crap.\"\nLee Shin Woo was bewitched by the enchanting, darkness emitting bracelet, but the moment he came into contact with it, he knew he’d made a mistake. He had forgotten that anything he touched turned into bone! Fortunately, a message came up, stating that Bone Reinforcement wasn’t high enough to convert it, and it hadn’t turned into bone.\nHe felt relief that his item hadn’t changed, and simultaneously felt frustrated that his Bone Reinforcement wasn’t at a high enough level. He convinced himself that it’d turned out well, and checked the artifact’s info.\n[Everlasting Night]\n[Lv7]\n[Durability: 850/850 (Self-Repair)]\n[Magic Attack Power: 2,200 - 2,500]\n[Element: Darkness Lv7]\n[Options: Magic + 150, Calculation Assistance (High), High Speed Casting (High), Accumulation (MAX)]\n[Special passive skills: Night’s Blessing - If darkness magic is infused into this artifact, then its power is amplified and changes the properties of nearby mana close to darkness. Highly increases the success rate of darkness magic. However, you cannot use any other element aside from darkness, and just carrying around the artifact causes you to be weak against light.]\n\"It feels like the ultimate darkness magical device...\"\n\"Seriously, how did you win?\"\n\"It says that he was really weak to light.\"\n\"But your Light Resistance is maxed too.\"\n\"Yeah, you’re right. The penalty is meaningless to me.\"\n\"...\"\nAfter laughing at the speechless Jin, Lee Shin Woo equipped the bracelet on his right arm (under his armor) without hesitation. Since it hadn’t transformed into bone, it was unaffected by Rule of Bone, and also couldn’t be stored in the Bone Armory. However, it possessed a self-repair feature.\n\"Nice. Then let’s give a silent prayer for Senior Ethan, who gave me such a nice gift on his way out. Then, let’s go kill the Vulture General.\"\n\"You demon. You really are a demon...\"\nLee Shin Woo gripped the Lightning God’s Fury, and charged towards the battlefield with Jin.\nAt the beginning, the Heaven Defying General, or Paul Zero had appeared and swept through the battlefield. He had been worried that the heroes would see him, but because his subordinates were here, he came to the conclusion that he didn’t need to look like an undead as well.\n’Retadane’s in worse shape than I thought. Rather than provoking her by showing up as an undead, I think it’d be better to form a bridge between us.’\nThat ’bridge’ would be Lee Shin Woo himself. He would reveal that he’d been saved by the Heaven Defying General and his troops to his seniors, who were repulsed by the undead, and he would then suggest that they form an alliance with the Heaven Defying General.\nThus, the Paul Zero Corps’ participation in this battle was incredibly important.\n[Paul Zero is with us!]\n[Uooooooooh!]\nA few of the dumb Giants yelled out ’Paul Zero’ and took a sideways glance at Lee Shin Woo, but he ignored them for now. He’d already told them that he could disguise himself as a human being, but if he knew they’d act like this, then he wouldn’t have told them...\n\"Ah, Lee Shin Woo!\"\n\"You were safe. You disappeared, so everyone was worried...\"\n\"Senior, we should take care of the Vulture General first! Let’s talk later!\"\n\"A-Alright!\"\nLee Shin Woo safely joined up with the other heroes. He saw the Vulture General, who, despite falling from the sky and losing his mount, bravely struggled as his bald head shined.\n[Keuk, you crazy bitch!]\n\"Huooooooooh!\"\nAnd the one pushing him back was old lady Retadane, who rotated her flail with her eyes wide open. He could hear her gasping, telling him how much she had overworked herself. That girl really didn’t have an off-switch. Lee Shin Woo was speechless, yet still raised his sword high.\n\"Retadane, I’m here to help!\"\n5 minutes passed.\nRetadane’s flail crushed the Vulture General’s shiny bald head, and thus, the heroes had safely killed two of the 12 generals.",

Strength and Magic have increased by 10.]\n[You have received God’s grace. The max level of Invisible Heart has increased by 10.]\nThe Vulture General fought desperately, but he was ultimately killed. His immense power, despite being unable to fight on his own terms, was a reminder that he was one of the 12 generals. However, his opponent had too much of an advantage against him.\nRetadane was not only level 8 but could utilize light magic, which was fatal to all undead. Not to mention that all the heroes had attacked the Vulture General simultaneously. It was amazing that he’d even lasted as long as he did.\n\"I saw it before with the Beast General, but... the rewards are considerable.\"\n\"All stats are increased by 100... Moreover, my combat skills that wouldn’t budge leveled up twice.\"\n\"Hoo... I’m satisfied.\"\n\"Junior! Why did you set me up with this crazy woman... Explain, now. Hey!\"\nWhen fighting against the Vulture General, all the heroes had been focused, but once they were rewarded, their anxiety faded away and they began to talk amongst themselves. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo softly sighed and spoke calmly.\n\"The battle’s not over yet, Seniors. We have to take out the remaining soldiers.\"\n\"Y-Yeah, you’re right.\"\n\"That’s not all.\"\nSeira Von Retadane added firmly, once she’d collected all the loot from the Vulture General.\n\"We may have to face the Heaven Defying General as well.\"\n\"That’s right... They’re killing the other undead right now, but eventually, they’ll come for us...\"\n\"...Seniors.\"\nLee Shin Woo knew that this was his chance.\n\"I was helped by them before.\"\n\"...You were... helped by them?\"\nThe mood turned chilly. The heroes remained silent, except Prince, who looked at him most favorably amongst the heroes. She accepted what he’d said and muttered.\n\"Yes. I was going to die, but the Heaven Defying General helped me, allowing me to survive. I’m surprised and flustered myself, but... the Heaven Defying General told me this: Since our enemy is the same, there’s no reason not to work together.\"\n\"Our enemy is the same...\"\nLloyd interjected this time. He had realized that the only reason they were able to focus entirely on the Vulture General was because the Heaven Defying General’s corps had fought against the undead forces in their stead.\n\"...How can this be? All undead should be completely loyal to the Emperor.\"\n\"He said that they’d escaped his control. That there was a way to escape his control. Apparently, his forces reject the Emperor’s control and they fight against him.\"\n\"There’s no way...\"\nErian and Lloyd were dumbfounded and speechless. Through their experiences in the Empire, they had seen the undead as an absolute enemy, but because they saw the Heaven Defying General’s forces crushing the undead, they couldn’t reject what Lee Shin Woo was saying. Newest update provıded by novel-fire.net\n\"Lee Shin Woo, don’t be fooled.\"\nHowever, there was one person who rejected it without hesitation. As he’d expected, it was Retadane.\n\"They’re all undead. They’re not sane. You cannot believe what they say. It’s an ironclad rule for heroes.\"\n\"But Retadane, they’re really...\"\n\"It’s foolish to believe them just because they’re on our side now. ...Lee Shin Woo, they’re ’fundamentally’ different from us. They’re existences that you cannot communicate with or understand. Even if it seems like you can trust them for now, it’s nothing more than an illusion...\"\n\"...\"\nShe said firmly, and Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly. Of course, Lee Shin Woo knew she’d come out like this, but... her emotional wall was greater than he’d expected and he was a bit hurt by her.\n\"There must be a reason behind them saving you. Perhaps they wanted to analyze us, or perhaps they’re aiming for our God. But you can’t do what they want. All undead must be exterminated. No more, no less. We cannot work together.\"\n\"...Ha.\"\nA sharp refusal, coupled with such hatred. He suddenly realized just how lucky he’d been. Kratia had treated him (and Jin) fairly, without any prejudice, and was kind and genuine. Lee Shin Woo ended up laughing despondently. Then...\n\"You can’t believe what someone says if you don’t trust them. That goes for both the undead and humans. In fact, humans can be much worse.\"\nKratia spoke and refuted Retadane’s statement.\n\"Calm down. Make your decision by using what’s actually happening as evidence. It’s a fact that they’re helping us right now. They’re not attacking us, so there’s no point in being hostile. Above all, we don’t even have the strength to do so right now. Am I wrong?\"\n\"You’re not wrong. If they’re fighting against each other, then there’s no point in putting ourselves in unnecessary danger. A wiser choice would be to use them. Of course, we should analyze them now to prepare for the future...\"\nEven though she agreed with Kratia, Retadane remained suspicious of the Heaven Defying General’s motives and rejected him. As a representative of mankind (a hero), it was perhaps only natural that she acted while thinking so deeply.\nLee Shin Woo was relieved that he hadn’t appeared in front of her in his undead form. He had to think of a way to convince her. It seemed as though Kratia had understood him and said something unnecessary. It was probably intended to console him.\n\"...I believe that there are undead that are trustworthy.\"\n\"You’re thinking along the same lines as Lee Shin Woo. It’s truly unfortunate, but... this is no place to chat. I’ll keep the Vulture General’s loot for now. I’ll divvy it up once the battle is over.\"\nAnd thus, their conversation was over. Her uneven breathing, a result from the intense battle, had somewhat evened out, and Retadane brandished her flail, charging into a gap between the monsters. She crushed anyone in her way, startling the heroes.\n\"Lee Shin Woo, I believe Retadane is right on this. There’s a high chance that an intelligent undead will try and trick us...\"\n\"Senior Lloyd...\"\n\"However... No, never mind. Let’s go fight too. I have no idea what’s going on, but... I know what we have to do right now. We have to fight and come out alive.\"\n\"Lloyd...\"\nLloyd really was amazing. Lee Shin Woo had to acknowledge his fortitude, considering the fact that he remained so pretentious despite experiencing all this. Lloyd consoled Erian, who was clinging on to him. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo inwardly applauded.\n\"I’m going to give him a rougher time next time.\"\n\"Your true feelings are coming out.\"\n\"Hey, Junior!\"\nLee Shin Woo and Jin quietly joked around, and then, someone clung to his back. It was Prince, who for some reason hadn’t followed Lloyd.\n\"Explain! Why did you send me with this woman, and why did you not let me receive Senior Ethan’s buff!?\"\n\"I’ll explain all of it to you later, so please help Senior Lloyd for now. I was helped, but it seems like Lloyd has gone through a hard time. So...\"\n\"Hmph. It’s fine since that elf’s still clinging to him. He expects me to help him, but he doesn’t realize how valuable I am, so I’ll just leave him to suffer...\"\n\"If you just leave them be, then rather than realizing how precious you are to him, wouldn’t he develop feelings for Senior Erian instead? I believe your best bet is getting in between them and stopping that from happening.\"\n\"...\"\nPrince was silent. She realized that Lee Shin Woo had read her like a book. Right after, she quietly asked.\n\"Does... it show?\"\n\"Are you serious?\"\n\"Guaaaaah.\"\nPrince blushed. Her necklace allowed her to disguise herself as a man. Although she was disguised, she was slender and beautiful enough that even he was affected, causing him to softly groan. She was beautiful enough that she wouldn’t lose to an elf’s (Erian’s) beauty. Seriously...\n\"So why do you disguise yourself as a man?\"\n\"There’s something I need to protect, even if I were to lose my life... Ueu.\"\n\"You have it tough.\"\nLee Shin Woo thought it wasn’t any of his business, yet Prince still asked for his help.\n\"...Could you give me some tips? Once the battle’s over.\"\n\"Of course. So please get off.\"\nSince Prince was still clinging to him, he picked her up by the back of her neck like a cat, and lowered her next to Kratia, who had approached with short and quick steps.\n\"Kratia, look after her until the battle ends.\"\n\"Ok. Leave it to me.\"\n\"Keuk, don’t toss me around like baggage... Ah, by the way, Junior, you said you met with the Heaven Defying General. Are you really ok?\"\n\"Yes. He was a good skeleton. So much so that I can trust each and every one of his soldiers.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Shin Woo lightly replied. Although Prince looked displeased, she reluctantly nodded her head.\n\"I don’t trust the undead, but I do trust you, so... Since you trust them, I’ll keep an eye out for them. But you still have to be careful, ok? Since they’re still undead.\"\n\"Haha. Let’s do our best for just a little while longer.\"\nMaybe the more he stayed in contact with her, the less she’d consider the undead enemies? Unlike Retadane, Prince had responded positively, so Lee Shin Woo was slightly pleased.\nHe softly swung his blade and cut down the slowly approaching undead. Then, he left Prince and Kratia behind and turned around.\n\"Then, let’s keep at it for just a bit longer.\"\nHe wanted to test it out. The special passive skill, Thorn Shadow that he’d gained from the Vulture General’s death.\nConsidering the fact that it had neither an intermediate or high rank tag attached to it, it was an incredible skill, just as Pleine had guaranteed. Lee Shin Woo realized how genuine Pleine’s skill book recommendation was. She had robbed him, but this skill was worth ten times, no a hundred times more than the Perium spent.\n’Moreover, the skill’s effect changed a lot too. Originally, Shadow Horn was a special passive skill which buffed all my lunging attacks, but this...’\nA special passive skill possessed the traits of several passive and active skills simultaneously, and unlike other skills, could be applied in a variety of ways... They were skills that essentially had no limitations. And the Thorn Shadow skill was an amazing skill that included that offensive capability.\n’The ability’s simple. I can drag any shadow and turn it into thorns. I can use it even without mana, but the more mana I use, the more powerful the effect. I can even focus that ability into a single point and create a giant horn lance as well...’\nIf a ’shadow’ element existed, then this skill would be representative of the element. It was that amazing.\nLee Shin Woo converted his and Jin’s shadows into thousands of thorns and even fused them together, shocking Jin. It was originally a good skill, but the level was completely different now. This skill would improve both his offensive and defensive capabilities significantly.\n\"You’re already so strong, yet you just obtained a cheat skill like nothing again...\"\n\"Let’s try it out, Jin.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah. I’m going, boss.\"\nLee Shin Woo dragged their shadows, covering both him and Jin with countless thorns, and charged into the battlefield. It didn’t take long for the battlefield, which had been filled to the brim with the undead, to become silent.",

    "content": "<Chapter 36. What Remains of the Battle - 4>\n[Through your plotting, your swindling, your troops, and your comrades, you have achieved the feat of annihilating an undead army. Of the surviving heroes, you have achieved the greatest feat. You have acquired the title, ’Shadow Hero’. All stats have increased by 15. You can now more skillfully hide whatever you wish.]\n[The Thorn Shadow skill has become Lv2. Strength, Agility, and Magic have increased by 5.]\n[The High Rank Command skill has become Lv7 and all stats have increased by 5.]\n\"Retadane!\"\n\"Keuk!?\"\nOnce he’d confirmed that all the 12 generals’ troops were annihilated, Lee Shin Woo stopped Retadane from attacking his Paul Zero Corps. He had stayed near her because he knew that she’d act this way.\n\"Please get out of my way.\"\n\"You can’t fight anymore. You’re exhausted.\"\n\"They’re our enemies.\"\n\"If we don’t attack them first, there’s a chance that they won’t become our enemies! At the very least, you agreed that we wouldn’t fight them today.\"\n\"I changed my mind. I can’t let them go. The undead are... our enemies...!\"\nEven while gasping for breath, Retadane’s red eyes shined sharply, and Lee Shin Woo could clearly feel the swelling killing intent within them. It felt like she would attack Lee Shin Woo as well, if he tried to stop her. Lee Shin Woo was sure that she wasn’t in her right mind right now.\n\"Please... get out of my way...!\"\nWhen they had talked before, she hadn’t said something so reckless. But when she saw the undead nearby, she blanked out and became unruly. There was no difference between her and a brainless undead right now.\n\"Lee Shin Woo, get out of my way!\"\n\"Please calm down!\"\nHer flail came flying at him, but Lee Shin Woo blocked it with a shield he’d summoned beforehand. Although it looked normal from the outside, the Titan’s Fortress (which was now level 7) had changed slightly from the Titan’s Pride. While it didn’t lack in the defense department, Lee Shin Woo didn’t have an answer for the force behind Retadane’s flail.\n’I ordered them to retreat already, so I should just keep her busy until they’ve all left. Anyway... this woman’s really strong.’\nRetadane was level 8, so his Rebellion skill was in effect. Despite the skill buffing his stats, it was difficult for him to block her attacks.\nThe fact that he was being pushed back, despite him reinforcing his body with both the Rebellion and the Rule of Bone skills, meant that Retadane possessed a special ability that reinforced her physical abilities, adding onto the increased effectiveness of her status as a level 8. If not for the other undead, this woman would’ve been able to defeat both of the generals by herself.\n\"How!? You’ve only just hit level 7...!\"\nHowever, Retadane was even more agitated than Lee Shin Woo. A level 7 hero, not one of the 12 generals, was blocking her strike head on; she didn’t even think that was possible. Moreover, she was also using a skill that increased the force of her blows, so she was even more surprised.\n\"Have you calmed down?\"\n\"...Keuk.\"\nRetadane’s blind hatred and rage subsided slightly, perhaps due to Lee Shin Woo’s shocking strength. She realized that if she were to attack the Heaven Defying General (with her weary body), she would die.\n\"Thank you for stopping me... Lee Shin Woo.\"\n[Seira.]\nOnce Seira withdrew her flail and stepped back, one of the undead amidst the Heaven Defying General’s retreating undead, wearing jet-black armor, came forward. Because he had taken off his helmet, Retadane could recognize him.\n\"...Shino Rendu.\"\n[It’s been a long time, Seira. I really missed you.]\n\"To think you’d fall so far and follow the orders of an undead. You’re a disgrace.\"\n[...]\nAmongst the countless species of undead, Shino Rendu was a high rank undead who almost completely retained his living appearance. Because of that, his contorted face stood out even more. Retadane had caused a commotion, attracting the other heroes, and they could see Shino Rendu as well.\n[I still have my own free will. I still hate the Emperor and I want to annihilate the 12 generals as well. The one I follow wants that as well. ...So can we really not fight on the same side?]\n\"We cannot. God demands but one thing from us: exterminating the undead. You’re no exception.\"\n[Seira...]\n\"My name is Retadane.\"\n[...Retadane. Why can’t we understand each other when we both want to save the Empire? Don’t be so biased. Look me in the eye.]\n\"Your premise is wrong.\"\nAlthough Shino Rendu clearly relayed his feelings to her, Retadane’s voice remained frigid. No, it actually seemed colder than before.\n\"I don’t want to save the Empire. So, I’m the only one who can understand myself. You assuming that you know what I want makes me sick.\"\n[...]\n\"You’re my enemy the next time we meet.\"\nRetadane declared coldly and turned around. It was for no other reason, but the fact that she wouldn’t be able to restrain her hatred for the undead if she looked at him any longer. Shino Rendu recognized this fact; he smiled dejectedly and had no choice but to retreat.\n\"Shino!\"\nBut before he left, Lloyd called his name. Shino Rendu stopped. Lloyd hesitated for a while, but ultimately... spoke.\n\"Thanks... for helping us today.\"\n[Lloyd. I’m glad you’re safe.]\n\"...I don’t know. Everything that happened today... it’s too difficult for me to make a decision on my own, but I’m glad I was able to meet you again. ...I’m being honest.\"\n[...Me too.]\n\"...Ah.\"\nShino Rendu smiled sadly and replied. Then, he went back into the Paul Zero Corps and could no longer be seen. Prince belatedly opened her mouth, but it was already too late. He was gone. Retadane looked at the two and said coldly.\n\"It’ll only hurt more.\"\n\"You’re probably right, Retadane. ...Even so, I couldn’t just sit by and do nothing.\"\n\"...I pity you.\"\nEven Lee Shin Woo, who was good at reading people, didn’t know why Retadane had said that. Of course, unlike Shino Rendu, Lee Shin Woo had no plans on overstepping and going through her emotional walls.\nIt didn’t matter what feelings they had for one another, so long as they worked together. If he could control her, then there was definitely a chance that they could work together.\n\"Looking at it now, his army’s tremendous... It’s incomparable to the Beast General’s or the Vulture General’s armies. Just his subordinates are that strong, so how strong is the Heaven Defying General? He’s at least level 8.\"\n\"His army’s not uniform at all. It’s like he’s gathered them from all over the place. Each and every one of them possess considerable strength.\"\nThe heroes watched in shock and awe as the undead collected the loot and quickly retreated. Lee Shin Woo kept an eye on Retadane (as she could go crazy again) so that his army could retreat safely. Fortunately, nothing went wrong.\n[Master, I’m finished verifying. There were a few people watching us, but they won’t come and attack you.]\n’That’s a relief. I have to remain inconspicuous no matter what and hide...’\nBy the time he could barely see his troops, Rem gave his report whilst looking down from the sky. Get full chapters from n͟o͟v͟e͟l͟f͟i͟r͟e͟.net\nHe had caused mayhem. Even if someone were to see him, it wouldn’t be a problem. According to Rem, there were three people currently watching this place, along with the heroes and the Heaven Defying General. Lee Shin Woo could tell where these people came from.\n’The Empire, Steelworker, and... Anti-Skull.’\nThis battle was a sort of ’trigger’. All of these factions felt a sense of foreboding, yet they hadn’t been able to easily initiate the conflict. However, this was the signal for that battle to begin. Each faction knew about each other by now, so they couldn’t remain hidden any longer.\nLee Shin Woo felt the current that he and the other heroes were riding. If he wanted to survive this irresistible wave, then...\n\"I think we should stay out of the limelight for now. Since it’d be easy for us to draw attention right now.\"\n\"I agree. There are too many enemies.\"\nPerhaps Retadane had noticed them, as she spoke with a comparatively calm voice.\n\"However, before that... let’s divvy up the loot.\"\nThe battle was on a large-scale, so the resulting loot was considerable. Everyone was given loot based on their karma. However, the 12 generals still left behind the best loot!\nLee Shin Woo didn’t get much from the Vulture General, aside from some Perium, but Kratia gained his bone.\n\"Shin Woo, I got a present for you.\"\n\"I love you.\"\n\"I know.\"\nKratia discretely gave him the bone and Lee Shin Woo gave her an appropriate amount of Perium in return. Then, he executed Bone Reinforcement without the other heroes knowing.\n[Consuming the Lv7 Vulture General, Bureuche Von Golden Eagle’s parietal bone to reinforce your parietal bone! Agility has increased by 20, Health by 30, and Magic by 10. The Intermediate Assimilation skill has become Lv10 and evolves to the high rank level. Agility and Magic have increased by 20.]\n[With this... Everyone has become bald. Ah, Your Majesty... - Bureuche Von Golden Eagle]\nLee Shin Woo ignored the Vulture General’s ’salty’ memories while checking the increase in his stats and skill proficiency from absorbing the bone.\n[Lee Shin Woo]\n[Breathing Bone Joker]\n[Shadow Hero; 14 others]\n[Lv - 7 (Status effectiveness 250%)]\n[Strength - 2,149 Agility 2,091 Health - 2,222 Magic - 4,408]\n[Passive skills - Acting Lv19, Invisible Heart Lv4/Lv159, Rebellion Lv4, Mana Acceleration Lv4, Thorn Shadow Lv2, High Rank Bursting Thunder Lv5, High Rank Mana Bone Lv4, High Rank Command Lv7, High Rank Assimilation Lv1, High Rank Combat Sense Lv4, Lucky Strike Lv2]\n[Active skills - Disguise Lv7, Instigate Lv8, Bone Reinforcement Lv12, Rule of Bone Lv11, Bone Armory Lv10, High Rank Regeneration Lv3, Sacrifice Lv1, Emergency Evasion Lv6, High Rank Lightning Sprint Lv4, Lightning Shadow Lv4]\n[Elements - High Rank Fire Lv3, Intermediate Ice Lv8, High Rank Wind Lv1, High Rank Acid Lv2, High Rank Lightning Lv4, High Rank Darkness Lv4, Absorption Lv8]\n[Resistances - Holy: MAX, Darkness: MAX, Light: MAX, High Rank Wind Lv1, High Rank Acid Lv2, Intermediate Ice Lv7, High Rank Fire Lv2, High Rank Lightning Lv2]\nWith this, he possessed a total of 10,870 stats. Not only had he been rewarded for killing two of the 12 generals, but he’d also absorbed several powerful individuals’ bones. And in the process, his skills had leveled up as well, causing his stats to increase so much.\nThe other heroes would feel weak if they knew about his stats, but Lee Shin Woo felt like he wasn’t there yet. There were so many powerful individuals in the Empire, so he needed to get to level 8 as soon as possible.\n’I need 1,930 stats until I reach level 8... If I absorb the bones my boys collected, then my stats will increase even further, but for the time being, it’ll be difficult to take down another one of the 12 generals, so I need to move as discreetly as possible... So it won’t be easy. Sseup.’\nThis was why he didn’t want to make any big moves until he was ready, but Ethan Cruz had caused a slight setback in his plans. He’d gotten everything he could from Ethan Cruz, so he supposed that he should consider himself fortunate.\n\"...Shin Woo. Lee Shin Woo?\"\n\"...Ah, yes?\"\nHe was so focused that he didn’t react to Retadane’s call in time and replied a bit absentmindedly. Retadane, looking a bit sheepish (it seems like she was aware of how much trouble she’d caused him), then said.\n\"We should talk about what happened here... Would you like to have a cup of tea with us?\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 36. What Remains of the Battle - 5>\nTwo hours passed. Lee Shin Woo accepted his third cup of tea. Whenever he asked for another serving of tea, Retadane would look enthusiastic, perhaps because of the mood.\n\"Uaaaaah. This is the worst.\"\n\"This doesn’t make any sense. Senior Ethan was...\"\n\"It’s hard to accept, but it’s the truth. When I look back, after being freed from his brainwashing, I feel like there were lots of things that didn’t make sense...\"\nThe heroes were astonished by Lee Shin Woo’s revelation of Ethan’s betrayal. When he added that Mentes Orun was part of this conspiracy, the mood turned for the worst. Especially Lloyd, as he recalled Mentes Orun attacking him and sighed deeply.\n\"Yasunori’s dead and we survived because of the Heaven Defying General...\"\n\"How did things turn out like this... Why did we (the heroes) have to fight amongst ourselves? I feel like an idiot since I fought without being aware of any of this.\"\n\"...Phew.\"\n\"We only killed two of the 12 generals, yet we lost three heroes in exchange. They weren’t even killed fighting against the enemy... Ah, damn. Prince is right. This is the worst.\"\nLloyd, Prince, and Erian were now privy to the circumstances behind the battle and looked as though they were going to cry, yet in comparison, Lee Shin Woo, who had said what he’d needed to say, looked unburdened and drank his tea. To be exact, he acted as though he were drinking the tea while evaporating the tea that went down his throat with fire.\nHe didn’t know this, as he didn’t have the need to pretend to drink tea before, but by swallowing down the tea and evaporating it, he could feel the moisture of the tea, making it feel like he was actually drinking tea. For an undead, who couldn’t eat or drink anything, there was nothing sweeter. ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ NoveI-Fire.ɴet\n\"...Do you like the tea I brewed that much?\"\n\"Yes. It’s seeping into my exhausted body and mind. Thank you very much.\"\n\"...Hehe.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s genuine appreciation caused Retadane to cover her mouth with a hand and laugh in satisfaction. Yeah, this girl got really hyped up over anything related to tea. He smiled bitterly, as she was acting so different from before. Perhaps the way to conquer her was over tea!\n\"You’re amazing, Lee Shin Woo.\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\nLloyd said out of the blue, and Lee Shin Woo tilted his head, as he didn’t know what he was talking about. Lloyd’s face was still ashen as he spoke with a disheartened voice.\n\"It’s amazing that you can be so calm, despite everything that’s happened. You confronted Ethan Cruz, who was level 8, head on and even met the Heaven Defying General... I thought you of all people would’ve been the most tired out of everyone here.\"\n\"I told you this before, but I was already somewhat prepared for this. Plus, I had never met Ethan Cruz before.\"\n\"Moreover, you even blocked Retadane’s strike. ...Were you holding back against me in our duel?\"\n\"No.\"\nLee Shin Woo lied with a serious voice.\n\"I was only able to block her strike because she was so tired. It was after she had fought against two of the 12 generals. I may have gone through a lot, but I didn’t do much and was only helped by everyone else, so it’s only natural that I have so much energy left. That’s why I was barely able to block her attack.\"\n\"No, that’s... Never mind.\"\nRetadane instinctively opened her mouth to refute his point, as she had personally experienced his true strength and thus knew it wasn’t so simple. But she wasn’t able to utter anything after opening and closing her mouth a few times.\n\"You’re still amazing. I stood around like an idiot, but unlike me, you reacted immediately. ...If we had continuously fought against that group of undead, then we wouldn’t be here right now.\"\n\"I’d like to also give my thanks regarding that. ...Since I’ve been fighting the undead for such a long time, it’s become difficult for me to control my emotions when seeing them. That’s actually the reason I didn’t fight the 12 generals, despite having the strength to do so.\"\nLee Shin Woo understood Retadane’s point and nodded his head. Retadane was a lunatic on the battlefield, so much so that the Berserker title would fit her. Regardless of how powerful she was, if she were to fight like a raving madman against the 12 generals and their armies, then she would be killed immediately.\nThe entire reason she hadn’t sustained a critical injury was because she had been with the other heroes. Plus, Lee Shin Woo was publicly and privately supporting her as well.\n\"Retadane. Don’t you feel something is strange?\"\n\"What about?\"\n\"Your absolute hostility towards the undead. The rate at which your anger grows as you fight the undead is abnormal.\"\nLee Shin Woo boldly went straight to the point. The other heroes quieted down, as though they were somewhat aware of her problem as well. Only Kratia was unaware of this, as she tilted her head. Retadane slowly and carefully replied.\n\"I’d be lying if I told you I hadn’t noticed it before. I know it’s unnatural.\"\n\"Then.\"\n\"However, I believe it’s something I need. I don’t plan on rejecting it. It’s not a curse, but a blessing, Lee Shin Woo.\"\nAs expected, she replied with such a psychopathic response. While Lee Shin Woo stood with his mouth shut and dumbfounded, Retadane continued.\n\"There are no humans left in the Underground Empire, only undead. It’s a place where there’s nothing to be happy about, nothing to lean on, nothing. Although we have a few comrades, we cannot trust all of them. You cannot stay sane here. As time passes, it doesn’t get any better, and our enemies are powerful. So, there’s a chance that I’m not the same as I once was.\"\n\"So...\"\n\"So that’s why I’m so thankful. The fact that my hatred, which could’ve faded with time, has remained strong. My hatred keeps reminding me not to forget my original goal. It’s probably a blessing the world has bestowed upon us.\"\n\"The world’s... blessing...\"\nHearing that, Lee Shin Woo realized just how broken she was after so many years.\nHow much hatred did she have and what were the extent of her feelings; she, who had experienced the fall of the Empire? She had shouldered all of that and had survived thus far. Moreover, her unnatural hostility and anger must’ve continuously increased over that time, so it was only natural that she was so damaged.\nTrying to get through to her had been a mistake. Shino Rendu didn’t have any luck either, as he’d tried to get them to work together without reading the mood.\n\"Lee Shin Woo, I know that you’re worried about me. Thank you. However, you don’t need to be worried about me.\"\n\"If you can keep yourself together with that, then... I have nothing more to say. However, as I said before, it’d be a waste to ostracize them completely. There should be nothing wrong with us working together. This is just me prioritizing things. Who we have to be wary of, who we reject, and who we have to take down. You don’t disagree with me, do you?\"\n\"...No. It frustrates me, but you’re right. Let’s take our time to think about that subject. I’d like it if you didn’t deepen your relationship with them too quickly, but... if there’s something to be gained from them, then I’ll be counting on you. You should be able to make contact with them, as you haven’t been so deeply affected by this world.\"\n\"Of course. I’ll take care of it.\"\nIt seemed as though she was satisfied with his response, but her feelings didn’t show on her face. Then, she picked up the kettle and asked Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Would you like another cup?\"\n\"Yes please.\"\n\"...You know, you two.\"\nOnce they were done conversing so seriously and the mood had become more relaxed like before, Lloyd spoke again without reading the mood.\n\"You guys are a good match.\"\n\"Excuse me!?\"\n\"What!?\"\n\"Pfft!?\"\nRetadane was surprisingly anxious. Lee Shin Woo was the same. Wait a sec, how the hell did this conversation go from her emotional problems to relationships!? Just how bad was he at reading the mood!? He supposed it made sense coming from him, as he was stupid enough to mistake Prince’s gender!\n\"Kehek, what the hell are you talking about...?\"\n\"But, Prince. It’s not so surprising, is it? Heroes are people too, so they should be able to fall in love as well.\"\n\"...That’s rich coming from you.\"\n\"Well, I... I’m not really interested and it’s not like anyone likes me.\"\nOnce the conversation turned around on him, he became hesitant, which was pathetic. Erian and Prince looked at Lloyd coldly, as if their eyes were near absolute zero. However, Lloyd shook his head and said strongly.\n\"You just said it yourself Retadane. That there’s nothing to be happy about or lean on. ...But if you fall in love, then both of those issues are solved, right?\"\n\"I don’t think this is the time to engage in such trivial emotions.\"\n\"It’s not trivial. It’s the feeling that leads to birth, and it’s a natural phenomenon. What makes a human being, human is their feelings. You’re keeping yourself together through your hatred for the undead, or in other words, your feelings.\"\nLee Shin Woo was moved, as Lloyd spoke like such a typical hero. Wait, when he thought about it, this wasn’t the time to be doing this. Retadane refuted Lloyd in Lee Shin Woo’s stead.\n\"...Even so, why are you bringing this up now?\"\n\"I don’t think I’ve ever seen you talk to anyone for so long, but you go on and on with Lee Shin Woo. You were trying to hide it, but you’ve been smiling here and there whenever Lee Shin Woo is talking... It seems like you guys really understand each other.\"\n\"That’s... I suppose you’re right.\"\n\"Wait, hold up! So you want our junior to just accept all that crap Retadane is saying?\"\n\"If I was smiling, then it’s because Lee Shin Woo is someone who can appreciate tea.\"\n\"In other words, you’re interested.\"\n\"...\"\nRetadane kept her mouth shut. She had given up on convincing Lloyd. Lee Shin Woo wanted to say ’worry about yourself’, but... in order to maintain some sort of dignity for the both of them, he just lightly replied.\n\"Love can’t be coerced, Senior Lloyd. You realize it on your own.\"\n\"...I just thought you guys looked good together.\"\n\"Haha, you should only say that kind of thing to people who are in love.\"\nJust to be clear, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t capable of love. Because he couldn’t feel it. If he went into specifics, then he’d be miserable, as he’d recall everything he lacked. Lloyd seemed regretful, as he shrugged his shoulders, and Retadane calmed down as well. And for some reason, Prince nodded her head exaggeratingly.\n\"That’s obvious. Don’t stick our junior with that old bag.\"\n\"...Prince Altania?\"\n\"Eek!?\"\nHowever, Lloyd’s words weren’t meaningless. The once gloomy and heavy mood had become a bit lighter, and all the heroes began to smile a little. Lee Shin Woo watched the group of heroes, who had become more energized than before, but then... Kratia came behind him and whispered so that only he could hear her.\n\"Shin Woo, you won’t be able to avoid it forever.\"\n\"Hey, stop with the sudden foreshadowing.\"\n\"I hope you can break through that illusion of yours as soon as possible.\"\nKratia said and smiled subtly. And in return, Lee Shin Woo hit her forehead.\nThe heroes’ repose continued for a little while longer.",

    "content": "<Chapter 36. What Remains of the Battle - 6>\nHad they formed a sense of camaraderie due to the battle? At first, Lee Shin Woo thought he’d be lucky if they didn’t fight amongst themselves, but their rest and discourse went on far longer than he’d expected.\nThis was the heroes’ first experience fighting the 12 generals, defeating them, and being betrayed by their comrades. The only other person besides Lee Shin Woo who could relax, say ’let’s meet next time’, and depart was Kratia.\n\"I feel like my third year was the hardest.\"\n\"If I hadn’t met Prince, then I wouldn’t have lasted so long.\"\n\"You must’ve had it rough, Lloyd. You had to put up with this stubborn boy for so long...\"\n\"Junior, hit her for me.\"\nAnd they even began to reminisce their past. Although they often spoke in the chatting channel, the heroes couldn’t see each other’s faces and speak face-to-face. So, they would quickly go from one topic to the next and remained seated. After all, they didn’t know when they would see each other again.\nMost of the talking was done by either Lloyd or Prince, but if Lee Shin Woo, Retadane, or even Kratia replied, then they would talk for even longer.\n\"What are you guys going to do for dinner?\"\n\"I’m not really hungry...\"\n\"We should rest, rather than forcing ourselves to eat. We killed two of the 12 generals and our stats have increased significantly, so we should prioritize rest to adapt to our strengthened bodies.\"\nNight had come. Ultimately, they decided to rest their exhausted bodies tonight and then go their separate ways. The heroes created tents with their magical devices. He’d seen it often when he travelled with Kratia, but he found it entertaining that the tent matched one’s personality, whether it be the materials or its size.\n\"Shin Woo, are you sure you’re going to be ok?\"\n\"Yes. I’m the least tired. If I get too tired, then I’ll call for you.\"\n\"...I feel ashamed as your senior, but thank you. If you’re tired, wake me up. If for no other reason than for everyone’s safety.\"\n\"Of course.\"\nLee Shin Woo volunteered for the night watch so that his seniors could get a good night’s sleep. It was a battlefield where they had killed two of the 12 generals and slaughtered their armies, leaving nothing behind, but it was for that very reason that they had to keep one eye open.\nOf course, he had no plans on waking Lloyd. There was no point in waking up the exhausted heroes. It also didn’t seem like the other heroes, whose minds and bodies were in tatters, would even be able to take the night watch anyway.\n\"This body’s the best.\"\n\"...It’d be tough without an advantage like this.\"\nOnce they confirmed that the heroes were deeply asleep, Jin spoke. While Lee Shin Woo spoke with the heroes, Jin seemed displeased, as he repeated what he said sarcastically and tapped his body.\n\"You can make me as exhausted as you want, and I don’t care if I have to sleep again. I just want to be human again...\"\n\"Haha. Yeah, I suppose it was too stimulating today, right?\"\nLee Shin Woo thought, ’what a kid’, but then he heard Jin begin to cry. He could understand how he was feeling. Although he was ok with Kratia, there were too many living people around him today.\nHe’d tried to forget about it, but he couldn’t ignore it when so many of them were right in front of him. There were things they just couldn’t do that the heroes could... like eating or sleeping. Lee Shin Woo wondered how he should comfort Jin.\n\"You can smell things too. I’ll put some tea in your body later.\" Thɪs chapter is updated by n͟o͟v͟e͟l͟f͟i͟r͟e͟.net\n\"I’d rather not get wet, so don’t. It doesn’t help.\"\n\"You just don’t know how to enjoy tea.\"\n\"I’m glad you know how. It looked like you were really enjoying yourself with Retadane. Why don’t you actually date her?\"\n\"There’s no point, so don’t say stuff like that.\"\nLee Shin Woo and Jin continued to talk, and before they knew it, it was already dawn. He planned on waiting until the no longer exhausted heroes woke on their own, but Kratia’s tent opened. She walked out while rubbing her eyes. For some reason, he saw Prince fast asleep within Kratia’s tent.\nKratia quickly closed her tent, came out, and sat next to Lee Shin Woo. Lee Shin Woo asked her with a slightly tense voice.\n\"...I didn’t know you guys were in a relationship.\"\n\"I’m going to hit you, Shin Woo. And then I’ll pout.\"\n\"It was just a joke. I’m sorry.\"\nOf course, he had already known that they were sharing a tent. Prince had made her own tent, but Lee Shin Woo had seen her immediately walk over to Kratia’s tent.\nHe didn’t know what they’d talked about, as they had set up a soundproof barrier around their tent, but he assumed that she had a lot to talk about with a female friend.\n\"Shin Woo, I’m going to be travelling with Prince from now on.\"\n\"Huh!?\"\nThat’s why he was so surprised by Kratia’s sudden news. He couldn’t understand how things had gotten so far. What the hell did they talk about in there?\n\"Prince’s level and stats are weaker than mine. In her past life, she could use an innate spell through a contract, and that followed her here, which only makes it seem like she’s strong, but if we can bring out her true potential, then she’ll become a lot stronger. She’s just wasting her magic and talent right now. I thought this before, but I became sure of it today.\"\n\"Mm, I see.\"\nHonestly, Lee Shin Woo had been disappointed by Prince as well. He had been presumptuous, assuming that every magic-related hero would be able to cast unbelievable magic like Kratia.\n\"She’s identified the problem, but she thought it’d be fine until now. Just to be clear, her male disguise is related to that innate spell. It’s a spell that’s been passed down through her family. It’s really complicated.\"\n\"Seems like she has her own troubling circumstances that I don’t want to know about.\"\n\"Yeah, we talked all night. And I had to analyze the spell.\"\nHe’d thought that they were just chatting it up while drinking tea, but it was actually a counseling session. Lee Shin Woo wasn’t just imagining it; Kratia looked a lot more tired than usual.\n\"So I’ve decided to take her on as my student. I regret not being able to travel with you, but... I’ll keep studying what you’ve given me, so don’t worry.\"\n\"I’m not worried about that. I trust you. Anyway, is Senior Prince ok with that arrangement? It’s great that she wants to improve her magic, but she’ll be far away from Senior Lloyd...\"\nAlthough she’d ripped Lloyd (his words) to shreds yesterday, Lee Shin Woo was well aware of how powerful love was. While he wanted to root for her, he couldn’t help but be worried about the distance between Prince and Lloyd.\n\"Mm, I think she’s changed her mind because of you, Shin Woo.\"\n\"But I warned her so that she wouldn’t change her mind?\"\n\"...I think I get it. You’re saying this is all your fault, right?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Yeah!?\"\nLee Shin Woo tilted his head, as he couldn’t understand what she was saying. Jin, who was quietly listening to the side, spoke quietly and nodded his head. He despaired, as Jin understood Kratia better than he did.\nWhen they were about finished, Lloyd woke up, followed by the other heroes. It seems like Prince was the only one still sleeping.\n\"Shin Woo, are you really ok!? I didn’t think you’d be up all night. I appreciate you looking out for us, but you need to take care of yourself a bit better!\"\n\"I know this place quite well. I can easily find a place to rest, so please don’t worry about me.\"\n\"Ugh...\"\n\"You were thinking of us, I see. ...Thank you. I’ll make breakfast. Ruparte, could you please help me?\"\n\"Mm, alright...\"\nAs they had starved yesterday, breakfast was quite fancy. Lee Shin Woo was able to excuse himself from the meal since he needed to keep watch and watched on as the heroes ravenously ate their meals. There was no men or women here. They were all pigs.\n\"Prince, that idiot. Is he not hungry? I’ll go wake him up.\"\n\"Prince is awake and getting ready.\"\n\"Getting ready...?\"\nBecause Lloyd was finished first, he decided to wake up Prince, but Kratia quickly told him not to. Lee Shin Woo had a feeling he knew what was going on, and when the tent opened, they could see Prince. Seeing her, Lloyd dropped the chicken drumstick in his hand.\n\"You... Wait... What...?\"\n\"It’s me.\"\nPrince curtly replied and walked out of the tent. Although she was wearing the same old robes, the curvature of her body underneath them had changed. It was as Lee Shin Woo expected.\nHer face had become softer and her lustrous silver hair hung below her shoulders. Only her red eyes remained the same, but because they fit with her other physical features, they only made her look more beautiful than before. Lee Shin Woo had hypothesized that ’heroes were picked by their looks’ and this just further proved his point.\nThen, Lloyd blushed and yelled.\n\"Are you into cross-dressing as a girl!?\"\n\"I’m not cross-dressing as a girl. I was cross-dressing as a guy, you idiot!\"\n\"What!?\"\nLloyd had known her the longest and hadn’t figured it out all this time, so he really was an idiot. Whereas, Retadane looked disinterested, not caring whether she was originally a man or a woman, and Erian looked as though she understood.\n\"So that’s why you were...\"\n\"Wait a sec. I’m the only one who’s surprised? What’s going on!?\"\n\"It’s not one of his abilities, but whenever I see that kind of reaction from him, he seems like a true hero.\"\n\"Shin Woo, you’re saying ’hero’ like it’s a bad thing.\"\nLee Shin Woo asked Kratia, who was beside him eating corn, how things had turned out this way, and she explained that ’they would be fixing the root of her innate spell’. After her simple explanation, she went back to eating her corn. So, that’s why Prince didn’t need to maintain her spell any longer.\n\"You dimwit. You hadn’t noticed?\"\n\"Ah... My bad. I didn’t think there could be a woman with a personality like yours...\"\n\"Kratia, tie this guy up for me. I want to burn him.\"\n\"Why!?\"\n\"Ok, since it’s my student’s request.\"\n\"What!?\"\nThere was a commotion in the morning, but it ended with Lloyd being burned at the stake. It was almost time for them to go their separate ways. Erian enthusiastically carried Lloyd, who was unable to say anything, while Prince looked much livelier than before, as though she were relieved of a burden and stood behind Kratia.\n\"I hope the next time we meet, we’re all a lot stronger than before. Lee Shin Woo, I may contact you often in the future regarding the Heaven Defying General. I’ll be counting on you.\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"I’ll be level 7 the next time we meet. No matter what. And Prince... Are you really ok with sending the two of us off alone?\"\n\"Hmph, I found what’s most important to me right now, so it can’t be helped.\"\n\"What a splendid expression... I’ll be rooting for you.\"\nRetadane left first. Erian departed in the opposite direction while carrying Lloyd. Kratia and Prince looked disappointed, but ultimately said their farewells and left.\nAs the last one there, Lee Shin Woo briefly closed his eyes and stayed still. He sighed and then spoke. He knew what he needed to do. But first...\n\"I need to go visit the secret shop.\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 37. Heaven Door’s Key - 1>\nIt had been a long time since he’d last visited the secret shop. Beyond the counter, Pleine placed a spoon inside her bowl, which was filled with huge chunks of meat, and then looked at Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Guten Abend! I was just about to eat. Would you like to eat with me?\"\n\"Please don’t do that. Since I was tortured by the other heroes.\" ᴛhis chapter is ᴜpdated by novel·fire·net\n\"Ah, that’s right. I forgot... Wait, Mr. Shin Woo, you’re a human right now!?\"\nAfter they’d gone through their normal routine (it wouldn’t feel normal without it), Pleine noticed Lee Shin Woo’s appearance and was astonished.\nLee Shin Woo finally realized that he’d been maintaining his human form all this time, so he deactivated his Disguise skill. Pleine sighed in relief, which was kind of funny.\n\"I had a suspicion that you could do it, but it really is impressive. Can you eat in that form...?\"\n\"Please keep this a secret from Jin, but I think I’ll be able to if I level up more.\"\nThat’s right. Lee Shin Woo’s Disguise skill had infinite potential. To be more specific, the word ’Disguise’ didn’t accurately describe the transformation; he could feel the skill’s latent potential.\nHe had a feeling that he, a skeleton, would be able to pass off as a human sometime in the future with his Disguise skill. But he couldn’t really tell anyone, as he wasn’t 100% sure. If he gave someone false hope and it didn’t work, then Jin would feel even more hopeless.\n\"Well, if it doesn’t work, there are always other options. Anyway, the other heroes motivated me, so I’ve been thinking about a lot of things.\"\n\"It’s so strange watching you do something you’ve never learned before. What did you do in your original world, Mr. Shin Woo? I heard that magic didn’t exist in that world.\"\n\"I was just a normal salaryman.\"\n\"Yes, yes. I understand.\"\nLee Shin Woo replied honestly, but Pleine shook her head as if she didn’t believe him. Then, she clapped her hands and changed topics.\n\"More importantly, congratulations on your consecutive wins against the 12 generals. It seems like you’ve taken care of Ethan Cruz and the other traitors, so let me thank you personally.\"\n\"Yes. But for the time being, the Empire’s going to be in chaos, so it’ll take some time before we can take care of another one of the 12 generals.\"\n\"You went wild, so I guess it can’t be helped. But it’s not all bad. You knew it was going to happen, didn’t you? It’s good that the heroes were the ones who prompted it.\"\nLee Shin Woo silently nodded his head. Yeah, he didn’t know what the other heroes thought, but he believed this battle came out ok.\nEspecially because they forced the Empire, as well as its opposing factions to act... Although it’d become more dangerous from here on out, there were now more pieces he could use on the board.\n\"But the problem’s whether or not the heroes can adapt to this quickly changing environment...\"\n\"You’re amazing, Shin Woo. You talk about it like it’s someone else’s business. ...Actually, it really isn’t your problem.\"\nThe remaining task was to level up the other heroes ASAP. Those who participated in the battle needed to be strong enough to battle one of the 12 generals one-on-one, and the lowest level newbie heroes, Ye Jin Jin and Silene Viesa, needed to be able to easily take on the highest rank undead, aside from the 12 generals. That would be ideal.\nWhereas Retadane, who was the strongest amongst them, had huge emotional issues. Fixing that would be his most difficult task...\n\"Now that I think about it, your little sister came out unscathed. Though her Berserker vibe kind of scared me.\"\n\"...Ah, you found out?\"\n\"So you were sisters.\"\n\"You tricked me!? How cowardly!\"\nPleine, who realized she’d been tricked, complained loudly, but Lee Shin Woo realized that he’d been correct, muttered to himself, and nodded his head.\nHe’d had his suspicions when he’d first met Seira Von Retadane, but he hadn’t been able to ask her himself. But since he was close to Pleine, it was easy to get it out of her.\n\"Keuk, how did you find out? None of the other heroes who’ve met her found out.\"\n\"You two are alike. I could tell right away.\"\n\"...We’re alike? That’s the first time I’ve heard that since I was born. Everyone else said that we were completely different from each other.\"\nLee Shin Woo spoke, and her expression became odd. Was she happy that she and her younger sister looked alike? He smiled while watching her, but she suddenly frowned.\n\"Being compared to her feels really unpleasant. There are things that even you can’t say, Mr. Shin Woo!\"\n\"!?\"\n\"Who’s prettier, me or her? Please answer honestly.\"\n\"P-Pleine.\"\n\"Good. It doesn’t seem like you’re lying. I’ll forgive this time.\"\nHe felt like his body would break from the pressure of her gaze alone. Of course, he honestly thought Pleine was prettier, but Seira’s body was more his type. However, he wasn’t stupid enough to say that out loud.\n\"Now then, would you like to see our products? A level 7 bone hasn’t come in yet, but would you at least like to see our gear?\"\n\"Ah, I didn’t come here to buy anything today. I came here for some advice.\"\n\"Advice...? Hoo, hoo. If you really wanted to see me so badly, then you could’ve just said so. To be honest, you’re not good enough for me, but if you change your body, then I think you’ll be my type! Good luck!\"\n\"I’m getting mad.\"\n\"I’m sorry.\"\nLee Shin Woo spoke after she’d politely apologized. He wanted to know more about the secret shop permits.\n\"I’ve gathered 131 secret shop permits.\"\n\"Come again?\"\n\"I’ve gathered 131 secret shop permits. Ah, I got the message when I gathered 100 of them though.\"\n\"Hahaha.\"\nHe’d received that message when he was in the middle of a fight. That’s why he hadn’t looked at it in detail and just passed over it, but after he was done with the fighting, the first thing he checked was what he could do with those 100 hard earned permits.\n\"The message told me to ask the secret shop.\"\n\"I’m sorry? Ask the secret shop? Why is it telling you to come here?\"\n\"As I thought, this is the first time you’ve heard it too...\"\nPerhaps Lee Shin Woo was the first one to gather 100 secret shop permits since the secret shop’s inception. He looked at Pleine’s stupefied expression and was sure.\nMoreover, ’ask the secret shop’? When he gathered 10 secret shop permits, he received a message, asking him if he wanted to go to God’s garden. In comparison, this seemed a lot less thought out.\n\"Uah, you really... Mm. In that case... But still.\"\n\"She’s gone crazy.\"\nEither it wasn’t ready yet, or something would be created. That’s what Lee Shin Woo thought would happen, and he was correct. After all, what more proof did he need? Pleine was flustered and communicating with God. Did she finish speaking with God? She soon got a hold of herself, looked at Lee Shin Woo, and grumbled.\n\"...You should’ve told me earlier, you damn hag.\"\n\"Isn’t that blasphemous? Won’t you get weaker or something?\"\n\"Mr. Shin Woo, we’ve come to a conclusion.\"\n\"Ah, ok.\"\nPleine ignored Lee Shin Woo’s question and moved on.\n\"It’s never been done before, but... Mm, I think it’ll work. If it’s you and your partner. It can be used by the two of you. Yes, probably.\"\n\"So what is it?\"\n\"Hoo... I’ll tell you after I’m done eating.\"\nBefore she continued, Pleine touched the stew on the counter with one finger and heated it. Then, she scarfed it down right before his very eyes. She was really going at it, yet Lee Shin Woo still felt some dignity from it, which surprised him even more.\n\"Hoo. Hoooo....\"\nShe had finished eating within a minute. Was it too hot? Her eyes were slightly teary. If she knew that was going to happen, then she shouldn’t have heated it again.\n\"Now I’ll tell you. By using 100 secret shop permits, you gain permission to go to the surface. Of course, it’s not a one-way trip, but a round-trip. It doesn’t sound like a bad idea to take a breather at the surface since the Underground Empire’s in chaos right now.\"\n\"...What!?\"\n\"I said you could go to the surface. You’re the first hero to do so. And you’ll probably be the last.\"\nHe had somewhat anticipated this. However, he didn’t think it’d actually be possible. Lee Shin Woo continued to stare at her, dumbfounded, but that wouldn’t make her explain any further. There were several things that concerned him, but he would have to figure that all out on his own.\n\"What will you do, Mr. Shin Woo?\"\n\"...If I can, I’d like to go there immediately. Let’s go now.\"\n\"Alright. Then let’s call over your partner, Jin Taylor, first. It’s quite easy because of your deep connection.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s tone was serious as he gave the okay. However, Pleine replied nonchalantly, as if she’d expected him to say that, and flicked her hand. He heard a refreshing sound, and right after, Jin appeared right next to him.\n\"Huh? What’s going on? Why am I here?\"\n\"If you have some unfinished business in the Underground Empire, then please tell me now. You can leave right away if that’s what you want.\"\n\"Leave? To where? What’s going on, Shin Woo?\"\n\"Apparently, we’re going to the surface. I’ll explain the details later.\"\nLee Shin Woo was having trouble processing all this, so he couldn’t explain it to Jin right now. For the time being, he needed to listen to Pleine. He briefly used his head. The Paul Zero Corps would be in a safe location and everything else...\n\"Could I bring a small bird with me? It’s a golem.\"\n\"A golem? Ah, that one’s connected to you as well, Mr. Shin Woo. Alright. It’ll cost you 30 more secret shop permits for the round trip.\"\n\"Why don’t you just steal them!?\"\n\"Hoo. It’s not something under my control. I’ll summon it for free, so don’t hate me so much.\"\nSoon, Rem was summoned into the secret shop as well. Rem wasn’t flustered at all and just perched atop Lee Shin Woo’s shoulder, a severe contrast to Jin’s reaction to the summon.\n\"Then, you’re all set now, right? I’ll start right away.\"\n\"Please.\"\nLee Shin Woo rode atop Jin after Rem had perched on his shoulder. He had barely adapted to the Underground Empire yet he was going to the surface now. He didn’t know what would happen, so he prepared himself to be ready for a fight at any moment. Riding atop Jin was one of those preparations.\n\"Hoo... I’m starting!\"\nPleine left the counter and stretched her hands towards the empty floor. Lee Shin Woo felt all his secret shop permits flow into Pleine. The more that flowed into her, the brighter the light shined from underneath them, until it formed an extremely powerful holy magic circle...\n[The Lv8 Bone Gate is activating.]\n\"...Huh?\"\nAt that moment, Lee Shin Woo’s bone ring flew off. Pleine, who was performing the ritual, as well as Lee Shin Woo were surprised and watched. Then, the bone ring swelled in size and stuck to the luminescent floor. And...\n[The Bone Gate is absorbing the magic circle.]\n[The Bone Gate has evolved to Lv9.]\nA miracle happened, one that even God hadn’t expected.",

    "content": "<Chapter 37. Heaven Door’s Key - 2>\nIt was so surprising that Lee Shin Woo fell from Jin’s back.\n\"Pleine, what happened?\"\n\"That’s my line, Mr. Shin Woo... Ah, uaaaah. All the permits are being sucked in!\"\nPleine had already completed her spell, and the fusion between the Bone Gate and the magic circle dragged God’s power, or the permits towards it.\nThe permits flowed from his body, to Pleine, to the magic circle, and then to then to the Bone Gate. That huge flow could no longer be interrupted.\nThe Bone Gate, which had fully fused with the magic circle, radiated white light, as though this was the original plan, and evolved in some unknown way.\n\"What do we do if we can’t go to the surface?\"\n\"...W-We don’t cover already sold goods that are either damaged or fused.\"\n\"Don’t lie! You just made that up!\"\n\"You got me! But you won’t get the permits back even if you kill me, so you have to take responsibility! I didn’t do anything wrong, ok? I really didn’t!\" Fresh chapters posted on noᴠelfire.net\nIt was really frustrating, but she was right. There was no point in blaming her, as this was the result of Lee Shin Woo’s item, the Bone Gate.\nBut the Bone Gate should’ve been dormant within his inventory. The Bone Gate was an item that would remain on standby until he activated it, so why did this happen all of a sudden?\nIf he were to guess, then the Bone Gate and Pleine’s magic circle must’ve had similar properties. It was concerning that the Bone Gate reacted to the secret shop permits, or rather, God’s power.\n\"I got this item from Steve... from a Treasure Eater. So if I find some more Treasure Eaters, would I be able to solve the puzzle?\"\n\"Treasure Eaters are hard to see even once in your lifetime. How many did you kill!?\"\nThere was nothing more Lee Shin Woo’s party could do. He just stood beside Pleine, who was munching on popcorn, and watched the Bone Gate as it changed, no, evolved.\nThe Bone Gate calmed down only after it had absorbed all of his permits. It had fully absorbed the magic circle and began to float in the air.\n[You have acquired the Lv9 ????. By absorbing weak divinity, the artifact has reached its completed form. This artifact will lead you where you want to go. The item will activate upon giving the karma you have created a name.]\n\"Then, how about the Anyway Door...\" [1]\n\"Give it a rest!\"\nJin retorted desperately, stopping him. Lee Shin Woo felt disappointed, but then he gave the artifact a proper name.\n\"Heaven Door’s Key.\"\n\"...I feel like I’ve heard that from somewhere.\"\nHeaven Door’s Key. It was a term in the dead Elementalist’s diary, but he didn’t know what it meant. But for some reason, he recollected that word just now.\nLee Shin Woo instinctively spoke that word, and Pleine briefly looked at him in shock. She soon sported a bitter smile. He hesitated briefly, but then asked.\n\"Does it not fit?\"\n\"No, it’s perfect. ...Yes, nothing else would work.\"\nHearing that, Lee Shin Woo felt relaxed, but at that moment, the level 9 artifact had become complete.\n[The Lv9 Heaven Door’s Key has been born. This artifact, which is connected to your very soul, originally possessed the ability to ignore any obstacle and guide you to where you want to go. However, you are a much lower level than the item, so a part of that function is restricted. If you reach a suitable level, then the artifact’s true power will be revealed. This artifact activates through the consumption of bones and mana.]\n[New coordinates have been recorded. Enough energy has been acquired, so a door can be opened that takes you to the coordinates.]\nAt best, he thought the artifact would evolve and create a door to the surface. Fortunately, that didn’t seem to be the case.\nLee Shin Woo turned to Pleine for confirmation, but she just gazed vacantly at the Heaven Door’s Key. She acted like she’d baked cookies, but a cake came out of her oven.\n\"Then... perhaps...\"\n\"Pleine?\"\n\"An Irregular... A true Irregular... Small singularities overlap, creating a miracle that goes beyond the curse and divinity.\"\n\"Pleine...?\"\nHe didn’t understand at all. Pleine quietly and naturally embraced Lee Shin Woo. As a skeleton, he wasn’t supposed to feel any emotions, but Pleine broke through his defenses and embarrassed him with the abundant feeling. Lee Shin Woo felt his emotions and urges return, things he thought were long forgotten.\nIt was truly shocking. He, who never felt any different from physical contact, felt ’excited’. Who exactly was Pleine? Actually, was she even human? But unfortunately, Pleine hadn’t noticed his dilemma.\n\"You may be able to do it. What even God couldn’t do.\"\n\"Uh... Pleine? I got it, so please calm down and explain.\"\n\"I’m sorry. I can’t explain it to you.\"\n\"Seriously, you really just make up your own rules!\"\nOf course, based on the artifact’s detailed abilities or Pleine’s reaction, he had a rough idea what was going on. But it was so ridiculous that he couldn’t be sure, so he was reluctant to even say it. If what he thought was true, then the situation was ridiculous. He wouldn’t be able to ridicule Lee Man Bok anymore.\nHe suffered in various ways in Pleine’s arms, but Jin, who was left out like a third wheel, was pissed and tore them away from each other, letting them calm down just barely. Both Lee Shin Woo and Pleine.\n\"So are you going to go or not?\"\n\"...Ah, that’s right. I’m sorry. I got too excited. That was unlike me. Ah, maybe that hug wasn’t so bad.\"\n\"I really don’t like this woman.\"\n[She has a unique disposition. Master, be cautious from now on.]\nEven after removing herself from Lee Shin Woo, she briefly thought to herself again, and soon said, ’ok’ and nodded her head. She then spoke to Lee Shin Woo quietly.\n\"You shouldn’t tell anyone about this artifact for the time being. Of course, that includes the people on the surface as well.\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"And the Heaven Door’s Key’s current coordinates are set to the safest place in the Magic Empire. Unlike the Underground Empire, which is brimming with the undead, the surface still has dungeons that haven’t been conquered yet. Plus, the coordinates of those dungeons are much more defined than the ones in the Empire, so as long as you don’t reveal your identity, you should be able to level up much more easily on the surface.\"\n\"That’s exactly what I was hoping for.\"\n\"But please don’t approach the Emperor. The Emperor, who reigns over the Magic Empire, is more powerful than the Emperor underground.\"\n\"...Really?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nPleine nodded her head with a grave expression.\n\"They are afraid of the undead curse, not the undead born from the curse. You know the difference, right?\"\n\"...Somewhat.\"\n\"Good. Refer to this booklet for the rest... Then, please get going. You shouldn’t have any problems no matter who you meet with your silver tongue.\"\n\"I thought you were coming with me?\"\n\"I’d like to, but... Haha.\"\nLee Shin Woo asked seriously, but Pleine just looked at him with a sour expression and shrugged her shoulders. Last time, she’d left and returned from the surface with just three permits, but it seemed like there was still so much she couldn’t tell him.\n\"Alright. Then, see you later.\"\n\"You’re probably already acquainted with some of the other heroes, but if something happens underground, then I’ll tell you immediately. The artifact has enough energy to bring you back, so you should be able to return without much difficulty.\"\n\"Pleine, thanks for helping me.\"\n\"...I’m sorry. Thank you for understanding my circumstances.\"\nOf course, there was a lot more he hadn’t heard from her explanations, but Lee Shin Woo was well aware that she wasn’t hiding the facts because she wanted to.\nMoreover, the fact that she couldn’t tell him anything was proof that he was ahead of schedule. He shouldn’t feel bothered by it; instead, he should just do what he needed to do one by one. The opportunity to go to the surface was invaluable.\n\"Then... I’ll get going.\"\n\"Take care.\"\nAfter he’d said his goodbyes, Lee Shin Woo activated the Heaven Door’s Key. At some point, the artifact had returned to its small ring form, but once Lee Shin Woo willed it to activate, it expanded once more into the form of a gate.\nLee Shin Woo got atop Jin’s back again and caught his breath. He softly placed his hand above his neck. It was the best gesture that would relay both his will and his resolve without making Jin feel unpleasant.\n\"Are you ready, Jin?\"\n\"I was ready a long time ago. ...You’re good too, right?\"\n\"Of course I am.\"\n\"Good. Let’s go.\"\nJin wasn’t an idiot. He knew just how amazing what he’d seen was, but he’d given up on understanding it a lot earlier than Lee Shin Woo. He wasn’t abandoning Lee Shin Woo; he just clearly knew what he could do and what his role was.\n[It’s an honor to be able to take part in this opportunity with you, Master.]\n\"I’m counting on you, Rem.\"\nThe three entered the gate without hesitation. At that moment, the Heaven Door’s Key vibrated immensely, accompanied by radiating light that devoured all three of them.\nThe gate remained for a while longer, but soon there were no traces of it ever existing. Pleine realized that Lee Shin Woo had arrived on the surface and had retrieved the Heaven Door’s Key. She naturally said.\n\"Are you seeing this?\"\n[Yeah, I am.]\nShe could hear the Goddess’s voice in her head. Lee Shin Woo had rudely said that she was possessed, but her communication with the Goddess [2] was much simpler than he imagined. Since the two were deeply connected... Like Lee Shin Woo and Jin’s connection.\n\"You didn’t call him here, knowing that this would happen, did you?\"\n[Yeah. Since even I don’t have the ability to foresee so many repeated miracles. I felt really sorry for the heroes. Of course, it’s not like I didn’t have any expectations for him after turning him into an undead, but I didn’t think he’d figure out a solution. A level 9 artifact... Even I can’t make something like that that easily.]\n\"Still, you’re not entirely blameless. Please beg the heroes for mercy, the ones you called over without even having a solution in place.\"\n[Can’t I just say that everything is going exactly as I planned? If I say that Lee Shin Woo is my new apostle, then...]\n\"There’s no way he’d become your apostle. No one besides Lloyd H.K. would believe that stupid excuse.\"\nPleine sighed deeply and refuted her. Perhaps her firm reply caused the Goddess to sulk, as she remained silent for a moment. Then, she spoke again, as she felt it was pointless.\n[Now all we need to do is kill them all.]\n\"That’s the hardest part!\"\n[We have Lee Shin Woo. He should be able to do it somehow, right?]\n\"You plan on leaving everything to Mr. Shin Woo? Ah, you’re the worst, you old hag!\"\nIn her frustration, she momentarily cut her connection with God. She could, as she possessed her own ’divinity’, although it was inferior to God’s.\nShe soon questioned why she got worked up whenever it had something to do with Lee Shin Woo, but she forced herself to stop thinking about it, as she thought it’d get embarrassing.\n\"I guess I’ll drink some coffee before I sleep. I’m just going to sleep it off.\"\nShe returned to the counter, as if nothing had happened, and boiled some water for her coffee. Pleine soon changed her mind and took out some tea leaves. They were the same tea leaves that Seira had used to brew Lee Shin Woo tea.\nShe boiled the water, let it cool a bit, let the tea leaves steep, and then poured it into a cup. A gentle fragrance wafted from the tea.\n\"If he does kill all of them... that is.\"\nPleine took a sip of her tea and muttered. She couldn’t help but frown.\nAh, she would never get used to this bitterness.\nAs she thought, her family was the worst.\n[1] T/N: Divinity can be translated as holy. Anyway Door is a reference to Doraemon.\n[2] T/N: Toy Car doesn’t use the term ’goddess’ very often. I’m not sure why he makes the distinction here.",

    "content": "<Chapter 37. Heaven Door’s Key - 3>\nThey exited a short tunnel of light and arrived at the surface.\n\"Oh...\"\nLee Shin Woo raised his head, looking at the star filled night sky, as well as the gently shining three moons, and said something stupid, which was unlike him. Each moon was radiating a pale, golden light.\n\"Wow...\"\nJin looked around and also responded stupidly. It was only natural. It’d been about a year since Jin and Lee Shin Woo were transported to the Underground Empire and they had never had the opportunity to look at the sky. So, they couldn’t help but reminisce as they looked at the endless sky.\n\"Shin Woo. Couldn’t we live peacefully if we just stayed here?\"\nWas he drunk from the night sky’s relaxing mana? Jin suddenly said something stupid again. Although he understood where he was coming from, Lee Shin Woo cool-headedly retorted.\n\"If we do nothing, then the curse will eventually reach the surface and it’ll fall to ruin. And it’s not like we can rely on our seniors to do something about the curse.\"\n\"...Yeah, that’s true.\"\n\"But since we’re here, let’s rest in a peaceful spot without any of the undead.\"\n\"Really!?\"\nPeaceful, relax, rest. Just a few hours ago, those words had nothing to do with them. Lee Shin Woo would always either seek an opponent and fight them, or would be engrossed in some effort to better himself.\nSince he was always by Lee Shin Woo’s side, Jin had to remain ready at all times. That’s part of the reason he had been training his Steel Heart or breathing.\n\"Though we’ll need to learn more about the surface first.\"\n\"I know. ...But Shin Woo, what does it even mean to relax?\" Latest content publıshed on NoveI-Fire.ɴet\nJin suddenly asked, and Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly. In order to go to the surface, Lee Shin Woo had disguised himself in his human form and maintained his past life’s expressions.\n\"Another question that’s hard to answer.\"\n\"I know what the dictionary definition is, but...\"\nJin looked at the night sky and said.\n\"For me, relaxing used to be eating and sleeping if I had the time after a contest. Then I’d have the energy to run again. But in this body, I can’t eat and I can’t sleep either. I don’t know what I should do to relieve my fatigue. Does resting even make sense for an undead?\"\nAh, it seemed like he was still affected by his meeting with the heroes. Lee Shin Woo wanted to bring him to the surface for a change of scenery, but it had the opposite effect, making Jin feel even greater despair.\nShould he tell him to stop complaining? No, if he did that, Jin would get discouraged. If that’s the case, then... Lee Shin Woo pondered the ways in which he could comfort his partner and then carefully said.\n\"...There are a lot of other ways to enjoy yourself.\"\n\"So what, you’re going to tell me how to enjoy myself?\"\n\"Yeah, I can do that much.\"\n\"...I see. Thanks.\"\nGood. Fortunately, he chose the right answer! Seeing Lee Shin Woo so relieved, Jin grinned.\n\"You know, you don’t have to always take care of me when I’m acting like a little kid.\"\n\"It’s important to take care of your comrade’s mental health.\"\n\"Comrade... Mm, yeah. ...Is that really enough for me?\"\n\"?\"\nLee Shin Woo didn’t really know what Jin’s muttering meant, but with this, it seemed like Jin was feeling a bit better.\nPerhaps he’d been gloomy because all they’d been doing is fighting recently and they hadn’t had the time to relax and spend time with each other. Yeah, one way to relax was to talk with your comrade like this.\n\"...Mm, however.\"\nLee Shin Woo nodded his head in satisfaction since Jin was looking a lot better. However, he soon realized that this wasn’t the time to be sitting here. They’d been entranced by the night sky’s magic thus far.\n\"Where are we? Pleine told us we’d be transported to a safe location, but she didn’t tell us anything else.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n[Shall I look around, Master?]\n\"I’m counting on you.\"\nRem had no problem seeing in the day or night. Rem flew off into the night sky, and Lee Shin Woo also looked around. He saw trees and thickets around him, so they must be in a forest or the mountains. That was the only thing no different from the Underground Empire.\n[I have found a human city, Master.]\n\"Oh, really!?\"\n\"You’re really quick.\"\nLee Shin Woo got excited all of a sudden. Indeed. Another facet that was different here was that there were living, breathing human beings!\nWhile there was no guarantee that he could really do anything more with humans, it was a far cry from his and Jin’s life of hiding amongst the undead and enduring thus far. So, they felt touched.\nIf they met a lot of humans, then they might despair like before, but even so, they wanted to meet humans, not the undead, living peacefully.\n[It looks like an incredibly large city. It is still lively, even though it is night time. Security is tight as well.]\n\"Really? If this place was deliberately chosen as my starting coordinates, then I’ll have to thank Pleine. ...What should we do? Should we go in right away?\"\n\"Would they accept outsiders at this time of day? Apparently, security’s tight too.\"\n\"We’d obviously go in undetected.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Shin Woo firmly declared. Immediately after, Lee Shin Woo looked at his and Jin’s appearances. Not only was Lee Shin Woo disguised as his human form, but he was also equipped with ordinary armor and a cape. However, Jin was the problem.\nWhen Jin became level 7, his bones became thicker and tougher, while his body became bigger. Furthermore, his Steel Heart armor made him so threatening that it felt like he could snort at a knight and blow him away. Anyone seeing this impressive warhorse would be suspicious of Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Then... Jin... For the time being, you’ll be a pack horse.\"\n\"Why!? I thought you’d be able to turn me into a human with your Disguise skill!? I was waiting in anticipation!\"\n\"Sorry. I can’t turn a horse into a human yet. Instead, I’ll disguise you so that you look like a plump pack horse.\"\n\"I really don’t like this...\"\nTo be honest, it felt like he’d be able to turn him into a human if he stressed himself. Plus, with his contract and the High Rank Assimilation skill, they would be able to share their thoughts with each other. It wouldn’t be impossible to disguise Jin into the form that he was thinking about.\n’But he might be traumatized again if I just transform the outside of his body.’\nJin had endured well for the past few months, but because of everything that had happened recently, his \"mental HP\" was close to zero. He would only turn Jin into a human after his Disguise skill had fundamentally evolved.\nYeah, he couldn’t do it until his Disguise could replicate internal organs, return a human’s sense of taste, and allow him to eat to his heart’s content.\n\"You’re a pack horse, so I’ll be a peddler. We should go around the city. Plus, I have a lot of things to sell. Alright. I’ll be the peddler, Lawrence.\"\n\"Why Lawrence?\"\n\"If you’re a peddler, your name has to be Lawrence.\"\nJin didn’t ask for the details. He knew Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t give him the answer he was looking for, so it was his mistake for even asking.\n\"Then, shall we get going Holo... I mean Jin.\" [1]\n\"What about my disguise?\"\n\"I’m already did it.\"\n\"Huh...!?\"\nJin instinctively looked down at his legs and was shocked once he realized that his legs had changed. That wasn’t all. His body had become smaller, so that he looked like a real pack horse.\nHis stats hadn’t changed, so neither his speed nor durability had changed, but still, there was no way he wouldn’t be surprised. He hadn’t felt anything, yet he was disguised instantly. Moreover, from the outside, his body looked so alive...\n\"My Disguise skill lets you feel the texture and heat of your skin, so we don’t have to worry about getting caught. But you still can’t eat or drink anything, so keep that in mind.\"\n\"Hey, why the hell is a cheat skill like this called ’Disguise’...?\"\nLee Shin Woo just grinned, turned around, and announced.\n\"Let’s go! Rem, find me a way in! I need to go unnoticed!\"\n[Understood.]\nEven if he acted like a peddler and sold goods inside, he would still have to get into the city unnoticed. He would infiltrate the city only after he’d figured out whether they had any surveillance magic, barriers, or specialized flying monsters (like Rem) or golems.\nAnd in only 5 minutes, they easily entered the city.\n\"You said security’s tight?\"\n\"They’re still only level 2 or 3. With Rem’s help, getting in was a piece of cake.\"\nTo be more specific, the surface dwellers were roughly the same level as the undead. Although there were differences amongst the Skeleton Soldiers, they would only reach up to level 3, regardless of how large the city was.\nThe undead soldiers guarding the large cities in the Underground Empire were level 3 elites, but those guarding the large cities on the surface were mostly level 2. There were barely any level 3s, so he could say that the quality of the undead soldiers was higher. The level 3 soldiers were probably high rank soldiers.\n’A person’s species and skills can make the difference, even if their levels and stats are the same. But those soldiers are weaker than the undead, since the undead possess limitless stamina.’\nIt might be different for those with a higher rank job, but normal Skeleton Soldiers were much stronger than the surface’s soldiers. While thinking this, Lee Shin Woo led his precious pack horse and went into the city, mixing in naturally with the other residents.\nBecause he’d observed peoples’ looks and had disguised himself accordingly ahead of time, Lee Shin Woo and Jin didn’t draw any attention as they walked through the street. No one knew that two undead were in their midst.\n’Everywhere I look, there’s nothing but people. Living, breathing people...!’\n’God was so concerned about the curse, so I thought the surface would be on its way to ruin, but I suppose I have nothing to worry about for now.’\nGod’s viewpoint was different from a human’s viewpoint. Perhaps there were dozens of years before the curse spread to the surface. Though that didn’t mean they could just laze around and do nothing.\n’That’s right. First... I need to make sure I can go around like this without any problems. Plus, I might find some fault in the technique.’\n’If you really want to be a peddler, then you’ll need some sort of license... So what are you going to do?’\n’I’ll gather information from around the city. Let’s find some accommodations. Rem, gather some more information at a lower altitude.’\n[Understood.]\nThey found accommodations rather quickly. Although it felt pointless to get accommodations when they didn’t eat or sleep, they couldn’t just walk around all night. Otherwise, they would be ’mistaken’ for the undead.\n\"It might feel uncomfortable, but just be patient for now.\"\n\"A stable’s much better than the wilderness in the Underground Empire. I’ll be resting, so go do your thing.\"\n\"Ok.\"\nLee Shin Woo loosely tied Jin to the stable/storehouse that was attached to his room and then went inside. He’d deliberately picked a place with a saloon and a cafe. He picked a table, sat down, and listened to the drinkers chatter on. He planned on getting some usable information out of them.\n\"The Emperor should’ve summoned the heroes. Rather than being dropped into the Underground Empire and becoming skeletons...\"\n[Master.]\nLee Shin Woo suddenly realized that something was wrong with the hero summoning from the very beginning, but then, Rem abruptly gave his report.\n[I have discovered golems patrolling the inside of the city. I have taken control of them through Mana Parasite, so I believe I can get you all the information you need.]\n\"Ah... Ok. Thanks.\"\nLee Shin Woo quickly canceled his order of vodka, which he’d ordered for cover, and stood up.\nAs expected, perhaps it wasn’t the hero summoning that was the problem, but that the heroes themselves were the problem. Lee Shin Woo tried his best to ignore that very thought.\n[1] E/N: Reference to Lawrence and Holo from Spice and Wolf.",

    "content": "<Chapter 37. Heaven Door’s Key - 4>\nRem had taken control of the golems, all of which were level 4. The golems were responsible for maintaining public order, and would periodically move from area to area. Apparently, every city in the Magic Empire had golems like this and he could easily tell what they were used for.\n’There were more golems that I’d expected underground. They’re not only used for a show of the Emperor’s strength, but to also keep an eye on the lords... With that in mind, I can tell what these golems are used for too.’\n’Was taking control of these golems an irreversible mistake?’ Lee Shin Woo thought briefly, but Rem’s Mana Parasite wasn’t so easily dealt with.\nThe golems would naturally obey his orders once the Mana Parasite took hold. Moreover, the target of their obedience changed in such a way that their original owner wouldn’t notice. After that, they become incompatible with anyone other than Lee Shin Woo or Rem. He knew about this before, but it was an incredibly fearsome ability.\n[This is also the power you created, Master.] ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ NoveI-Fire.ɴet\n\"Mm... Well, I guess it is.\"\nLee Shin Woo, who’d entered his room, perused the book that Pleine had given him (it was some sort of surface guide book) and learned some basic knowledge. The golems gathered information and this information was transmitted to him through Rem, keeping him up to date on the current situation.\nIt detailed the size of the Empire and the names of its cities, as well as the city’s top sellers, the location of the merchant’s guild, and even how to get a peddler license. 5 hours later, Lee Shin Woo finished gathering information and nodded his head in satisfaction.\n\"Yeah, I can do this with my Disguise skill and my Perium.\"\nLee Shin Woo found that the Magic Empire used a currency called ’Enarde’ aside from Perium, based on his information gathering. As it bore the Emperor’s family name, it was highly credible, but it was slightly less valuable than Perium, the absolute proof of karma.\n’I should use Perium in all my deals... There is some good news though. I think I can sell my wine at a higher price than I expected.’\nLee Shin Woo had sold his Kerr Century Wine to Pleine before. She said she’d sell it on the surface, and because of that, the Kerr Century Winery had become renowned throughout the Magic Empire once again.\n’The merchant guild went so far as to stop people from buying the Kerr Century Wine, so I think that says it all.’\nKerr Century Wine was abundant many years ago, so people hoping to attain it assumed that there would still be some remaining and searched all across the Magic Empire. Because of this, the fame of the Kerr Century Wine increased day by day until it became a fantastical artifact in the eyes of the people; a single drop would even cause a dying man to stand.\n\"That’s where this wine comes in.\"\nLee Shin Woo took out a wine bottle that was peacefully sleeping in his inventory. This wine was designed by Lee Shin Woo and manufactured by the golems with the Kerr Century technique and the Dryad’s raw materials. As a result, a truly miraculous product was created, Spirit Wine!\n[Kerr Century Elemental 451]\n[This wine was created by the successor of the Kerr Century Winery, using grapes that have received the love of an elf and the Dryads. It is still technically lacking, but the extremely rare materials bring out a rich fragrance and the right amount of sourness, which hide those flaws.]\n[It is a masterpiece which displays the quality of the ingredients. The magic within the materials continues to ripen the wine even after being bottled. The longer it remains unopened, the more valuable it becomes.]\nLee Shin Woo used the Kerr Century technique and the grapes that had been blessed by the Dryads and an elf to create this wine. This wasn’t just a Kerr Century wine anymore. It was a ’Kerr Century Elemental’, a new blend that Lee Shin Woo had created that was not only vintage, but also hard to value. It would be even harder to value for people without the ability to check an item’s info like Lee Shin Woo.\nFrankly speaking, that wasn’t a problem. Lee Shin Woo was sure that people would recognize its value with just one whiff. If the blend was recognized, then he could make a fortune and establish himself here.\n[Are you going to negotiate with the merchant’s guild, Master?]\n\"No. I don’t really need a Treasure Goblin License from the merchant’s guild.\"\nLee Shin Woo was powerful and was on the cusp of reaching level 8, so whether he was above ground or underground, Lee Shin Woo was at the top. However, he was disguised as a peddler right now, so if he tried selling such a luxurious item, then he would likely become a target.\n\"For the time being, I’ll show them some monster materials and after I’ve gotten permission, I’ll form some connections with the other merchants. Then, after I’ve gotten a proper valuation for the item, I’ll use them to auction it off.\"\n[As expected. I understand.]\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo didn’t think that a roundabout way of selling his goods would completely hide his identity. On the contrary, people might think he’s a spy, which would draw attention to him.\nBut if that did happen, then no one would be able to mess with him in broad daylight. They might try something behind his back, but by then, no one would be paying attention to him, so Lee Shin Woo would be able to take appropriate measures to deal with them.\n[As expected of you, Master. You have become proficient in fighting in way where you go unnoticed.]\n\"Well, you had to be good at that to be a salaryman in South Korea. More importantly, I have an important mission for you, Rem. You know what I’m talking about, right?\"\n[Of course.]\nRem replied confidently.\n[I will use Mana Parasite on all of the golems in the Magic Empire.]\n\"Good. I’ll leave that to you.\"\nIt was much more cost efficient to use a level 4 golem, rather than employing a weaker soldier, as the Magic Empire’s skill in creating golems was at its peak. Thus, the golems were used to protect the cities, supervise various public facilities, patrol, and to hunt monsters.\nWhat did that mean? It meant that Lee Shin Woo and Rem could control the Magic Empire if they put their minds into it. Of course, Lee Shin Woo had no intentions of doing so as of yet. He was still only using them to gather information for now.\n[There is so much prey. I will depart immediately.]\n\"Filter the information and send it to me.]\n[Understood.]\nAs these golems’ masters were already decided, even the Emperor of the Magic Empire wouldn’t expect him to be able to take control of them.\nMoreover, even if he did notice, he had no way of figuring out who the perpetrator was. There was absolutely no risk for Lee Shin Woo and Rem, but there was a ridiculous return on his investment.\n’If there are this many golems in the Magic Empire, then there’s really no point in acting like a peddler...’\nHe possessed 2.3 billion Perium, and he had an informant as well. Although he didn’t need to step out into the light, he had two reasons to do so. First, it was good training for his Disguise skill, and second, to obtain a proper position at the surface.\n’It’d be nice if they can wrap everything up in the Underground Empire without me, but I have the feeling that it’s not going to be that easy.’\nLee Shin Woo knew that there was a reason he was sent to the surface. He didn’t know what kind of expectations God placed on him. However, so long as he was here, he would do everything he could. And that result would surely surpass God’s expectations.\n\"Alright. Then, shall we begin?\"\nAfter he’d sent Rem off, Lee Shin Woo lazily went through his inventory. He was picking out the right materials to show the merchant’s guild, like the level 3 or 4 equipment (which he’d stored because they wouldn’t increase his stats anymore), and some other goods that didn’t turn into bone that would fetch a good price.\nHonestly, these goods were much too luxurious for him to act as a normal peddler. Although he obtained plenty of information from the golems, Lee Shin Woo had an excessively high opinion of the humans on the surface.\nWith that slight misunderstanding in tow, he rushed over to the merchant’s guild the next day. With his precious pack horse.\n\"Hoh, you have such great products.\"\n\"Yes. I was lucky enough to establish a contract with an adventurer.\"\n\"You’re quite talented. We, the merchant guild, welcome you Lawrence!\"\nHe’d only brought out level 3 or 4 equipment, yet he had received so much unwanted attention. Lee Shin Woo was flustered, as he hadn’t expected this to happen, but he somehow managed to move on with his Acting skill and establish his identity as the peddler, Lawrence.\n\"You can commission the guild. What will you do?\"\n\"No, the adventurer... wants me to sell the goods at the highest price. I may not be good enough, but I’ll do it on my own.\"\n\"I understand. I hope it’s not true, but if you’re in an unfair contract, then I hope you won’t hesitate to come for some advice.\"\n\"I’ll keep that in mind. Thank you.\"\nAdventurers sought hidden dungeons or monsters that leave behind valuable byproducts, and were considered similar to mercenaries. At first, Lee Shin Woo wondered which he should pretend to be, a peddler or an adventurer, but concluded that being a merchant would be better to establish a foothold on the surface.\n\"That adventurer, did he find some sort of undead dungeon? Did he just dump all of that equipment on him?\"\n\"You idiot. Didn’t you see that sacred root? Moreover, you only get that much from clearing an entire dungeon. If not, then with that handsome face...\"\n\"They might be a female adventurer. I heard that most of them are sexually active. I don’t know if that weak body is his can take it. Kik.\"\n\"Hey, stop being so rude. Who knows. He might make it big someday.\"\nAlthough he had drawn the attention of the merchant’s guild, he hadn’t drawn so much attention that he’d be put in danger. On the contrary, he thought it’d be helpful in creating connections later on.\nLee Shin Woo greeted the merchants there and made sure he kept his manners. He’d succeeded in showing a good first impression. Some still looked at Lee Shin Woo with disdain, but if they were worried about the level of his goods before, then he had nothing to worry about now.\n\"Newbie, if you need some help, I can give you some advice on how to start your business. How about it?\"\n\"Oh, thank you. Yes, I accept. Of course, I’ll repay you for your help.\"\n\"Ah, so you get it. What a nice junior! Hahaha!\"\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo didn’t need anyone’s help, but if he could spend a bit of money to establish some connections, then he had no reason to refuse. The merchant had no idea what he was thinking and just laughed uproariously, but there was someone that worried about Lee Shin Woo. That was his pack horse, Jin.\n’That guy... It’s obvious he’s planning something. Even I can tell... Will you be ok?’\n’I’ll be fine. In fact, it’s actually better for me. I can use a stupid guy like this as a shield later.’\n’...Do all salarymen learn techniques like that?’\n’Of course they do.’\nA week passed.\nLee Shin Woo’s Disguise skill had become level 8, and Rem had managed to control a tenth of the Magic Empire’s golems.\nLee Shin decided to auction off his wine in a month.",

    "content": "<Chapter 38. The Peddler and the Adventurer - 1>\n[Master, the level of Mana Parasite has risen, increasing its functionality.]\n’Mm?’\nIt had been ten days since Lee Shin Woo had snuck into the large city, ’Kuroa’s Glory’ and had begun acting as the peddler, Lawrence. Another merchant was right about to sign his contract, but Rem chose that time to give its report.\n’The level rose?’\n[That’s correct. The skill has leveled up before, decreasing the mana consumption and increasing its speed, but this time, it gained an additional ability... It occurred when the skill reached level 5.]\n’Wait a sec. Give me the details a bit later.’\nMana Parasite was paramount to achieving his goal on the surface, so Lee Shin Woo couldn’t afford to ignore Rem’s report. However, now wasn’t the time. The merchant was right about to sign the contract, but he looked at Lee Shin Woo anxiously.\n\"Is there something wrong with the contract?\"\n\"I’m sorry. I just remembered something important... Yes, you’re all set. The confidentiality clause is perfect as well. It’s done.\"\n\"Hoo.\"\nThe merchant sighed in relief. The contract referred to the wine auction. He’d hired a few trustworthy merchants among the ones he’d befriended in the past ten days, and put them in charge of setting up the auction, promoting it, and running it.\nIn layman’s terms, they would do miscellaneous tasks and act as his ’shields’, since he came out of nowhere and had hundreds of bottles of expensive wine. He’d promised to pay them, so the merchants pleasantly agreed.\n\"Then, I’ll be counting on you for a month. You can send your regular reports to my accommodations.\" ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ Nove1Fire.net\n\"That’s my line.\"\nHe thought he’d be interrogated, but the merchant didn’t do so, and instead just picked up the contract. Lee Shin Woo had picked him for this very reason, so he supposed it was only natural.\nLee Shin Woo picked up his own contract and perused it again. After that, he slightly nodded his head and left. He was now being rewarded for acting as a peddler for ten days. He wouldn’t have to worry about it for the time being.\n\"So what’s the new ability?\"\n[Infection.]\n\"Infection...\"\nOnce Lee Shin Woo was alone, he followed up with Rem. Rem explained the new ability with a single, concise word. Lee Shin Woo understood what it did immediately.\n\"As expected, it goes from a contagion to an infection.\"\n[Exactly. Master, you must be aware of the fact that golems produced for the same purpose and stationed in the same area, are connected like a network of sorts.]\nArema Steelworker’s golems were like that. According to Rem, the technique used to make the golems here and the ones underground were the same, so early on, he’d figured that the Magic Empire’s golems would be connected like a network.\n[I am now able to secretly infect all the golems in the network if I just infect a few of them. If the ability grows even further, then I should be able to infect other golem networks as well.]\n\"That’s...\"\nThat’s a virus! Lee Shin Woo knew how dangerous Rem was. If this technique worked on humans, then it would be game over. This wasn’t a hero’s ability; it was a demon king’s! What’s worse, the Magic Empire had golems everywhere, so it was pretty much already game over.\nHe’d only brought Rem along to help him out, but never thought that that trivial decision would’ve made such a difference!\n\"Good job, Rem. Go wild. Infect them all.\"\n[Understood.]\nEven so, Lee Shin Woo unhesitatingly yelled ’go’. Since there was no possibility of danger, he didn’t plan on stopping, no matter what happened afterwards. He would worry about world peace after he was completely safe!\n[According to the network’s information sharing, there are at least 50 level 7 golems in the capital, Enart. If I manage to infect them as well, then you should be able to move more freely. I believe we will be able to hold the Emperor at bay...]\n\"You can infect level 7 golems too?\"\n[It’s difficult to infect them myself, but if I infect them through the capital’s network, then there’s a high chance for success. If the Mana Parasite levels up even further, then the likelihood increases even more.]\n\"What are the chances the Emperor finds out?\"\n[No one will find out about the infection. I assure you.]\n\"...Good. I’m counting on you.\"\n[I will begin right away.]\nAfter it finished its report, Lee Shin Woo thought that perhaps Rem, out of all of them, was the busiest, but for some reason, decided to ignore it. Since he was doing his best too.\n\"Why do you keep looking at me?\"\n\"I wasn’t looking.\"\nLee Shin Woo led his sharp witted pack horse and hit the road.\nHe’d gotten rid of all his useless items in the past ten days, so he needed a new supply, but because he wasn’t a real merchant, he didn’t need to buy local products. Then how would he fill his inventory? What would he fill it with? There was only one choice.\n\"We’re going to clear a new dungeon.\"\n\"But dungeons aren’t common.\"\n\"Including the golems guarding and patrolling this city, there are thousands of golems infected. Do you really think they wouldn’t have any info regarding the dungeons?\"\nThat’s right. He’d learned some facts about the Magic Empire, the popular items, as well as monster and dungeon information separate from the Underground Empire.\nOf course, contrary to the Underground Empire, high level dungeons shouldn’t appear near places where people lived. He was sure that the Magic Empire was more expansive than the Underground Empire, so he assumed that monsters would exist up here that could increase his stats.\n\"So did you find one?\"\n\"There are a lot more than I expected.\"\nHe’d thought that dungeons wouldn’t exist near cities. However, when he actually looked into it, there was a level 5 dungeon 30 minutes away by foot.\n\"It seems like level 3 or 4 dungeons are the ones most welcomed, based on the dungeon items sold here and people’s perception. A single, renowned adventurer can clear a level 3 or 4 dungeon alone, and even if they can’t, they can form a party to conquer the dungeon. In other words, people who actually fight on the surface are level 4 or level 5 at best.\"\n\"It’s like the Underground Empire.\"\nBut at the level 5 mark, the danger ramps up exponentially. Normally, one would enter a dungeon one level lower than them, so an adventurer would have to form a party of level 6s to conquer a level 5 dungeon... But finding a level 6 human was in itself rare.\nWell, it made sense. To become level 6, one needed a total of 3,200 stats. From level 3 to level 4, it required 400 stats, and from level 4 to level 5, it required 800 stats. And from here, the amount of stats one needed increased exponentially. This was one of the reasons that one was only considered a true hero after they’d hit level 6 in the Underground Empire.\n\"That’s why people conquer the lower level dungeons (up to level 4), whereas the higher level dungeons (level 5 and up) are left untouched, with only their location and level of danger shared. However, monsters continue to multiply in those dungeons if left unchecked, so they will eventually come out. If they are considered dangerous at this stage, then an expeditionary force of knights will be sent to take care of it. The high level adventurers are also commissioned to help take care of the monsters.\"\n\"It’s different from the Underground Empire, huh. There’s an actual system in place...\"\n\"What’s with you?\"\n\"You don’t feel anything? The fact that there are others, besides us, who are doing their best to survive?\"\n\"Mm, I guess so.\"\nLee Shin Woo could understand how he was feeling. Compared to the enemies they’d fought in the Underground Empire, these humans were weaklings and would group up. They would sometimes fight due to their greed or work together, but they all did their best to live. He felt the spice of life from it, which affirmed that it had been a good idea to come up here.\n\"Anyway, I heard a huge expeditionary force of knights and adventurers was sent to deal with the level 5 dungeon near ’Kuroa’s Glory’, so we don’t need to worry about that one. There’s an unconquered level 6 dungeon 2 hours away, so let’s go there first...\"\nClang. Lee Shin Woo was interrupted by a sudden bell sound. There was a giant bell tower in the center of the city. Armed soldiers passed by them and said loudly.\n\"Citizens, take shelter! Monsters are attacking! It’s a dungeon countercurrent!\"\n\"Dungeon countercurrent...\"\n\"What’s that?\"\nDungeon countercurrent. It meant that, for some reason, the monsters within would come out of the dungeon. The most common reason was there was limited space within the dungeon. But there were times where the boss itself would come out and take command over the group.\n\"This is something that could never happen underground.\"\n\"Yeah. If they leave, they’d then be infected by the curse and die.\"\nOnce they realized just how different the underground and the surface were, Lee Shin Woo and Jin were in awe. But unfortunately, they couldn’t afford to be so relaxed right now. This dungeon, which was undergoing a countercurrent of monsters, should’ve been taken care of by the knights, but if the boss came out, then several level 6 adventurers would be needed to fight it off!\n\"Take shelter! Hurry!\"\n\"Those who can fight, bring your weapons and gather at the eastern gate! You’ll temporarily follow the adventurer guild leader’s commands!\"\n\"What about the lord? Did he say we could use the golems?\"\n\"The guardian golems are outside of the city. The policing golems are weak, so they can’t do anything!\"\n\"Damn... Find some reinforcements wherever you can!\"\nThe city was in chaos. It was being attacked when Lee Shin Woo was visiting, so was he lucky or unlucky? Lee Shin Woo was briefly lost, but soon made his decision.\n\"Alright. This is a good opportunity. This’ll be the main stage for the most powerful mercenary, Kay.\"\n\"Another alias!?\"\n\"I had this planned from the start. The powerful mercenary who supports Lawrence from the shadows...! Lawrence grows as a peddler, and at the same time, we emphasize Kay’s strength. They’ll become the most powerful combo in the Magic Empire. Though they’re both me!\"\nAt first, he’d planned on using Kay after he’d begun his wine auctioning. Kay would take care of anyone who tried to harm Lawrence, raising his reputation. However, a great opportunity had presented itself, so he could go wild!\nLee Shin Woo clenched his fists and discreetly activated his Disguise skill. Then, Jin, who’d class changed from a pack horse to a war horse, said a bit coldly.\n\"Shin Woo, I got it.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"This is what you mean by ’relaxing’, right?\"\nHe’d hit the mark, so Lee Shin Woo flinched. Lee Shin Woo quickly equipped his thick, red plate armor and tied a huge greatsword to his back (it was the evolved form of Metafel’s greatsword, the Lv7 Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatsword). He looked like a warrior that you’d see in comics.\n\"You’re not... having fun?\"\n\"Well, I knew this was going to happen, so whatever.\"\nJin shrugged his shoulders, then tilted his shoulders to make it easier to get on, and continued.\n\"Let’s think about it after killing them all.\"\n\"You got it. Let’s go!\"\nHere, in Kuroa’s Glory, marked the first act of the hero Kay!\n...Though his actions were no different from a demon king’s!",

    "content": "<Chapter 38. The Peddler and the Adventurer - 2>\n[A large group of monsters coming from the east has been confirmed.]\n[Without proper fortifications, the city will come to harm.]\nThe city was informed of the dungeon countercurrent through a report from the patrolling golem network, obtaining an approximation of the monsters’ identities and size beyond the dust cloud. Immediately after, the golems simultaneously repeated reports and warnings.\n[Recommend a mobilization order under Section 3, Article 2 of the City Defense Act.]\n[Warning. 19 golems patrolling the city’s perimeter have been destroyed. The monsters will crash into the eastern gate in less than 7 minutes. Please prepare sufficiently.]\nThe patrolling golems were programmed to attack any monsters that approached the city. They reported and simultaneously attacked the monsters, but they weren’t able to fend them off, as they were only level 4 while the monsters were level 5 or higher. They had only slowed down the monsters by about 3 seconds.\n\"Keuk, kihuok...!\"\n\"Hey, wait a second. Isn’t that a human?\"\n\"!? Stop. Let that guy in!\"\nAt the ring of the bell, the soldiers situated at the top of the walls closed the gate, too late to respond. But then, right when the gate was about to close, someone just barely rushed through.\nAll of the soldiers inside gripped their spears and prepared for any eventuality, but the man had fallen flat on his face.\n\"H-Healing...! Please heal me...!\"\nAlthough he had a huge hole in his stomach and his entire left arm had been ripped off, he’d somehow managed to stay alive. The soldiers looked on in awe, as he’d survived with such grievous wounds; only one soldier realized who he was.\n\"Hey, this is one of the adventurers that was dispatched with the knights! Were these wounds caused by those monsters... Hey, call a priest over here. Hurry up!\"\n\"Kuhuek...! It hurts. It really hurts!\"\nThe city was in an uproar. Due to the golems’ reports, children rushed into their homes and before they’d even gotten a good understanding of the situation, the merchants packed their things to take refuge. Despair was quickly spreading through the city.\n\"Keuk, Keuuuk...!\"\n\"...Report! , Adventurer. What happened over there?\"\nThe Guard Captain ran over, followed by a priest. The adventurer groaned in pain and couldn’t answer the Guard Captain’s question. But once he had undergone proper treatment, he explained what had happened whilst crying.\n\"T-There was a trap inside the dungeon...!\"\nIt was simple. The expedition had gone well until the boss room. But the moment they reached the boss room, a boss appeared, one so strong that it was unsuited for a level 5 dungeon.\n\"It was a high rank level 6... N-No. A level 7! It’s definitely level 7. The boss was definitely level 7!\"\n\"Level 7!? That’s a load of crap. Why would a disaster-class monster be here!?\"\n\"There’s no way a level 7 boss would appear inside of a level 5 dungeon! Wait a sec. If you were able to take care of the monsters before the boss room, then what’s with the number of monsters...?\"\n\"Those aren’t just normal monsters. They are all undead, including the boss!\"\n\"...What!?\"\nIt was bad enough that they faced a level 7 boss, but they also had to fight against the undead forms of the felled monsters, which resurrected upon the boss’s appearance. The dungeon had turned into hell.\nThe level 6 Knight Leader and the level 6 adventurers tried to find a way out, but all their attempts failed. In the end, they were all killed. The reason the adventurer had even survived was because he’d been injured prior, and stood on standby outside of the boss room.\n\"So you ran out once you saw the signs...\"\n\"Yes. I told you everything! We can’t beat that thing. I’m running!\"\n\"...The city’s in danger. If you’re going to run away from the front, even after being healed, then I’ll strike you down here and now.\"\n\"What...!\"\nThe adventurer’s report didn’t help them at all. Although they knew what was happening now, they didn’t know how to deal with the monsters or what the cause of it all was.\nThe monsters continued to get closer and closer, yet more and more people were giving up. The city had sent their best soldiers to the dungeon and those soldiers had all died, so there was nothing they could do.\n\"Did you report to my superiors?\"\n[It was sent after grasping the situation. Reinforcements are expected to arrive in 3 hours. Blocking the monsters’ advance by gathering all the city’s golems (intended for guarding, patrolling, and maintaining public order). They can delay the monsters for about 30 minutes.]\nThe golem network, which the current Emperor had created, was indeed impressive. While the humans panicked, the golems did everything in their power. Despite that, they lacked both time and manpower in this situation.\n\"I see. It’s time I pay back the Empire for its kindness, with my life.\"\nThe eastern Guard Captain (level 5, a 37 year old bachelor) silently muttered and gripped his greatsword. The other three guard captains grabbed their weapons and rushed over. They were well aware of the current situation, due to the golems’ reports, and looked ready to die.\n\"You won’t take one more step into this city until we die!\"\n\"Uooooooooh. In the name of the Loyal Shield, I’ll kill all of you dirty monsters!\"\n\"Captain, I’ll come with you!\"\n\"They’ll have to walk over my dead body to get through!\"\nThe sight of the Guard Captain practicing noblesse oblige moved the soldiers, dispelling the once stagnant atmosphere. They were 1,000 strong, excluding the golems! Their resolve to die was truly blinding.\n’Ah, what the hell. I finally came up to the surface, but there are undead up here too.’\nWhereas Lee Shin Woo, who couldn’t empathize with the soldiers, ascertained the situation and frowned. He’d come to the surface, yet he had to fight against a dungeon countercurrent of monsters, which were all undead. There’s only so much you can disappoint someone!\n\"Shin Woo, we’re almost at the gate.\"\n\"Ok, ok.\"\nThe city was in chaos, so no one cared that a huge warhorse was running across the road. No, they probably didn’t have the time to even care. The situation was great for Lee Shin Woo and Jin.\n\"Good, let’s go!\"\n\"Heup!\"\nJin sprinted forward and leapedleapt up before they hit the gate. The walls were only 5 meters high, so Jin didn’t even need to create the springs through Steel Heart. With just a battle cry and a light jump, they were able to pass over the wall.\n\"What!?\"\n\"No way...!\"\n\"They’re flying!\"\nThey flew over the soldiers, who were nervous from the approaching monsters, and landed safely onto the ground. The Guard Captain and his soldiers glared at them from atop the wall, but Lee Shin Woo didn’t worry about them. He just cool-headedly looked at the monsters.\n’6,000? No, there are about 7,000 of them... The boss is all the way in the back.’\nHe gripped his greatsword with one hand and checked the boss. Although it was all the way in the back, the four meter tall boss was overwhelming.\nThere were horns atop its goat head and it had the muscular body of a giant. It truly looked like a demon, but with it skin turning pale from the undead transformation, it looked even more sinister than before. It was...!\n[Lv6 Mad Goat Ghoul]\n\"What the hell.\"\nOnce he’d checked the boss’s name and level, Lee Shin Woo looked back with a sharp gaze. Although he was wearing a helmet, the soldiers felt his killing intent and stepped back while uttering ’hik’.\nHowever, the adventurer that had informed them of the boss wasn’t atop the walls. Well, he was a coward, so there was no way he’d have gauged the boss’s level properly!\n\"Shin Woo, calm down. We’ve been fighting so many strong opponents lately that I’d forgotten too, but level 7 elites aren’t supposed to be that common.\"\n\"It wouldn’t be so bad if I hadn’t had such expectations, but... Sseup, I guess it can’t be helped.\"\nA monster, which wasn’t supposed to be undead, had come out of the dungeon, and monsters that should already be dead had come back as undead. That was the current situation he was dealing with.\nHe didn’t know the specifics, but it probably had something to do with the curse, so Lee Shin Woo’s main priority had to be figuring out how the curse had spread to the surface.\n\"Then let’s play, just as we planned.\"\n\"It doesn’t seem any different from what we normally do, but... I’m going!\" Read complete versıon only at Novᴇl_Fire(.)net\nJin dashed forward without a signal! The approaching monsters saw them coming, and briefly flinched. However, these undead turned monsters would have no way of ascertaining Lee Shin Woo’s skill, so they immediately surrounded him...\n\"Umph!\"\nLee Shin Woo forcefully swung his greatsword, which unleashed a barrage of flames, and the monsters melted away. As befitting of an undead corps, without any knowledge of strategy or how to use the land to their advantage, they were grouped up in a single spot. His last attack had burned dozens of them to a crisp.\n[Kahaaaahk!?]\n[Kiiik!]\n\"Now for the second one!\"\nThe undead instinctively felt fear and shrank away from the blazing fire, but Lee Shin Woo took that opportunity to swing his greatsword again.\nIt looked crude, but nonetheless, his swordsmanship was incredible, as he quickly swung his greatsword at any enemy within range of it. It was only possible because he possessed Bursting Thunder, which would increase his skill in any weapon.\n[Critical Hit!]\n\"Ooh, let’s widen the range this time!\"\n\"Shin Woo, are you just going to keep burning them like this? You have Instigate, and you could use Bursting Thunder or Bone Armory...\"\n\"Jin.\"\nThe monsters realized how dangerous he was and ran away in fear. However, Lee Shin Woo spewed flames from his greatsword once more and quietly spoke.\n\"I’m the greatest mercenary, Kay, who uses a fire greatsword.\"\n\"Oh, I see...\"\nJin understood. Using Instigate to temporary bring the undead to his side or creating bone weapons to cut or explode his enemies was Paul Zero’s specialty, not Kay’s. However, using Bursting Thunder to burn a large numberquantity of enemies with his greatsword was.\nHe’d decided to use only his greatsword, so that no one would discover the connection between the two!\n’So he’s looking far into the further and acting accordingly... Yeah, I’ll just give up on understanding what he’s thinking, like I always do.’\nWhile Jin resigned himself like usual, Lee Shin Woo charged everywhere and burned the undead.\nWith one swing of his sword, he would burn 50 undead. It would only take 3 seconds to withdraw his sword and swing it again, so he could burn 1,000 undead in 1 minute!\nThough his calculations sounded like a joke, it was the reality, so there was nothing he could do about it. He faced the undead army head on and after only three minutes burned half of the original army!\n\"I will put my life at stake...\"\n\"To protect the Empire...\"\nThe Guard Captain, as well as his soldiers, had been ready to die for the Magic Empire, but seeing Lee Shin Woo tear through the monsters, they felt relieved, as well as a sense of discomfort that they couldn’t understand. However, there was no way Lee Shin Woo would know that. After all, these guys were weak, so they wouldn’t have been able to do much!\nOn the other hand, there were also soldiers within their ranks that were in awe of him.\n\"That guy’s a monster...\"\n\"He’s not a monster. He’s a hero! A hero has appeared!\"\n\"How can he burn so many undead...? Ha, now that I think about it!\"\nA soldier, who watched vacantly as Lee Shin Woo rampaged with his greatsword in hand, spoke of a rumor he’d heard just a little while ago.\n\"I heard that a central pillar of the Sun God Temple had collapsed. I heard that it was caused by the Sun God’s rage, but perhaps that wasn’t true...\"\n\"Perhaps it was a revelation that the Sun God was sending us a hero!\"\n\"Oooooooooh!\"\nLee Shin Woo wore red armor, wielded a greatsword tinged in flame, and swept away the undead, so it was only natural that they thought he was the Sun God’s hero.\nHe skillfully led his giant warhorse and bravely rushed into battle. And his greatsword continuously emitted such showy and destructive flames!\n\"A hero! The Sun God’s hero is protecting us!\"\n\"Oh Sun God!\"\n\"The Sun God’s hero!\"\nLee Shin Woo had no idea this was going on, but it seemed like the legend of the hero Kay had begun.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 38 part3",
    "content": "<Chapter 38. The Peddler and the Adventurer - 3>\nThe other humans or even the golems didn’t have a chance to intervene. Lee Shin Woo ran across the battlefield alone, spreading flames everywhere. His greatsword’s flames wouldn’t abate until its targets were burned to a crisp, and he, like the flames, continued to burn bright, regardless of the magic or stamina cost.\nBut that was only natural. No matter how much he looked like a human, he was undead. So he would never tire, and his magic...\n’Good. This ability’s the best when handling elemental power.’\nWhen Lee Shin Woo reached level 7, he became able to influence the ambient mana. It wasn’t the same as the level 8 Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin’s ability to dominate mana, but befitting his title of a Breathing Bone Joker, he could influence nearby mana whenever he expelled mana, as if breathing.\nAnd the longer he used that ability, the quicker he could influence the surrounding mana. By now, he could influence a huge area. In other words, it would take some time to power it up, but if given enough time, he could even take on a level 8. At least in terms of controlling mana.\n’And if the element itself becomes a medium, then that speed increases significantly.’\nHis mana-made flames infected the ambient mana, which in turn, created new flames. Of course, he could absorb those flames with his Absorption ability and revert them back into mana, but Lee Shin Woo wasn’t actually using up any mana right now.\nIt would be different if he were using an extra-large skill, but simply creating flames with the Fire element would barely leave a mark on his magic. On the contrary, he absorbed the flames that came back to him, ensuring that he had almost a full tank of magic. Although he’d caused this, it was almost scary even to him.\n\"It’s become a sea of flames.\"\n\"Jin, the boss is coming.\"\nHe’d fought for only 3 minutes, yet half of the monsters had been annihilated. There’s no way the boss wouldn’t notice that! The boss looked at Lee Shin Woo sharply and soon began to run towards him.\n[Baaaaaaaa!]\n\"Guuuuu, that thing’s making the same sound you make.\"\n\"Hey, isn’t that too harsh?\"\nThe Mad Goat Ghoul, surrounded in flames, took a single step and cried out, as if it had just stepped into hell, and then charged through!\nIts cry released a magic resembling death. It spread throughout the entire area, and simultaneously strengthened the undead and weakened the living. Unfortunately, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t living, so it hadn’t affected him at all!\n’The darkness of death is permeating the area. The Darkness element... Or is it only a fraction of it? Those who it shares its identity with, or in other words, those it’s connected to are strengthened while it simultaneously rebuffs those it’s not connected to; a very complicated buff skill. Though it’s probably using the skill without even knowing it’s using the Darkness element.’\nBut the problem was that the monsters which had transformed into the undead inherently possessed the Darkness element. If this were normal, then there should’ve been some sign of their transformation. Because the Mad Goat Ghoul possessed a skill powerful enough to affect the entire dungeon and change all the monsters into the undead, it had skipped all of the intermediate steps and went directly to the result.\n[Baaaaaaaa!]\n[Kihiiiiiiik!]\n[Kueeeeek!]\nThere was another problem: the Mad Goat Ghoul’s resurrection. While Ghouls ate humans too, their strength would increase the most when eating corpses!\nWhen the Mad Goat Ghoul realized how powerful Lee Shin Woo was, it ate any undead in its path, like Metafel Rerdan had done in the past, and its power continued to increase.\nIf he hadn’t intervened and the boss had invaded the city unimpeded, then the city would’ve fallen, as its death ability would spread, killing every living being inside. Perhaps it would harm other cities as well, eventually resulting in the birth of a level 7 elite undead.\n\"Weak.\"\nWell, that’s what would’ve happened had Lee Shin Woo not been here at least.\n[Baaaaaaaaaa!]\n\"You really are weak.\"\nThe Mad Goat Ghoul reminded him of Metafel Rerdan, as it did everything that he had once done. It led an army and then proceeded to eat said army. He looked at the Mad Goat Ghoul and clicked his tongue as if disappointed. He would’ve hated it less if it had evolved, but...\n\"You’re base stats are too low. Even if you ate everything here, you still wouldn’t reach level 7.\"\n\"When did you figure that out...?\"\n\"I didn’t know I could before, but I could somewhat tell after I checked its bone data and its mana level.\"\n\"Bone data...\"\nTo think he could use bones to thoroughly ascertain its abilities. What’s worse, it wasn’t even completely composed of bones like a skeleton, but a ghoul, which almost completely retained its previous body! Jin was fearful, as he wondered just how far Lee Shin Woo’s Rule of Bone skill would grow.\n[Baaa!]\n\"Hoo. Now then.\"\nIf he knew with absolute certainty that it would evolve to level 7, then he would wait patiently, but if it couldn’t, then there was no point in waiting any longer.\nLee Shin Woo looked straight at the approaching Mad Goat Ghoul and lightly raised his greatsword. He waited until the goat had gotten so close that Jin could even feel its breath and then...\n\"Heup!\"\nSwung his sword downwards!\n[Baaaaa!]\nOf course, the Mad Goat Ghoul was a dungeon boss and could use the Darkness element, albeit poorly. Despite the speed of his attack, the Mad Goat Ghoul responded quickly, forming a magic shield, casting a curse on him, and drawing the nearby undead corpses to in an attempt to defend itself.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo let it be, not because he didn’t know what it was doing, but because nothing would change even if it tried anything. So he just let it do its thing.\n[Ke... Keh...]\n\"Hoo.\"\nThe Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatsword burrowed deep into the ground and released flames as though it were coughing. Lee Shin Woo twisted the sword, softly removed it from the ground, and sighed.\nRight after, the Mad Goat Ghoul’s body was split in half and burned. All that remained was Perium and a single goat horn. The horn emitted a dense concentration of darkness, so a magician researching the Darkness element would find it valuable. But to Lee Shin Woo, who could already use High Rank Darkness, it was pointless.\n\"You want it?\"\n\"Nope.\"\nIt was pretty worthless to both Lee Shin Woo and Jin at this point, but he instinctively felt like he had to take it. Was it because he was Korean? He picked up the black goat horn, stashed it in his armor, and raised his head. All of the undead were looking at him.\n\"I thought it’d turn out this way. Beast-type undead lack brains.\"\nWhen the boss was killed, the undead temporarily stopped moving. Since the boss, which had a clear goal while commanding them was gone, they had lost all motivation to move.\nAll that was left of them were their undead instincts. The instinct to curse, but also yearn for the living! They foolishly gathered around him, like honeybees to a flower, without realizing that the fragrance of life he emitted was a ruse.\n\"The underground’s undead are better. They know how to recognize fear and run away.\"\nLee Shin Woo clicked his tongue and stabbed his greatsword back into the ground. At that moment, a huge amount of flames spewed out from the blade, covering the land. Hundreds of monsters were burned all at once, and then even more.\nAlthough it was powerful, it wasn’t a skill or magic. He just used his greatsword as a medium to create a high quantity of high rank flames. It was only possible because he already took control of the entire area’s mana.\n\"Wow, they’re like ants coming for a piece of candy.\"\n\"Ugh.\"\nWhat was even more surprising was that the undead continued to throw themselves into the flames. They had already lost all control, each and every one of them being drawn to his scent, and then they were burned.\nAfter that process continued for a while, no undead were left remaining. His expedition had ended in an instant.\n\"Ha.\"\nThen, Lee Shin Woo realized. The strongest mercenary, Kay. He had planned on using Kay as Lawrence’s trustworthy backer, and show such skill that no one in the city could ignore him, but... Things had gotten out of hand. Perhaps...\n\"Did I go overboard...?\"\n\"You think?\"\nJin sighed and replied. Then, he looked above the castle walls. The humans were still up there. As humans, they couldn’t see him, but Lee Shin Woo could see them. They looked at him as though he were a god.\n\"What are you going to do about that? At this rate, they’ll start worshipping you.\"\n\"Faith doesn’t come so easily. If it did, then pseudo religious leaders would be out of business. Well, it’s a lot different from my original plan, but this isn’t so bad. I gained quite a bit from acquiring the golems, so I suppose I can afford to make my plan a bit more aggressive than before.\"\nAfter showing such overwhelming dignity, there was no way he could just leave and say ’I’ll be going now’. Interested parties from the city, and even humans in high positions may come and find him. It might feel burdensome, but the amount of information and goods that he could obtain would increase immensely.\n’There is one thing that worries me. The Emperor of the Magic Empire, who Pleine told me not to approach under any circumstances.’\nHe decided that it wouldn’t be such a bad idea to meet with distinguished figures to obtain information on the Emperor. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.\n\"I can’t let it be. I need to be more active, if for no other reason than to figure out what that damn God is thinking. Well, if the worst case scenario does happen, then I can just sacrifice a life and run.\"\n\"It’s hard to use the Blessing of Death here, so let’s not.\"\n\"But death energy is scattered all around. Charge it up while you still can. ...Now then, I’m going to collect the loot now.\"\nLee Shin Woo used Rule of Bone discreetly so that the humans atop the castle walls wouldn’t notice, and drew all the Perium, as well as the bones towards him ASAP.\nHe collected the loot within 10 minutes, which was kind of funny considering the fact that it had taken longer than the battle.\n\"The Sun God’s hero!\"\n\"Ooh. Oh, hero!\"\nJin collected the death energy and Lee Shin Woo the loot. By the time they were done and grouped back up, the humans, having confirmed that it was safe, began to exit the gates one or two at a time. They gazed at Lee Shin Woo with bright eyes and shouted something, which was something Lee Shin Woo had heard before.\n\"The Sun God...?\"\n\"To think that the Sun God still loved the (Magic) Empire this much...\" [1]\n\"Let us thank the Sun God for sending us a hero!\"\n\"Sun God’s hero, please come this way! I would like to hear your name!\"\nThe guard captain of the eastern gate stood at the forefront and exclaimed. Lee Shin Woo had never heard of the ’Sun God’s hero’ before, but he was sure that they were referring to him!\nLee Shin Woo briefly thought about how he’d deal with this new title, but soon organized his thoughts, grinned and said.\n\"Good, so you know who I am! Indeed, I am the hero, Kay, that was sent by the Sun God to help you!\"\n\"Oooooooooooh!’\n’Hey!’\nHis current identity was already a pain in the ass to deal with, yet he still had the nerve to make such a lie! Jin cried out, but Lee Shin Woo didn’t let it worry him at all. If other people were to misunderstand and make up a great identity for him, then there was no point to straightening it out! For more chapters visıt novel⁂fire.net\n\"Oh, by the way. As per God’s command, I formed a contract with Lawrence, the peddler, so keep that in mind.\"\n\"The peddler, Lawrence!\"\n\"Ooh, so that extraordinary man was supported by the Sun God!\"\n\"All hail the Sun God!\"\nThe misunderstanding had spread, and no one could handle the situation. Lee Shin Woo felt how chaotic the situation had become and nodded his head in satisfaction. While Jin despaired and lowered his head, a message appeared before Lee Shin Woo like always.\n[The Acting skill has become Lv20. Perhaps you can fool even natural phenomena.]\nHis acting was so natural that if a Sun God did exist, they would say something like ’Ah, I really did send a hero!’. Lee Shin Woo grinned and stored his greatsword.\nPerhaps God would come to regret sending him to the surface, but it was already too late to take him back.\n[1] T/N: Both the undead and humans use the word empire, but for clarification purposes, I add in whether it’s the Magic Empire or the Underground Empire. Toy Car tends to use ’surface/underground’ to refer to the (Magic) Empire and the (Underground) Empire, but I often replace the former, as it’s incredibly awkward to use in an actual sentence.",

    "content": "<Chapter 38. The Peddler and the Adventurer - 4>\nTwo weeks had passed since the dungeon countercurrent. During that time, the peddler, Lawrence had cemented his position in Kuroa’s Glory because of the Sun God’s hero, Kay’s influence. Follow current novᴇls on N()velFire.net\nLee Shin Woo fearlessly advanced again and again, and was able to buy a villa once used by an aristocrat with good terms, became able to buy/sell various choice goods from the merchant’s guild, and was even authorized to open his own shop. These benefits were supposed to be unattainable by an unknown stranger, yet he had been given them. It made him wonder why he’d worked so hard, struggling with his Acting and Instigation skills thus far.\nHe couldn’t call himself a peddler anymore. After all, he was far off from a regular peddler now.\n\"They’re helping me so openly. ...They’re accepting me, even though they know I’m suspicious. That just tells you how much they want Kay’s power.\"\nLee Shin Woo showed off his goods on the display stand outside his store and muttered leisurely. It seemed like he’d just settle down in his shop, but he had bigger ambitions as a peddler.\nIn two weeks, he’d sell the wine in the auction, and after that, he would go to the next city... the capital and sell his goods there. He wasn’t going to take it slow and start from the outer cities as he’d done in the past. Even when he was relaxing, it would be the climax of the story.\n\"Aren’t they using you as bait to get to Kay? Since it’s better to keep someone in one place than letting them go around wherever they please.\"\n\"Jin... You’re a lot smarter than I expect... Hey, wait. I didn’t say anything. It was all my secretary!\"\nJin, who was tied outside his shop, asked a good question, but then bit off some of Lee Shin Woo’s hair and nibbled on it. Lee Shin Woo realized that having his hair, which was created by his Disguise skill, ripped off his head, was incredibly unpleasant.\nHowever, Jin was right. A powerful individual could become a blessing or a curse. The Emperor, or his followers, should’ve heard the report by now, so the reason they’d let him be for 2 weeks was likely to mobilize someone who could actually contend with Kay.\n\"I’m looking forward to their response. Will a level 7 pop up, or a level 8. Depending on who they send, I can estimate how strong the Magic Empire is.\"\n\"I don’t think they’ll send a level 8...\"\n\"Well, that’s not necessarily true.\"\nDuring these two weeks, Rem had been travelling across the cities and brainwashing the golems. Once its Mana Parasite had gained the Infection ability, its brainwashing speed increased, and the golems in several large cities were already under its control.\nThe information he gained from them increased significantly, and he was able to extract info regarding the Magic Empire’s main force...\n\"Listen, but don’t be surprised. You might’ve already guessed, but those bestowed with the title and power from the Emperor are known as the ’12 Generals’. Apparently, they’re not so different from the Underground Empire’s. That means level 8s may exist here too.\"\n\"...Heh?\"\nFor a moment, Jin didn’t know what Lee Shin Woo was talking about and looked on vacantly. The 12 generals? He’d thought that term was only used in the Underground Empire. However, the Magic Empire used the exact same term. That meant...\n\"Shin Woo, do the Magic (Surface) Empire and the Underground Empire share the same name?\"\n\"Ding ding.\"\nAs expected, Jin could be pretty smart when he wanted to be. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head in satisfaction and continued.\n\"The name of the Magic Empire is Heita. It’s exactly the same as the Underground Empire’s name.\"\n\"That’s... Wait a sec. Which one came first?\"\n\"That’s unusual. You’re quite sharp today. You go straight to the point.\"\n\"You know, it’s all because I’ve stuck around you for so long.\"\n\"I guess you’re right...\"\nWhich came first, the Magic Empire or the Underground Empire? The answer to that question was a lot more important than it might seem. When God had first summoned him, she had called it ’The Empire, Heita, which had flourished underground’. That meant there was a chance that humans born underground had created the Underground Empire.\n\"But unfortunately, humans originated from the surface. I wasn’t sure, so I used every means available to me, and found that humans were indeed born on the surface, not underground.\"\n\"Then... we can assume that the Empire was once whole, but was split due to some unknown circumstances. One side must’ve gone underground.\"\n\"Bingo. Exactly.\"\nIt was the shocking truth, but it didn’t really mean anything to him. The history wasn’t what mattered, it was what led history to go down that way, or the cause and effect.\n\"Think about it, Jin. No matter how wide the underground may be, do you really think that people would voluntarily live down there?\"\n\"Nope.\"\n\"Although the Empire flourished underground, do you really think they could live as naturally as those on the surface?\"\n\"...No.\"\n\"Exactly. There’s no way they’d be able to. So, let’s modify what you said. The Empire, which was once whole, split into two for some unknown reason, and one side was ’forced to live underground’.\"\n\"...\"\nThe two heroes daringly and extremely naturally figured out the truth. Once he came to the surface, he knew he’d figure out the truth eventually, but he couldn’t do anything about the bitter taste.\nTo think that the Underground Empire that they had to defeat had such a ridiculous truth behind it. What’s worse, their jobs didn’t change, despite knowing the truth, and they couldn’t do anything for the undead. They had no other choice but to exterminate the undead, just as they’d been doing.\n\"But that means we can’t trust anything God said to us...\"\n\"What about? The Underground Empire’s curse? You don’t think the humans on the surface created that, do you!?\"\nJin’s blank eye sockets blazed with fury. Unlike Lee Shin Woo, Jin possessed a sense of justice, so he wouldn’t be able to let this go. Even so, they couldn’t change what they were doing, so... Perhaps it would just fester in his heart.\n\"No, that’s not it. The Underground Empire’s undead... When you take a look at the attitudes of the 12 generals, who maintained their intellect, then no. But the Emperor used magic to achieve immortality... and it failed. There’s something else to it, something hidden.\"\nHonestly, Lee Shin Woo had a hunch before he’d come up here regarding what that truth may be, but once he actually came to the surface, he became even more sure of his assumption.\nBut because it was only a hypothesis without any evidence backing it up, he couldn’t just say it outright. If his hypothesis is true, then... he would have to sock God in the face before he felt any better.\n\"So, we have to more thoroughly investigate the surface, if for no other reason than to find out the truth. That’s what I’m leaving to Rem.\"\nAt the same time, Lee Shin Woo acted as Lawrence, the peddler, and the hero Kay, gaining what he could from the surface. And what he wanted probably lay in the capital.\n\"Shin Woo. You’re planning on meeting the Emperor, aren’t you?\"\n\"I don’t have to meet him, but if need be. It might turn out that way in the end.\"\n\"I knew this would happen.\"\nHe remembered Pleine’s warning. She didn’t say it outright, but he’d guessed how powerful the Emperor was based on her attitude.\nHe was probably level 9. If not, then Pleine wouldn’t have warned him like that. Since Lee Shin Woo could take on a level 8 now. Even if he fought against Feotane Von Seldin, he could come out of it alive.\n’But I can’t avoid him just because he’s dangerous.’\nPleine had misunderstood something. Although he had to oppose all the undead, he didn’t need to do that for the surface dwellers. He didn’t need to avoid him like the plague just because his level was high.\nCould the Emperor even see through his Disguise and Acting skills? He was joking of course, but Lee Shin Woo thought he’d be able to somewhat trick God at this point. No matter how high their level was, so long as they were a human, they won’t be able to see through Lee Shin Woo’s facade.\n\"You know, it might be fun to become one of the 12 generals in the meantime...\"\n\"Let’s not...\"\n\"Yeah, I was just joking. Even I’m not confident enough to work under him and keep acting.\"\nRight after he spoke, he felt someone coming towards his shop. When he looked over, he saw a heavily armed female knight. It was kind of funny seeing her being so tense around a peddler.\n\"D-Does the Sun God’s hero, Kay live here?\"\n\"He doesn’t, but he lives in a place where I can contact him.\"\n\"Then please relay this message to Sir Kay! The pope of the Sun God religion requests an audience! He came to the lord’s castle without any prior notice, so you have no idea how surprised we... Eup.\"\n\"...Oh?\"\nHe thought it’d be better if he seemed more distinguished, so he’d called himself the Sun God’s hero. To think it’d turn out like this. However... the Sun God religion. It wasn’t so bad when he thought about it. No, it was actually great.\nLee Shin Woo didn’t know how prosperous the Sun God religion was, but considering how the female knight was acting, they were definitely an organization that the Magic Empire couldn’t deal with so easily. If that’s the case, then he would be able to meet with the Emperor assuming a more favorable position.\nHe immediately formulated several plans in his head, and continuously broke up and reassembled pieces of his plan. As a result...\n\"I understand. I’ll tell him right away.\"\n\"Mm, thank you. We can prepare a carriage for you...\"\n\"No, he’ll probably arrive there on his own.\"\n\"Mm, that would be disrespectful to the Sun God’s hero... However, if that’s what he wants, then I guess we have no choice. I understand. I’ll let them know. Then I’ll get going now...\"\n\"Yes. Come back again!\"\nThe female knight sighed in relief and left. Lee Shin Woo thought he needed an assistant ASAP and cleaned the store. He couldn’t get there on a horse, so he would have to leave Jin here.\n’See you.’\n’Ok.’\nHe first disguised himself as Kay where no one was looking. Then, he tied the greatsword on his back and walk over to the lord’s castle. Lee Shin Woo looked incredibly dignified, and everyone he passed on the road took notice of him. Moreover, fire wrapped around his surroundings, so there was no one who didn’t know who he was.\nHe encountered various people along the way. Some spoke of the ’Sun God’s hero’ from behind him, while others approached him and said it to his face. There were even some who were afraid of being harmed and just stepped back. Of course, this would enhance the influence of the Sun God’s hero, Kay, and at the same time, ensure that Lawrence, the peddler, would remain safe.\n[Lv7 Pope of the Sun God religion - Aurel Genisman]\n30 minutes later, Lee Shin Woo met the Pope of the Sun God religion in the castle’s living room. From first glance, he looked like a middle-aged man, but his level was higher than he’d expected. He wasn’t just a representative of the religion.\n\"You moved quite boisterously. So much so that I question how you were able to hide your identity until now.\"\n\"I can’t?\"\n\"No. It’s fine since the Emperor’s no doubt aware that we’ve come here. No... actually, that ostentatious attitude of yours might fit with our goal. You may just be acting conspicuous, but that’s even more in our favor.\"\n\"...Hoh.\"\nLee Shin Woo understood what he was saying and smiled. He thought the pope would say something like ’You’re the hero the Sun God has chosen!? I can’t believe it!’ and test him first, but was instead showing his hand.\nIn layman’s terms, this was the Pope’s intent. ’It doesn’t matter if you’re really the Sun God’s hero or not. Why don’t you work with us?’.\n\"I’d like to hear about it in more detail.\"\nHonestly, Lee Shin Woo didn’t hate these kinds of people. If their goals aligned, they would have a good relationship.\n\"I’m glad you understand, Sun God’s hero.\"\nThe Pope grinned and said.\nUnfortunately for the people on the surface, Lee Shin Woo and the Pope really hit it off.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 38 part5",
    "content": "<Chapter 38. The Peddler and the Adventurer - 5>\nAccording to the Pope of the Sun God religion, several religions existed on the surface. These religions each served a different god, and the most powerful of these religions was the Magic God religion, while the Sun God religion had declined the most.\nThere were also the subordinate gods who followed them. They flourished in some areas, so it was difficult to know about all of them.\n\"Several gods...\"\nLee Shin Woo tilted his head as he listened to the Pope. If there were so many of them, then who had sent the heroes to the Underground Empire, and what were these other gods doing, despite the world being on the brink of destruction?\n\"You should stop there.\"\nBut before Lee Shin Woo voiced his concerns, the Pope spoke firmly and stopped him.\n\"Going any further is forbidden. You cannot question the reason for the gods’ existences.\"\n\"I suppose it’s not important right now. It’s that the influence of the Sun God religion has waned, is it not?\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nThe Pope nodded his head solemnly and added.\n\"It’s embarrassing, but we don’t have enough people. The daylight, which occupies half the day, the radiance that fosters the growth of all creation, and the fire that accompanied the birth of civilization. We lack followers, even when our God reigns over all this...\"\n\"I see. I was born in the countryside, so I’m not really knowledgeable on the subject.\"\n\"...What’s worse, our own followers are no exception. The remains of the Sun God Temple is essentially a symbol of our religion. Although the central pillar was stolen, we couldn’t find the perpetrator. Does that make any sense?\"\nThat was strange. He felt like he’d heard about this before. Lee Shin Woo did his very best to reply as relaxed as he could, so that his anxiety wouldn’t show.\n\"Your security must’ve been lax.\"\n\"Though a part of it may be that the perpetrator was skilled, even so, our paladins were guarding the ruins, so no one should’ve been able to get through. We thought it may be a revelation from the Sun God, but... anyone with a brain could tell you it wasn’t. It was truly humiliating.\"\n\"...You went through a lot.\"\nWhile comforting the Pope, Lee Shin Woo was inwardly cursing. To think that Lee Shin Woo had paid Pleine 350 million Perium for stolen goods! The Pope, who couldn’t come to know that the pillar had become a part of the Titan Golem, sighed deeply and continued.\n\"We’ll slowly decline and eventually be left as part of history. That’s what we expected to happen to us. I thought that perhaps I would be the final pope. However, that’s when you showed up.\"\n\"It was perfect timing. The Sun God hasn’t abandoned you all.\"\n\"Haha, it does seem that way. The Sun God has given us one last chance.\"\nAt this point, the two’s eyes glimmered unusually. Now, they would get to the main point.\n\"I told you already, but our power has diminished significantly. But the fame and authority we’ve accrued over hundreds of years hasn’t. If you’re truly as skilled as you say, then we can give you wings. Will you help us revive our order?\"\n\"You said it yourself, that your order has declined. I think it’s too much to hope for one man to resurrect your order.\"\n\"But keep this in mind. The moment people see you, they’ll consider you the Sun God’s hero. It’s both authority and recognition. We can rise up again if we’re given the chance. More firmly, and more radiantly than ever before.\"\nThen, the Pope added.\n\"You accepted the title of the Sun God’s hero. Obviously, the Emperor doesn’t appoint people of the religious order. If you want to ’go far’, then there’s no other way than to align with us.\"\n\"I’m confident that I can do it on my own. Hmm... But I suppose there’s no reason to reject your offer.\"\nAt that time, Lee Shin Woo paused and acted like he was thinking deeply about it. However, he never intended to reject the Pope’s offer. Since there was no better support in cementing his position than a religious order.\nHe wondered how much they could support him, but he would be able to find that out slowly, starting now.\n\"Alright. First off, please tell me more about the Sun God religion, as well as how you’d like to use me. In detail.\"\n\"Ok, we’ll do it your way. It’ll definitely be a ’trade’ that’s worthwhile for the both of us.\"\nThe Pope gave a presentation for the next 30 minutes or so. As he’d thought, the Pope had a progressive way of thinking and at the same time, looked at his religious order like a business. He was a good fit for Lee Shin Woo, as he didn’t believe in the Sun God.\n\"So, unconquered dungeons.\"\nAbove all, the ’method’ he suggested was something that Lee Shin Woo approved of.\n\"Exactly. In this flourishing Empire, there’s only one thing that concerns the public: the unconquered dungeons. If our order actively conquers these dungeons, then your name, and by extension, ours, will became more widespread.\" ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ novelFirｅ.net\n\"Indeed.\"\nHe was right, as the matter with the dungeon countercurrent would indicate. Kuroa’s Glory, which was protected by the golems and possessed plentiful food and a variety of industries... was an attractive commercial city, yet had been put in danger from a mere level 5 dungeon countercurrent. The reason Kay had become so popular and was called the Sun God’s hero was because he had taken care of the dungeon countercurrent in such a short period of time.\nMoreover, conquering dungeons aligned with Lee Shin Woo’s quest of gaining high level bones and becoming stronger. Rem had found a few dungeons as well, but he couldn’t be satisfied with just a handful of dungeons.\n\"There are dungeons nearby that have been neglected because no one lives near them, or dungeons that have been ignored because the people around them are all dead... Those dungeons are managed by periodically suppressing the monsters that come flooding out of them. But if all of the monsters come out with the boss, like in this instance, then there’s a chance that an entire city will fall.\"\n\"Then why are they left alone?\"\n\"Because we lack time, money, and people!\"\nHe said ardently. They were lacking in everything!\n\"The biggest problem amongst them is people. Level 6s don’t grow on trees. The Emperor’s knights and magicians, as well as each religion’s paladins and priests have their hands full doing their jobs. Plus, they could die in the dungeon. Whenever the matter is brought up, the higher ups probably reject it.\"\nLee Shin Woo gazed at the Pope with an expression that said ’Then what about me?’, and the Pope replied calmly.\n\"We don’t have the luxury of playing fair. We’ve already picked a few of our paladins and priests to assist you in your dungeon conquests. That’s their priority right now. They’ve even written their last wills and testaments.\"\nHuman rights were being violated in the name of religion! Lee Shin Woo looked at the Pope condemningly and asked.\n\"You seem strong yourself, so why don’t you go?\"\n\"I’ve concealed my identity and have my hands full already. Just because I’m a pope doesn’t mean I can just sit back on the balcony and drink wine all day.\"\nConsidering how the Pope kept talking and talking about the situation, he must really want to sit back on the balcony and drink wine. How did this religious order decline so much? Lee Shin Woo felt slightly bitter.\n\"Anyway, keep listening. Your name won’t become more renowned by blindly conquering dungeons. That’s where we come in. We advertise your abilities on a large scale, publicizing what dungeons you’ve conquered and how you did it. In addition, we emphasize the strength of our paladins and our priests, drawing people’s interest. We can’t lie, but it’s not that hard to exaggerate things. If results follow, then this contract will definitely succeed.\"\n\"Haha. It’s quite the aggressive plan.\"\n\"This is our struggle. Will it just end in our struggle, or will it turn into a great success? That all depends on you.\"\nThe Sun God religion had gone from a commercial business to an entertainment business! But if it all went according to the Pope’s plan, then Lee Shin Woo’s position in the Magic Empire would strengthen. As he thought, this Pope meant business.\n’They’re not only giving me info on the unconquered dungeons, but support as well. I suppose I can’t say that the golems possess all the information in the Empire. Alright. These are conditions too good to say no to.’\nThe plan was of the ’high risk, high return’ variety. However, Lee Shin Woo had looked forward to fighting strong opponents over everything else once he came to the surface, so he could say that there was ’no risk’. But there was no reason to tell the Pope this, so Lee Shin Woo continued while acting calmly.\n\"Repeatedly attacking unconquered dungeons, dungeons that are so dangerous that no one has laid a finger on them... Ultimately, the plan relies entirely on me subjecting myself to incredible danger. Besides the fame, is there anything else that I get out of this?\"\n\"The loot is all yours. I’d like some of the Perium, but you can have it all if you don’t want to give us any.\"\n\"I’ll divide the Perium amongst my team members. I’ll take all the loot, but I’ll give you equivalent Perium in return.\"\n\"I appreciate it. Hmm, aside from that, there’s authority. I’ll give you the position that is under or equal to the Pope, the position of ’Saint’. This title is only conferred when someone of extraordinary strength appears. Of course, I’d be ok with giving you the title of Pope, but...\"\n\"No thank you. I can’t even sit on a balcony and drink wine all day.\"\n\"I knew you’d say that.\"\nThe Pope’s voice became a bit quieter.\n\"...Oh, I heard that Lawrence, the peddler, is hosting an auction. Wine, right? I wonder how great the wine could be. I’m not really asking for any. I just wanted to see how valuable the auctioned product would be in advance. I really don’t want to drink it, but it’d be troublesome if we stake our reputation on a business selling a strange product.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s expression became tepid. Is that so? This person was like Pleine, huh. So this was why he had been so amiable... But since he was the Pope of the Sun God religion, he was a valuable customer! He couldn’t let his opportunity go.\n\"To be honest, I have a bottle on me from Lawrence.\"\n\"Oooooh!\"\n\"You’ll become the shop’s sponsor, so I’ll sell it to you at a special price.\"\n\"Ooooh! ...Oh?\"\nThe Pope froze when he said ’special price’. Lee Shin Woo took out a bottle of Kerr Century Elemental 451 and popped the cap off. He placed the bottle under the Pope’s nose and the Pope shook. It seemed like he really liked it.\n\"I’ll buy it! At your special price!\"\n\"It’s 77,000 Perium, Customer.\"\n\"...Here.\"\n\"Thank you very much, Customer. Ah, there’s a balcony over there.\"\nThe Pope was finally able to drink wine on a balcony. After he drank the entire bottle, he decided to wholeheartedly support Lawrence’s shop.",

    "content": "<Chapter 39. New Party Member - 1>\n\"1,500 bottles of Kerr Century label red wine? How’s that even possible? After the last mass release, there were only a few dozen bottles found across the Empire.\"\nNews of the auction spread quickly. Lee Shin Woo would’ve considered it a success if news of the auction had spread to the hundreds of thousands of people in Kuroa’s Glory, but he had miscalculated.\nWas it due to the Sun God religion’s help? In just two days, the lord and all the nobles had become aware of the auction, and by the fourth day, news of the auction had spread to the nearby cities.\n\"But the master sommeliers already took a look at them. Moreover, the Sun God religion is backing it, so there’s no way they’d lie.\"\n\"The Sun God religion is really particular about their wine due to the pope. If they’re willing to sponsor this auction, then... Wait a sec. They’re transporting 1,500 bottles of wine and are backed by the Sun God religion. Who exactly are they?\"\n\"Lawrence. I’ve never heard of him before, but it seems like he’s quite skilled.\"\n\"Hmm. He’s probably being manipulated by the Sun God religion, rather than being skilled. If the auction goes well for them, then the other religions will feel uneasy.\"\nKerr Century Wine had a lot more influence on the surface than Lee Shin Woo had expected. Rumors had spread far and wide across the Magic Empire through the use of nimble-footed merchants and a communication line. At the same time, people quickly became aware of Lawrence, the Sun God religion, and the hero Kay as well.\n\"Don’t be surprised by what I say next. I hear that the Kerr Century that they’re selling... was created after the fall of the Underground Empire.\"\n\"Wait, that means...\"\n\"It means the Sun God religion has procured a Kerr Century Winery! But how?\"\nIn the official announcement, Lawrence had procured the Kerr Century Winery’s facilities and techniques, but the rumors were misrepresenting the facts.\nThey thought that, perhaps, the Sun God religion had access to the Underground Empire and that the Underground Empire may not have fallen. Most snorted at these rumors, but there were some who actually took the news to heart.\nIt was nothing more than suspicion without a shred of evidence, but because of this distortion of the facts, it practically guaranteed that the rumors would spread even further, causing the high ranking officials to take action. Not only that, but the other religions became curious... Ultimately, the size of the auction, as well as the participants had swelled to an enormous size.\n\"I did want the high ranking officials to take notice of me, but if this goes on, playing a dual role may become impossible for me.\"\n’Can’t you just leave it to the merchants you signed a contract with? You planned on using them as your proxy from the start.’\nLee Shin Woo anguished, but then, he heard Jin’s voice through the Assimilation skill. Though he was tied outside of his lodgings, his voice could still be relayed through the Assimilation skill.\n\"A proxy, huh... They’re too weak.\"\nLee Shin Woo pondered seriously. Of course, Lawrence could easily pull back for safety reasons and use the merchants as his proxy, but he wasn’t sure whether he could find people he could trust enough to talk in his place.\n’How about asking the Sun God religion?’\n\"I can’t let them take over anymore. No matter what others think, we have to take the reins. So...\"\nLee Shin Woo briefly thought about it and soon made a decision. He’d already considered this before. It would be such a waste to not use the Heaven Door’s Key. Couldn’t he just bring a trustworthy human to the surface?\n’A human you can trust... Kratia?’\n\"Kratia would be really happy, but she’s in the middle of special training with Prince, so she can’t leave. I’d rather not bother her right now.\"\nAlthough they were acting separately now, he contacted her once every week. He had left the Huginn’s Eye to her, and she was simultaneously studying magic and the artifact.\n’Ah, that’s right. Then who? ...You’re not going to ask Retadane, are you?’\n\"Why would she even come up? You never know when she’ll blow.\"\n’It looked like you guys really got along.’\nWhy was this happening? For the past few days Jin seemed to be in a good mood, yet his voice was turning melancholy again. Did he hate Retadane or something? Lee Shin Woo tilted his head and refuted him.\n\"No way. There are only two choices for her. I either reform her and use her as an ally, or I take her out before something goes wrong. The whole reason I even talked to her was because of that decision.\"\n’Really...?’\n\"Yeah, so don’t worry about her too much. I’m not sure how I’m supposed to get closer to that psychopath though...\"\n’Then it’s fine.’\nJin replied as though a burden had been lifted. It seemed like he’d misunderstood, thinking that Lee Shin Woo actually trusted Retadane. Lee Shin Woo felt relieved, and Jin took that time to ask another question.\n’Wait a sec. So who are you going to pick then? You wouldn’t pick Lloyd.’\n\"There’s only one person that’ll work. Ye Jin Jin.\"\n’Ah, that’s right. Jin Jin. Yeah, she’d be fine.’\nJin must’ve completely forgotten about her, but Lee Shin Woo acted like he didn’t notice.\n\"It’s easy to deal with Ye Jin Jin. She trusts anything I say, and she knows about our identities, so we don’t need to hide anything from her.\"\n’Remember. You shouldn’t say that a woman is ’easy to deal with’. Don’t treat her pure love and faith in you as a tool.’\n\"M-My bad.\"\nLee Shin Woo politely apologized in response to Jin’s sound rebuttal and requested a private chat with Ye Jin Jin. If she wasn’t fighting or sleeping, then she would immediately...\n[Ye Jin Jin: Yes, Mr. Shin Woo!?]\n\"Fast...\"\n[Ye Jin Jin: Your voice is still so cool!]\nYeah, that’s why he didn’t want to contact her first. She’d definitely met him when he was a skeleton, so he couldn’t understand why she liked him more and more. Maybe she was romanticizing Lee Shin Woo in her imagination more and more, so her feelings had grown. Well, that’s what he assumed at least.\nHer feelings were so clear that even Lee Shin Woo, who was no expert in relationships, could tell how she felt about him. However, those feelings were incredibly burdensome to him, as he felt no sexual desire. A part of him was uneasy at the thought of meeting her, and the other part hoped she would snap out of it when they actually met again.\n\"There’s something I wanted to ask you...\"\n[Ye Jin Jin: Something you’d like to ask me? What is it!? Whatever it is, I’ll do it!]\n\"...Mm, yeah. Thanks.\"\nHow taxing! As he thought, his best bet would be for them to meet so her feelings for him would abate. Lee Shin Woo hated himself for not doing this sooner and told her about his plans.\nYe Jin Jin was obviously excited at the prospect of meeting face-to-face, and marked her coordinates for Lee Shin Woo. Fortunately, he recalled passing her location, so he felt like he’d be able to get there quickly with the Heaven Door’s Key.\n[Ye Jin Jin: I can’t leave here for the time being, so please take your time. Ah, it’s the level 2 danger zone, but you have to be careful on your way here.]\nFollowing the heroes’ battle with the 12 generals, it seemed as though the undead had become more violent; if she couldn’t find a dungeon, then it would be difficult for her to hunt monsters, so she was hiding for the time being. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head, promised he’d come and find her right away, and ended the chat.\n\"Hoo.\"\nImmediately after, a sigh naturally came out. Of course, he didn’t have lungs, so no breath actually came out.\n\"What do I do? I don’t want to meet her...\"\n’She’d cry if she heard you say that.’\n\"But I guess I have to go anyway... I’ll leave behind a simple message here for now.\"\nThey were currently living in a house they’d bought within Kuroa’s Glory. A week after he’d signed the contract with the Pope, they finished their first expedition.\nThe conquered dungeon was simple. It consisted of mostly level 5s, with level 6 elites occasionally popping up, but the dungeon had a bad reputation, as there were several monsters that could use poison or acid type status ailments strong enough to even kill level 7 knights or magicians.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo was covered in flames, and those flames burned away the acid and poison. He charged through the dungeon like a bulldozer and pushed his way through from the start to the finish (the boss room). All the paladins and priests did was pick up the loot. Rather than feeling dispirited, they responded with ’He truly is the one bestowed with the Sun God’s power!’ and looked at him with sparkling eyes.\n\"At latest, I should take a day, but they may come to find me before then. It should be fine if I just write that I went out with Lawrence for a bit.\"\n’They might misunderstand if you write that.’\n\"Huh...?\"\nJin didn’t explain any further, so Lee Shin Woo didn’t change his message and stuck it to the front door. Because at least 90% of the language used on the surface and underground were the same, he could write without difficulty (due to God’s help).\n\"Then, I’ll be back, Jin.\"\n\"You’re going without me?\"\n\"Yeah. I’m pretty fast now too. I was going to bring a couple of other guys with me along the way. It might be boring, but just wait patiently for me.\"\n\"Hey, if you’re going to do that, then at least let me out of the city.\"\n\"I suppose there’s no danger out there since you’re a veteran level 7. Alright, let’s go.\"\nLevel 6 bones didn’t really have any effect on Lee Shin Woo, since his stats had surpassed 10,000, but for Jin, whose agility had developed much more than his other stats, they would still have an effect on his Strength, Health, or Magic.\nSo Lee Shin Woo had given him most of the bones that he’d acquired on the surface, and as a result, Jin had gotten to 8,000 total stats.\n\"Don’t be late. And make sure you don’t encounter another one of the 12 generals and kill them.\"\n\"It depends on which of the 12 generals it is, but I got it.\"\n\"You lie all the time, so why are you only honest when it doesn’t matter?\"\n\"Then, see you tomorrow!\"\nAfter Lee Shin Woo had left Jin to ’graze’ outside the city (if Jin knew how he’d described it, then it wouldn’t end with him just giving him another ’rodeo’), he took a deep breath and activated the Heaven Door’s Key.\nContrary to when it was the Bone Gate, the Heaven Door’s Key used both bones and mana to activate. Ironically, a single activation lessened the strain immensely. Moreover, he’d acquired a ton of bones that he couldn’t use on the surface, so he would be able to activate it as much as he wanted.\n[You have become more familiar with the Heaven Door’s Key. Five people can now accompany you.]\n’Nice. We’re going underground.’\nThe light flashed and then Lee Shin Woo arrived at his designated coordinates. He’d arrived in the level 2 danger zone and with his speed, he could group up with Ye Jin Jin in just 3 minutes!\nOnce he’d gotten out of the tunnel of light, he quickly looked around and looked for anything that might be dangerous. Then, he nodded his head in satisfaction and moved his feet. Read full story at Novᴇl_Fire(.)net\n’As expected, the more I use the Heaven Door’s Key, the less its functions are limited. Five people can accompany me, excluding myself, so six people can go through it now. It went up by two all of a sudden.’\nHonestly, he didn’t need it that many. He wondered whether he should’ve brought Jin along or not, but it was already water under the bridge, so there was nothing he could do about it. ’For the time being, let’s keep this a secret from Jin,’ Lee Shin Woo inwardly muttered and quickened his pace. He soon arrived at the entrance to a hidden cave.\n\"Ye Jin Jin, are you there?\"\n\"Yes, Mr. Shin Woo...!?\"\nWas she waiting for him? When he called for her, she appeared right away. Her equipment had changed since they’d last met and she assumed a pose befitting a veteran hero, but she still gave off the impression of a junior hero, perhaps because she was a girl. Her impression didn’t change, but...\n\"Y-You look cool.\"\n\"Ah.\"\nLee Shin Woo then realized that he was still disguised in his human form.\nIf he wanted to get her out of her shell, then he’d have to work a little harder from now on.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 39 part2",
    "content": "<Chapter 39. New Party Member - 2>\nYe Jin Jin was already aware of Lee Shin Woo’s ability to disguise himself as a human being. He’d explained it to her after fooling Prince. That’s why he expected her not to raise a commotion at him appearing as a human. At least, that’s what he thought, but...\n\"You look exactly as I imagined, Mr. Shin Woo! You look so cool!\"\n\"You can imagine what I’d looked like with just my build?\"\n\"Yes!\"\n\"Ah, is that so...\"\nYe Jin Jin declared without even a shred of uncertainty, which caused Lee Shin Woo to go from speechlessness to admiration! Even now, she was carefully touching his forearm, cheek or hair, acting as excited and loud as other girls her age.\nAlthough it’d be easier for him if she followed him unconditionally, it would be a pain in the ass if she clung onto him too much. He tried to cool things down by returning to his original skeleton form, but...\n\"Kyaa, this form is cool in its own way! So when you become level 7, the atmosphere... Uuaah.\"\n\"Fine. I give up.\"\nOn the contrary, she blushed and looked muddled. That’s right, this girl was a necrophiliac! At that moment, Lee Shin Woo changed her danger level to 2. 1 was obviously reserved for Seira Von Retadane.\n’Is it because I left her alone all this time? She’ll likely cool off after traveling with me.’\nAfter all, their first meeting was both dramatic and fleeting. She was the type to fixate on her first impressions and even improve upon them, so if, conversely, he acted together with her, then her once strong impression of him will disappear. He concluded that, at the very least, it would weaken.\n\"But Mr. Shin Woo, could I really be of help to you? I worked really hard, but I wasn’t able to reach level 6... I’m still really weak.\"\n\"No, that’s fine. You worked really hard.\"\nHer current stats were slightly less than 3,100. Since level 6 required 3,200 total stats, she only needed about 100 or so stats to level up.\nHonestly speaking, Lee Shin Woo was shocked at how fast she’d grown. He and Jin possessed a specialized ability that allowed them to progress quickly, but Ye Jin Jin had nothing of the sort!\n\"I wanted to help you...! So I did whatever I could and worked hard!\"\n\"G-Good for you.\"\nSo this was the power of love, huh. He looked at Ye Jin Jin, who grasped her hands in front of her and almost lost his nerve.\nShe was the type who ignored everything around her. She wasn’t two-faced; she was honest and wore her heart on her sleeve. To think she’d worked so hard and grown so much just to be of help to him. If someone told him that she came out of a romance cartoon, then he’d believe it. Her face was pretty too, so had her partner not been a skeleton, it would’ve been perfect.\n’Even Lloyd, who’s pretty much the full package, has some darkness within him...’\nLee Shin Woo might’ve turned out differently had there been a young lady like Ye Jin Jin around in the past. Of course, it was nothing more than speculation, so it was pointless to think about. Plus, he liked how he turned out, so it didn’t matter.\n\"The job I have for you doesn’t really require strength. But it does require trust. It has to be someone who trusts me, and someone I can trust. You have to keep this a secret, too.\" New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on novｅlfire.net\n\"I can do that!\"\n\"I know. That’s why I called you.\"\nFirst off, Lee Shin Woo briefly explained the current situation he was in. She was surprised at the fact that Lee Shin Woo could go to the surface, as well as the fact that he could bring her with him.\n\"It’d be nice... if I could go too...\"\n\"You should be able to. The issue’s not about getting there. It’s about what you do after you get there.\"\nHe explained what the peddler, Lawrence, and the mercenary, Kay did in detail. She looked really happy to be Lawrence’s representative, but she was even happier at the fact that Kay was called the Sun God’s hero on the surface.\n\"It seems like the Sun God religion has a discerning eye!\"\n\"So I’ll be really busy for the time being. During that time, I’d like you to be Lawrence’s representative. Of course, I’ll pay you a corresponding amount of Perium... no, I’ll pay you even more.\"\n\"Perium...?\"\n\"Yeah. There’s a price for everything. The more burdensome it is, the more you have to pay in exchange.\"\nIn exchange for her being Lawrence’s representative, he would pay her Perium. He’d planned this ever since he first considered Ye Jin Jin a candidate.\nHe wasn’t really comfortable giving away karma, but Lee Shin Woo had realized that he’d be freer this way!\n\"I shouldn’t be the one saying this, but with the hero, Kay and the Sun God religion’s help, the value of the Lawrence shop will increase instantaneously. And if you’re the representative of such a large business, then that Perium can go to you. In other words, it’s a legal way of gaining Perium.\"\nThis was what ’killing two birds with one stone’ meant. Ye Jin Jin would become the representative of his business and simultaneously, become stronger.\nNot only would he be repaying her for all her hard work, but she’d also be able to use that Perium to buy more stat boosting medicine. She was definitely one of his allies, so increasing her strength would help Lee Shin Woo as well.\nEven to him, his plan was perfect. However, Ye Jin Jin seemed to oppose his decision.\n\"I can’t do that! I want to help you, not steal your karma...!\"\n\"I’ll be honest with you.\"\nHe knew from the very beginning that she wouldn’t be comfortable with this proposal, due to her inherent honest and genuine nature. Lee Shin Woo snorted as if he were waiting for her to try to continue and replied.\n\"Giving you some Perium won’t hurt me in the least. I have more than 2.5 billion Perium on me right now.\"\n\"2.5... billion...\"\nYe Jin Jin’s face stiffened. The medicine cost 500,000 a pop. With 2.5 billion Perium, she could reach level 7 (3,200 stats needed), purely through the medicine, and still have 900 million Perium left over. Ye Jin Jin was well aware of how great a matter this was.\n\"This is beyond amazing... Mr. Shin Woo, you’re really...\"\n\"This is all the money I’ve accumulated from the Underground Empire. If my business takes off on the surface, then I can make even more. So, you understand now that it won’t make a dent on my Perium, right?\"\n\"...Yes, I understand.\"\nLee Shin Woo spoke confidently so Ye Jin Jin felt less burdened. Instead, she thought something like, ’He’s progressed so quickly, yet he’s amassed so much Perium. Lee Shin Woo truly is amazing!’. He supposed it couldn’t be helped that her impression of him had become even greater than before.\n\"I’ll accept the Perium from you, use it to increase my abilities, and then fight together with you on the frontlines. That’s ok with you, right?\"\n\"Good, you understand. I want you to be Lawrence’s representative, and by doing so, you will gain a lot of Perium you can use to strengthen yourself. So now we’re in agreement, right?\"\n\"Yes, I’ll do it. I’ll become strong enough to help you, no matter what!\"\nShe was so blind that Lee Shin Woo felt anxious. But in any case, she would follow him and take this opportunity to become stronger, so she would definitely be helpful to him. He accepted that reasoning and nodded his head.\n\"Alright. We’re done talking, so let’s get a move on. First, we’ll go visit the place where we make Lawrence’s most popular item.\"\n\"Most popular item... Is it the wine that’s being auctioned off? Did you make that yourself? Is it being made underground by any chance?\"\n\"Yeah. Ah, by the way, my name’s Paul Zero over there. Keep that in mind.\"\nYe Jin Jin looked puzzled while Lee Shin Woo smiled softly and led her. Fortunately, the Kerr Century Winery wasn’t very far from here, so he didn’t need to use the Heaven Door’s Key. Before he went into the winery, he took a deep breath and opened the door. What he was really afraid of was...\n[It’s Paul Zero!]\n[Did you say Paul Zero!?]\n\"Kyaaaaa!?\"\nOnce they noticed his arrival, the Dryads rushed over to him like a swarm of bees! He accepted it, as though he knew this would happen, but Ye Jin Jin saw the countless wood spirits rushing over to him and stood still.\n[Paul Zero, you came to visit!]\n\"S-Spirits... Dryads!?\"\n\"Yeah. These guys are invaluable in making the Kerr Century Wine.\"\nLee Shin Woo completely ignored Sinea, who threw herself into his arms and gave kiss after kiss on his cheek and explained the facility to Ye Jin Jin.\nThe mystery behind this facility wasn’t just the Dryads. Ye Jin Jin saw the golems dragging carts filled with grapes or rolling around oak barrels and was speechless.\n\"It really is amazing...\"\n[Paul Zero, is this one of your new friends?]\n\"Yeah. She’ll help sell the wine you guys make from now on.\"\n[I see. Would you like to eat a grape?]\n\"T-Thank you.\"\n[Hehe.]\nOnce she ate the grape, Ye Jin Jin became mute once again from the grape’s indescribable sweetness and sourness. It was cute seeing Sinea laugh with such a proud expression.\nLee Shin Woo left her alone and continued with his work. He collected the wine they’d created, and remodeled the equipment on the spot, creating a new facility to create wine. A facility that would create sparkling wine, the wine that would represent champagne!\n\"For some reason, sparkling wine doesn’t exist in this world... Even if it did, they wouldn’t be able to reproduce its special characteristic and it wouldn’t taste very good. However, our grapes can do it.\"\n[I don’t know what sparkling wine is, but we just have to do as you say, right, Paul Zero?]\nHe’d done enough prep on the surface, so remodeling the facility wasn’t very difficult. While he was at it, Lee Shin Woo decided to expand the facility, as well as the wine storehouse. The Dryads were elated at the expanded winery and flew around.\n\"Now, then. There’s something important I have to tell you.\"\n[What is it?]\n[What is it? What is it?]\nHe said once he was completely finished with the modifications, and the Dryads responded instantly. Lee Shin Woo honestly told them what had happened. That he’d procured a way to go to the surface, and that he could bring about two of them with him.\n[I see. Paul Zero, you’re really amazing!]\n[I knew you’d be able to go to the surface someday, Paul Zero!]\nThey were the Dryads, who came to the underground in search of living trees, so he had expected more of a fuss, but... their reaction wasn’t as bad as he’d expected. He tilted his head, as they may have not understood him, but Sinea then replied.\n[We’re satisfied with our life here. Plus, you’re the one who told us that the curse is threatening to affect the surface as well.]\n\"That’s true, but it’s just a chance. Moreover, isn’t the surface much more attractive than living down here?\"\n[But we like the underground better since you’re here.]\n[You can suck the curse away!]\n[Plus, we don’t want to leave a place that’s been handled by an elf.]\nLee Shin Woo listened, as the Dryads chattered away, and realized that he’d been misunderstanding all along. It was like with Ye Jin Jin as well. They were more considerate to him than he’d expected, and they were showing this consideration now.\n\"I see... Thanks.\"\n[But there might still be some of our kin or other spirits on the surface, so we may have to investigate... Alright, I’ll go as our representative. Paul Zero, please take care of me.]\n[The Princess is monopolizing Paul Zero!]\n[I’m against this!]\n[Everyone, please be quiet.]\nShe overpowered their resentment with her charisma, flew over to the vineyard, and came over with a small grapevine branch. Lee Shin Woo was confused and asked why she’d brought that over, and Sinea explained that she could return freely with that single branch.\n[I’ve grown a lot too and above all, I love this place. The other Dryads will think the same.]\n\"You’re not a normal Dryad anymore...\"\n[You’re right. I became a level 7 Elder Dryad Princess quite a while ago.]\nAt some point, she’d reached level 7 as well! Ye Jin Jin, who realized that a Dryad had even beaten her in terms of levels, felt gloomy, and Lee Shin Woo had to comfort her. Around that time, the final member that they would bring to the surface had arrived.\n[The Master of Darkness, Paul Zero. I have come at your command.]\nHe was the level 7 Wolf Avenger, Bisher Moon. When he’d come down to the Underground Empire, he’d told Bisher to come to the winery.\nLee Shin Woo had to decide which to bring with him: Shino Rendu or Bisher Moon, as he couldn’t bring the Giants or the Chimeras; their outward appearances were too frightening. He thought about it for a while and eventually decided to bring Bisher Moon, as he could use magic, while Shino Rendu only possessed combat abilities.\n[I divided my troops and entrusted them to Shino Rendu and Chi Paul. They’re all fighting bravely right now. Most of the 12 generals won’t even be able to scratch your forces.]\n\"Good.\"\nThat’s right. The Empire wasn’t stable yet, but they couldn’t just remain in hiding forever, so Lee Shin Woo was carefully commanding his undead forces from the shadows.\nHe decided not to use the Giants unless they were needed, as they were quite conspicuous. His elite undead and golems moved covertly and cut down the Undead Empire’s numbers bit by bit. If one of the 12 generals appeared, then Lee Shin Woo could just go over there. That’s why he’d been grateful to have the Heaven Door’s Key!\n\"Mr. Shin Woo, this Lycanthrope...\"\n\"Remember what he looks like since he’s your senior. Since we’re all here, let’s go.\"\nHe was really worried how effective his forces would be without the Heaven Defying General, but Lee Shin Woo couldn’t always stick around with his troops. After he sent a brief message to Shino Rendu and the other commanders, Lee Shin Woo created a gate to the surface.\nThe biggest auction on the surface awaited him.",

    "content": "<Chapter 39. New Party Member - 3>\nLee Shin Woo and his party returned to the surface, and his first order of business was to take measures (e.g. disguise Ye Jin Jin) to establish her as Lawrence’s representative. And it had proceeded quite smoothly.\n\"My name is Izuna. I’m Mr. Lawrence’s attendant and representative.\" Thıs text ıs hosted at Novᴇl_Fire(.)net\n\"Hmm, what’s Mr. Lawrence doing right now...?\"\n\"He’s left everything to me, so if you have business with him, then you can just tell me instead.\"\n\"Hoh, he’s left everything to you, huh. You two seem quite close... My my, I feel left out.\"\n\"I will proceed with Mr. Lawrence’s contracts as scheduled. Please take care of me.\"\nJust a few days ago, Lee Shin Woo thought of her as an idiot, but when he saw the sight before him, he was honestly a bit shocked. He’d trained her quite thoroughly, but he hadn’t expected her to act so perfectly!\n’This is the strength of a woman in love. She’s working so hard to be of help to you. She really is amazing.’\n’Why are you being so sarcastic? Just compliment her.’\n’I’m just so touched; her love transcends life and death.’\n’You know, that’s the very definition of sarcasm.’\nFrom what he’d remembered, Jin and Ye Jin Jin had been really close, but for some reason, Jin was in a bad mood once they met on the surface. By the time he’d replied to Jin’s complaints and raised his head, the merchants that had come to the Lawrence shop had all left.\nYe Jin Jin was dressed formally without any frills, wore light makeup, and her hair was tied tightly. She, who looked like a skilled merchant that had popped straight out of a novel, stared at him with unease.\n\"W-was that ok, Mr. Shin Woo?\"\n\"Yeah. It was perfect, Izuna.\"\n\"When it’s just the two of us, please call me Jin Jin.\"\nYe Jin Jin blushed and requested carefully; as Jin had said, she looked like the very definition of a woman in love. Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and when he was about to reply, a skeleton horse’s head came through the window.\n\"I’m here too, Jin Jin.\"\n\"Heok, I-I’m sorry! That’s not what I meant...\"\nAs expected, something did go on between them, considering the bad blood between them... He wondered whether he should arbitrate this matter or not, but for some reason, he felt like he’d make it even worse if he acted hastily, so he gave up on it.\n\"Just keep acting like that from now on. You may be my representative, but you won’t have to worry about the business itself. Just fool the guys that come over and you’ll be fine.\"\n\"B-But still, you should give me something to do.\"\n\"I mean, there’s nothing for you to really do... I’ve found some places nearby that are around your level, so go around and work hard when you have the time.\"\n\"O-Ok!\"\nShe replied so enthusiastically that it felt as though she’d go hunt a dragon if Lee Shin Woo told her to. Even though he felt uneasy as he looked at her, he passed over the materials he’d prepared through the golem network.\n[Paul Zero, I’ve planted all the trees!]\n\"Ooh.\"\nAround that time, he’d even given the Elder Dryad Princess, Sinea, some work to do. He’d wanted her to plant the branch she’d brought with her near his residence, but she said she’d make this entire area hers so that she could use her powers however she wished.\n[If I plant another branch someplace else, then I can go back and forth.]\n\"You even have the ability to make a gate!?\"\n[There’re some downsides though. It costs a lot of mana, and if the branch gets damaged in any way, then I get hurt as well.]\nAlthough it was an unignorable downside, it was quite the reliable teleportation ability, when he took into account how much she’d have to do on the surface from now on.\n[I’ll rush over if something happens to you, Paul Zero. Here.]\n\"Thanks.\"\nSinea passed him a tree branch, which emitted the exact same energy as the previously planted branch. If he needed her, he could probably just plant the branch in the ground to summon her. The power of the spirits was formidable indeed.\n\"You’re not going with the spirit?\"\n\"Sinea will use this spot as a base camp and search for other spirits. Plus, spirits won’t show up where I’m going anyway.\"\n[I’m saddened by the fact that I can’t be together with you, even after following you up here...]\nFor the time being, Lee Shin Woo had to act as the mercenary, Kay and clear unconquered dungeons for the Sun God religion. Bringing a level 7 wood spirit there would be extremely conspicuous. Moreover, he used the fire element when masquerading as Kay, so their compatibility was terrible, which was another reason he couldn’t bring her along.\n\"Alright. Then, I’m heading off to a dungeon.\"\n\"Ok. I’ll get it done, no matter what...!\"\n[Paul Zero, if you ever want to see me, just use the branch to contact me!]\nLee Shin Woo parted with the greatly disappointed girl and spirit and left his residence. But when he got atop Jin and went towards their designated location, a shadow shrouded in darkness appeared.\n[I’ll go to the capital, Master. I apologize for not being able to stay by your side and protect you.]\n\"I’m counting on you. But be careful so you don’t die.\"\n[I’m receiving the power of the moon so close up, so I won’t die. ...I’ll prepare everything until you reach the capital, Master.]\n\"Alright. Go ahead.\"\n[Yes, sir.]\nTheir final party member, Bisher Moon was responsible for ’getting things done’. [1] Anything he couldn’t ask Ye Jin Jin or Sinea to do with the golem network’s information, he made Bisher do.\nHe’d given Bisher Moon the most dangerous task of all: entering the capital. Even Lee Shin Woo couldn’t enter the capital without any prep, so he sent Bisher Moon to the capital to make a foothold for him, as he was proficient in darkness magic and had formidable combat abilities.\n’To be frank, he’s more of a substitute, but... He said it himself, that he wouldn’t die, so he should be fine.’\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t really confident that Bisher Moon would be able to accomplish anything there, but... more importantly, Rem’s golem network was approaching the capital, so he wouldn’t end up empty handed regardless.\nIf all went well, then his position in the Magic Empire would be set, with the help of the Sun God religion and Bisher Moon... Lee Shin Woo stopped deluding himself and raised his head. Now it was really time for him to conquer a dungeon.\n\"It’s time to act once more, if for no other reason.\"\nTime flew by and 2 more weeks passed with Lee Shin Woo acting as the Sun God’s hero, Kay. During that time, the Sun God religion’s plan had indeed borne fruit. His name had spread far and wide, like a fire spreading across a field of grass.\nHis initial dungeon conquest wasn’t very effective, like using a fire move on a water type pokemon. But due to the Sun God religion’s positive publicity, as well as him conquering two or three dungeons, something no one had ever done before, it became super effective, like a fire move being used against a grass and bug type.\n\"You’ve conquered two level 5 dungeons and three level 6 dungeons... I trusted in your abilities, but you truly are amazing. Due to your efforts, several cities have been saved.\"\n\"Still,I think we’re fanning the flames a bit too much.\"\nThe Pope held a bottle of Kerr Century Elemental 451 in one hand and held a glass of the wine in the other. He tightly gripped the glass and sighed. He could see several people in the streets yelling the Sun God hero, Kay’s name.\n\"Sir Kay saw us!\"\n\"The Sun God’s hero! The Sun God is watching over him!\"\n\"Bless you, Sir Kay! Glory to the Sun God!\"\n\"Kay! Kay! Kay! Kay!\"\nThere were tens of thousands of people crowding around his lodgings; so many of them chanted his name that their voices overlapped unpleasantly, making it sound like an anthem of sorts. Lee Shin Woo was freaked out and went back inside as if running away from it.\nHe’d come to this city a week ago. The city had prepared for the worst, due to level 6 dungeon countercurrent, but Lee Shin Woo happened to be there. After he’d informed them of the Sun God religion’s intent, he quickly cleared the dungeon and then left the aftermath to the Sun God religion’s promotional unit. He then went on to the next dungeon, but once he came back, things had intensified.\n\"I can understand if you consider the fact that they’re all alive because of me, but... it’s like a religion.\"\n\"It is a religion. The Sun God must be so proud of you.\"\n\"It seems like they’re worshipping me, not the Sun God.\"\n\"You don’t need to worry about that. Since their faith in you will soon become their faith in the Sun God. It’s becoming like that in other areas as well.\"\nAll that the weakened Sun God religion had left was their believers and their worn-out honor! They would be able to sway public opinion with those two elements and the Sun God’s hero, Kay.\nAs the Pope had told him, Kay’s actions would help increase their influence, which in turn, would create new religious belief. It was only possible because it was the Sun God religion.\n\"...So how is it going on the inside (of the religious order)?\"\n\"Hoo. Hoo.\"\nLee Shin Woo said whilst narrowing his eyes, and the Pope laughed meaningfully and gave a thumbs up. He wanted to smack him, but he managed to stop himself.\n\"The best decision I’ve ever made was picking you.\"\n\"You should be facing resistance from the other religious orders, as you’re charging ahead so quickly. The Emperor won’t look at this favorably either.\"\n\"We’re looking after the people. Although we’re spicing it up a bit, who’s going to stop us? Even if they try to stop you now, the people will fight back. They won’t do something as stupid as fighting against their own people.\"\n\"Moreover,\" the Pope said and then added.\n\"You’ve been recognized as a Saint by our order, but it’s ultimately just an honorary position. You can move more freely because you’re not officially a part of our order. In other words, no one can stop you using religious rules, obligations, or duties as an excuse.\"\n\"But it’s because I’m unofficially a part of the Sun God religion that the order’s fame keeps growing.\"\n\"Exactly. Moreover, you’re a Saint recognized by the Pope himself, so no one has higher authority than you.\"\nTo think he got all the advantages but didn’t have to take any responsibility. His honorary position differed significantly from his own understanding of honorary positions, but he didn’t have any complaints.\n\"But that’s too much. Do you think I can return to Kuroa’s Glory some time tomorrow?\"\n\"Ah, now that you mention it, it’s tomorrow.\"\nThe Pope said nonchalantly and stretched out a hand towards Lee Shin Woo. His hand was now freed of the wine bottle, as it was empty and rolling on the floor.\n\"Before the auction’s over, sell me another bottle of wine at the special price.\"\n\"That’s all for today, folks! Please tune in for the next episode!\"\nHe was tired in a variety of ways, but he had to put in even more energy tomorrow.\nSince tomorrow was the day of the wine auction.\n[1] T/N: ’Getting things done’ is a loose translation. Literally, it’s more along the lines of an ’execution squad’ or something like that.",

As Lee Shin Woo had performed a never before seen feat and had returned in triumph, he did indeed look like a true hero.\n\"That man... Is he really human?\"\n\"He must’ve conquered the dungeons with the Sun God religion’s paladins and priests, but he’s still amazing.\"\n\"I knew he was amazing since the first time I saw him spewing out those endless flames and burning the undead.\"\nHe was indeed followed by a few of the Sun God religion’s paladins and priests, but the Pope hadn’t. In order to assert that Lee Shin Woo was conquering the dungeon of his own free will, the Pope remained behind, covertly directing his troops and supporting Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Is he level 8 by any chance?\"\n\"He’s obviously level 8. Perhaps... Perhaps he’s even reached level 9.\"\n\"Hey, you can’t say that! What if His Majesty were to hear you!?\"\nHe didn’t know for sure, but the citizens of the Magic Empire spread rumors that the Emperor was level 9. And based on all the info he’d gathered thus far, there was a high possibility that the Emperor was indeed level 9.\nSo, calling someone level 9 was considered an act of treason, as it was essentially equating the individual with the Emperor himself.\n’It’s quite unreasonable, as it’s not a unique title or anything... More importantly, the Undead Emperor must be level 9 if the Emperor on the surface is.’\nWhen he’d first assessed Feotane Von Seldin’s level, he assumed the Emperor would be level 9, and actually felt relieved at the news. He even thought he was lucky that he wasn’t level 10.\n’Putting aside the Emperors’ strengths, the main issue is the curse.’\nWhen he’d stopped the dungeon countercurrent, he felt a sense of foreboding, but of the dungeons he’d conquered this time around, half of the bosses were undead.\nSome of the normal monsters would transform into the undead as well. If Jin hadn’t sucked the death energy from them, then the paladins and the priests accompanying them might’ve been affected. He felt as though half of the humans on the surface would become undead in just a few years rather than dozens of years, at this rate.\nHe knew about this, so shouldn’t the Emperor know about this as well? No, even an idiot would notice what was going on. If that’s the case, then how would the Emperor react? No, how did he view the Underground Empire?\nLee Shin Woo had to go to the capital, if for no other reason than to find that out.\n\"Sir Kay, are you going back home?\"\n\"No, I’m going to the auction house.\"\n\"Ah, that’s right. You were backing this auction.\"\n\"You never know what might happen, so we’ll accompany you.\"\nOne of the priests asked, and Lee Shin Woo replied nonchalantly and led Jin. Since news had spread that Lawrence was protected by the Sun God religion, there was a low chance of anything going wrong at the auction, but since this was the first ’main event’ he’d started on the surface, he’d feel sad if he didn’t witness it firsthand.\nAlthough the priests and paladins knew just how pointless guarding him was, as they’d seen a glimpse of his strength by accompanying his dungeon conquests, it was still their duty, so they followed him quietly.\n\"Oh, it’s already started.\"\n\"It’s really big...\"\nThey had originally planned to use the store building for the auction, but because so many people (it might’ve been different if they were all peasants, but each and every one of them were high ranking aristocrats or the top business leaders) wished to participate, a huge auction house had been set up instead.\nWhat was most surprising was that the auction house was filled to the brim. When Lee Shin Woo stepped foot into the auction house, it was quite hot inside, so much so that he almost mistook it for the auction house burning down.\n[160,000 Perium! We have 160,000 Perium for this bottle of Kerr Century Elemental 451! Do we have 165,000!? Ah, we have 170,000 Perium! I repeat, we have 170,000 Perium!]\nOnce he’d entered the auction house, Lee Shin Woo heard the auctioneer’s resounding voice and wondered if he’d misheard. He’d sold a bottle to the Pope (at the special price) for 77,000 Perium. But what? One bottle is being sold for 170,000?\n’I sold 1 liter of Kerr Century Dellocus 395 to Pleine for about 500,000 Perium, so a bottle (700 ml) should be worth about 350,000 Perium. Well, that’s accounting for the steep premium due to its age. But what’s going on...’\nAlthough he’d revived the Kerr Century technique, he was only able to create the wine with an elf and the Dryads’ help. But one bottle was being sold for 170,000 Perium?\n[We have 210,000 Perium!]\nWait a sec. It just went over 200,000 Perium!\n[Ah, the first successful bid is 230,000 Perium! Please remain on edge, there are 49 more bottles left to auction off individually! After that, we’ll be auctioning off at least 10 bottles at a time, so make sure you don’t lose your chance!]\nLee Shin Woo had prepared 1,500 bottles of Kerr Century Elemental 451 for the auction. He couldn’t sell it all to one person, and he also couldn’t sell them all individually, so the auction had become structured this way. He’d been worried, wondering how it would turn out, but after seeing this, he realized how effective it was.\nIn order to buy 10 bottles of Kerr Century wine, the buyer had to be extremely powerful. Following that logic, poorer buyers had no choice but to go for the individual bottles of wine. Because they had a limited supply of wine, whenever a bottle of wine was sold, the restlessness of the crowd would increase... In the end, the price of his wine increased exponentially.\nHe’d thought it wasn’t a very good idea, but it was unexpectedly quite effective. Actually, if the product was good enough, then the seller could always raise the asking price.\n[330,000 Perium! Sold at 330,000 Perium!]\nWhile Lee Shin Woo was busy thinking, the fourth bottle of wine was sold for an additional 100,000 Perium. His contracted merchants had promoted the product and had even given wine tastings, but this had really far exceeded his expectations.\nHey, wait a second. The last winning bidder was the Sun God religion’s Pope!\n\"He’s supposed to be sponsoring this event. What the hell is he doing?\"\n\"Perhaps he’s sponsoring the event by buying it at such a high price...\"\nWhile Lee Shin Woo and the priests looked on vacantly, the auction began to heat up. Some of the participants grimaced at the increasing prices, but then, Lawrence’s representative, Izuna (Ye Jin Jin) picked up one of the bottles.\n\"What a waste.\"\n\"Huh...?\"\nOf course, it wasn’t up for sale, but a promotional item. Once she opened the top, the entire auction house was filled with the aroma of the wine, which meant that a magical device had been used. Lee Shin Woo took a whiff of the wine and even he was in awe of his product. It had been a long time since he’d missed his sense of taste.\n\"T-This aroma... Ooh.\"\n\"Why did such a skilled winemaker have to go underground?\"\n\"Oh my god. Was this really made by a human?\" Google seaʀᴄh novelFɪre.net\nThe wine’s aroma had caused a huge commotion within the auction house, yet Ye Jin Jin, spoke calmly, unbefitting her. Of course, her voice resounded throughout the auction house as well.\n\"My magic device doesn’t have the ability to magnify scents. This is simply the wine’s natural aroma. Anyone who buys a bottle of wine is free to sample this promotional product.\"\nThe effect was explosive. The flames of the auction had begun to die down, but her actions refueled the fires, causing all the participants to spend all their savings on the auction.\nAfter that, the winning bid for the fifth bottle of wine was more than 450,000 Perium, and the sixth had surpassed 500,000. It was madness.\n\"She’s good...\"\nAnd Ye Jin Jin had been the orchestrator. He’d trained her, of course, but she was the one who’d intervened at just the right time. Anyone who’d seen this wouldn’t suspect her role as representative of the Lawrence shop.\n\"Sir Kay, the young silver-haired man sitting at the upper right is the Third Prince of the Empire.\"\n\"Even the Imperial family came. Though there’s probably nothing I can learn from them...\"\nThe Third Prince, who had likely come to figure out who was behind the Lawrence shop, had become intoxicated by the smell and was upping his bid. The high ranking nobles and the other high ranking priests of the other religious orders (who opposed the Sun God religion’s sudden ascent in popularity) were no different.\nAll these individuals, who each had their own reasons for coming here, had abandoned those goals and focused entirely on the wine. What a nice sight!\n’Can’t I gather all of the money on the surface with wine...? No, wait. I can get all this money without it, so why the hell am I posing as a hero!?’\nSo much had happened that he hadn’t expected, so Lee Shin Woo was dumbstruck. However, the auction continued on, and ultimately, he had sold all 1,500 bottles of the Kerr Century Elemental 451 for a whopping total of 670 million Perium.\nBut the highlight of the event was Ye Jin Jin saying, \"We plan on introducing the Kerr Century Sparkling Elemental next season, so look forward to it.\" Once she said that, the participants began to fight desperately and scheme against each other so that they could participate in the next auction; it was something worth seeing, better than anything he’d seen in the Underground Empire.\n\"Izuna.\"\n\"Sir Kay. I’m glad you’re alright.\"\nOnce the auction was over and the goods were transferred, Lee Shin Woo found Ye Jin Jin and encouraged her. While they both looked after the Lawrence shop, Ye Jin Jin was Lawrence’s representative and therefore knew she had to maintain a safe distance from Lee Shin Woo. However, she’d managed to take care of everything quite well.\n\"Good work.\"\n\"You worked hard too, Sir Kay.\"\nShe had already reached level 6 and looked much calmer than before. Perhaps her emotions had calmed down, as she knew that she was being helpful to him.\nHe didn’t pinpoint the exact reason, but he was satisfied, as Ye Jin Jin’s condition seemed to have improved. Once he’d looked around the auction house and confirmed that there was nothing amiss, he said.\n\"You can all go now.\"\n\"Sir Kay, when will the next auction be?\"\n\"I’ve already told the Pope, but I’d like to do it before things become worse.\"\nThe auction had ended in a great success. Bisher Moon and Rem, both of which were in the capital right now, should be working together to create a foothold for him, and he had confirmed Ye Jin Jin’s physical and mental growth, so...\n\"I guess I should go to the capital. On the way there, tell the Pope.\"\n\"Of what...?\"\n\"That I’d like to start conquering level 7 dungeons.\"\nThe priests simultaneously adopted an expression similar to Munch’s ’The Scream’ [1], but Lee Shin Woo just ignored them and hastened his pace.\nThen 20 minutes later, he got an unexpected report from Sinea.\n[1] E/N: https://i.imgur.com/nuPFwMz.jpg",

    "content": "<Chapter 39. New Party Member - 5>\n\"You’ve found traces of spirits, huh.\"\n[Yeah. I found a message they left behind. If I trace the message, we might be able to find living spirits.]\nLee Shin Woo, who’d returned to his lodging, was hugged by Sinea (no matter how he thought about it, the spirits’ ’skinship’ was too much) and he looked at her again. Although she seemed happy in his arms, she sported a complicated expression.\n[To be honest, I don’t expect there to be any living spirits. We’ll probably just find where they had lived...]\n\"Why is that?\"\n[Mm. Once I became an Elder Dryad Princess, I was able to very faintly see through our entire species’ memories... It’s a blurry memory, an image of when the spirits were driven from the surface.]\n...Why was she telling him this now? Lee Shin Woo stared softly at her and Sinea sported a prickly expression and explained.\n[It hasn’t been very long since I became level 7, Paul Zero. Plus, I didn’t think there was any reason to tell you since the memories were fragmented and there hadn’t been a way of getting to the surface before.]\n\"Hoo... It’s fine. Keep going.\"\n[Ok. According to my ancestors’ memories, the humans feared the spirits’ power and ostracized them. Contrary to magic, which could be fully controlled by humans, spirits possessed a power that was erratic and atypical, which couldn’t be trusted. So, not only were contractors oppressed and killed, but the Magic Empire also attempted to drive out the spirits from this world.]\nHe felt like he’d heard something really important at an unexpected moment. Moreover, something she said bothered him: that the Empire was trying to drive out the spirits.\n\"They attempted to drive them out... With the others?\"\n[Yeah, probably.]\n\"So, the Underground Empire wasn’t formed by a gathering of eccentric individuals, but by those who were driven out of the Magic Empire.\"\nThey were driven out because of the spirits? No, that probably wasn’t the only reason. Perhaps those ostracized by the Empire were gathered up all at once and were banished underground, like gathering a bunch of criminals and putting them in prison.\n\"The spirits must’ve not liked the underground very much then?\"\n[It probably wasn’t a very conducive environment for them, regardless of the presence of death energy. Though it’s a livable place for us Dryads due to your help, Paul Zero.]\n\"Then, why didn’t they escape from the surface? Wait, I suppose I should be asking why they couldn’t escape... There shouldn’t have been much death energy back then either.\"\nYeah, this was the core of the matter. From the very beginning, Lee Shin Woo didn’t think that the Underground Empire had been formed and developed naturally.\nThe Underground Empire was built by those who had been driven from the surface. If that’s the case, then why were they stuck underground... or turning it around, why couldn’t they ’return to the surface’?\n’And if I’m right, then it’s because...’\nNow it was time to check his answer. Lee Shin Woo looked squarely at Sinea. Sinea looked shy and turned her head away.\n[Don’t look at me like that. It’s embarrassing.]\n\"Hey.\"\n[Sorry, but I don’t know anymore. However, I do know that the spirits and the people underground wanted to escape like you said. Even if they had to risk their lives in doing so...]\n\"Risking their lives, huh...\"\nLee Shin Woo repeated after Sinea like a parrot and recalled the Underground Empire.\nAlthough it possessed an artificial sun, the world always seemed dreary, grey and was teeming with the undead. The master of these undead, the Emperor... Did he really seek immortality? Probably not. He sought something beyond that.\n\"...As I thought, I really need to see the Emperor at least once, face-to-face.\"\n[Paul Zero, can I keep going? It’s regarding the traces of the spirits.]\n\"Ah, sure. Now that you mention it, we went off topic. Keep going.\"\nHe had forgotten what she’d originally brought up, as he’d been thinking about the capital, the Empire, and the Underground Empire. Lee Shin Woo urged her to keep going, and Sinea continued calmly.\n[So, there probably aren’t any that are still alive, but there’s a high chance that spiritual power or an artifact that contains the spirits’ power resides within the place the spirits once lived. If we can, I’d like to collect those.]\n\"Alright. Then let’s go together.\"\n[You’re willing to come with me!?]\n\"The surface is just as dangerous as the underground, so I can’t just send you off by yourself... Moreover, I just sent the Pope a message, so it’ll be some time before I can move to the capital.\"\nMoreover, establishing a branch of the Lawrence shop in Kuroa’s Glory wouldn’t take just a day or two. He’d already made various preparations with the help of the merchant’s guild, but it would still take some time before Ye Jin Jin could fully take the reins, so Lee Shin Woo was currently free.\n[Hoo. Hoo. Thanks. I knew I wasn’t wrong.]\n\"While we’re at it, let’s go.\"\nLee Shin Woo and Sinea went down to the 1st floor. Ye Jin Jin was listlessly sitting on the sofa.\n\"You did good, Ye Jin Jin.\"\n\"Ah, Mr. Shin Woo! Eut.\"\nOnce she noticed Lee Shin Woo, Ye Jin Jin’s eyes shined and she stood up. However, she immediately sunk back down onto the sofa. She had acted like a completely different person at the auction house and it seemed like it was all catching up to her now.\nSeeing that, Lee Shin Woo thought, ’it sure is a pain being human’. Mental fatigue had a direct effect on the body.\n\"Rest up. But since you’re going to taking over starting tomorrow, it’ll become a lot busier around here.\"\n\"Ah, ok.\"\nLee Shin Woo couldn’t just leave Ye Jin Jin in Kuroa’s Glory. Since she needed to act as Lawrence’s representative in the capital as well. The Lawrence shop would draw even more attention to itself, due to today’s events, so she would have to work even harder in the capital.\nIf he knew it would be this much trouble, then he wouldn’t have created the Lawrence identity and would’ve had the hero, Kay manage the shop instead. However, he hadn’t known things would turn out this way, so there was nothing he could do about it.\n\"Um, then what are you going to be doing, Mr. Shin Woo?\"\n\"I’ll be back soon. It’s a matter regarding the spirits.\"\n\"The spirits... Mm, I want to go too.\" Fınd the newest release on novelꞁire.net\nWhile Lee Shin Woo considered Sinea an ally, Ye Jin Jin thought differently; she had already considered her a rival.\nShe was reluctant to let her rival and Lee Shin Woo go together without her, but unfortunately, her body wouldn’t comply right now. Then at the very least...\n\"Then, Jin is going with you as well, right?\"\n\"Ah, yeah. That’s probably for the best.\"\n\"That’s a relief. Please take care.\"\n[Tch.]\nLee Shin Woo didn’t know what Ye Jin Jin was trying to say and tilted his head, but it seemed as though Sinea understood her, as she openly clicked her tongue. She could only do that because she didn’t know that Jin was the reason that the death energy was sucked from their bodies.\n\"How far is it?\"\n[Mm, with this horse’s speed... It’ll take 6 hours if you go with me. We could’ve taken our time if we were alone, though it would’ve taken a lot longer... Tch.]\n\"Ho.\"\nJin was surprised when he heard her. Even though he’d reached level 7, it would take them 6 hours to get there, so they might circle around the Magic Empire. Jin was genuinely happy, as it had been a long time since he’d run at max speed, but Lee Shin Woo had a hunch.\n\"Is it spatial magic?\"\n[As expected of you, Paul Zero. Yeah, the mana is interfering with the space. A magic that allows you to go there wherever you are in the world, but also makes it difficult to get there... Normally, non-spirits cannot go in, but you should be able to, right Paul Zero?]\n\"Yeah, I should be able to.\"\nHe could already create life or death energy. Imitating the spirits’ mana wouldn’t necessarily be easier than creating life or death energy, but he should be able to copy Sinea’s mana somehow, as he’d observed her for such a long time.\nIn addition, he’d become adept at disguising other’s mana, so he should be able to bring Jin along with him no problem.\n[Good. Then let’s go. We have to go to a secluded place first.]\n\"Ok.\"\nThey left the city immediately. Lee Shin Woo shabbily disguised the two of them (Sinea could disguise herself; to see through her disguise, the opponent would need to be a higher level than her, or be a spirit), and it was already dusk by the time they left the city.\n\"So now what?\"\n[Paul Zero, assimilate my mana.]\nLee Shin Woo matched his mana with hers. He could easily make his mana resemble hers, as he used the Mana Bone, Mana Acceleration, and even the Disguise skill. In the process, Lee Shin Woo’s body shook like leaves blowing in the spring breeze, and became very slightly translucent.\n\"Oh, so a spirit’s mana has this kind of effect.\"\n[Paul Zero, how closely did you copy me...?]\nSinea was speechless at the sight. Lee Shin Woo hadn’t just nonchalantly copied a spirit’s mana, but he had made his body like a spirit’s!\nIt was no longer on the level of changing one’s mana; he was changing his very existence. Where the hell would you find a level 7 like this? Even a level 8, or a level 9 Archmage wouldn’t be able to enact this miracle!\n\"Oh. I kept using my Disguise skill after I came to the surface, so I got a lot more familiar with it. I should be seeing a message right about now... Oh, there it is.\"\nWhenever Lee Shin Woo did something crazy, a skill message would appear as if waiting for that moment. But that message, like always, was shocking.\n[The Disguise skill has become Lv9. Nothing is as it appears. You disguise truth as lies and show this to the world. If you succeed in fooling all, then it becomes no different from being real. Change is a form of creation. You only have one task that remains. You already know what that is.]\n[You have indirectly gained the power of a Dryad, and have been approved by the world. You have acquired the High Rank Earth Element Lv1. Magic has increased by 100. You have acquired High Rank Earth Resistance Lv3. Magic has increased by 120.]\n\"Oh, ooh...?\"\n\"I’m not sure what it is, but you got another cheat skill, didn’t you? Give me that.\"\n\"Mm, my bad. I don’t think I can give it to you just yet.\"\nOnce he’d gained a Dryad’s power, Lee Shin Woo immediately disguised Jin and attempted to give him the Earth element and resistance, but he couldn’t, perhaps because he hadn’t yet mastered the skill. He was limited to disguising Jin’s mana to resemble a spirit’s.\n[It’s the Earth element. Since we (the Dryads) rely on trees, we can only use that power through trees, but you’ve memorized the Earth element, so you should be able to use it now, Paul Zero.]\n\"Yeah. I think so too.\"\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t analyzing the Earth element right now. He had this feeling when his Disguise skill went up to level 9.\n’I think I can fully transform into a human now. Not just the outside, but even the internal organs; a proper human... Ha, like this?’\nWhy had been so conservative with the Invisible Heart, gathered so much Perium, and attempted to study said Perium... Lee Shin Woo felt skeptical. Indeed, things didn’t always go as Lee Shin Woo wanted.\nLee Shin Woo had finally become able to transform into a human.",

    "content": "<Chapter 39. New Party Member - 6>\nAccording to Sinea, the ’Spirits’ Road’ was only accessible by spirits. Lee Shin Woo moved under her guidance, and at some point, the surrounding environment became faint, with a silver transparent layer of mana hanging under their feet. It felt like they’d entered a shimmering light tunnel.\nIt felt similar to the Giants’ domain, where they were isolated by spatial magic. However, the sense of distortion was far more intense. Is it because only spirits could enter? He felt like he would either get thrown out or never be able to enter again if he was careless.\n[Paul Zero, you have to follow me.]\n\"Ok.\"\n\"...Shin Woo, are you ok? You’ve been strange since way back. Is this ’spirit transformation’ thing that hard on you?\"\n\"Ah, no. It’s nothing.\"\n’He’s only sharp when it comes to situations like this,’ Lee Shin Woo inwardly muttered. Now wasn’t the time to be deep in thought and study the ’Spirits’ Road’. Jin was one of the reasons for that.\n’I can fully transform into a human with the Disguise skill now, but I can’t use it to that extent on others yet. If Jin figures this out, then he’ll be really sad.’\nHe figured that the final remaining task was related to it, but he had no way of figuring out what that task actually was. Lee Shin Woo had no idea how to increase his skill level going forward.\nFor the time being, Lee Shin Woo was getting adjusted to the leveled up Disguise skill by maintaining the spirit transformation, but...\n’I should transform into a human when Jin’s not looking...’\nLee Shin Woo was human. He wanted to sleep, he wanted to have sex, and he wanted to eat. Once he realized he could regain all the things he’d enjoyed as a human being, he cheered and wanted to go through with it. But out of consideration for his partner, Jin, he endured with superhuman patience. If he looked ’strange’, then it was because of that.\nAnd there was one other reason. That was...\n’I figured this out once I succeeded in transforming into a human. Ultimately, life and death, humans, the undead, or even the Dryads only look different on the outside; they are essentially the same at their roots. It’s just a matter of perception. Like how I’ve fooled everything with my Disguise skill...’\nLee Shin Woo didn’t know how much hardship and suffering one had to go through to come to this realization. He came to this realization by using the Joker’s innate skills however he wished.\nReaching the truth so sloppily was perhaps a fitting end to a swindler. Though if God figured that out, then she’d be shocked.\n’But if that’s the case, then there’s a big problem. The source of my life, or the Invisible Heart skill is...’\nUntil now, he’d thought that his ’life force’ had been stored in an invisible container called the Invisible Heart. He’d first thought of the idea after he’d encountered the archmage lich.\nHowever, he was wrong. An ambiguous energy like life force didn’t actually exist. Even if it did, Lee Shin Woo could create it, and it would only be another type of energy like mana.\n’Now that I think about it, the Archmage probably sealed his soul, not his life force.’\nHe wouldn’t die, even if his body was destroyed, because he’d sealed his soul into a separate container. Then that would explain that disharmony he sensed then... Although the Archmage had been right in front of him, he couldn’t sense his ’essence’ and only felt a bizarre feeling.\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo’s soul was contained in his body, so he was built differently from a Lich. In other words, the Lich’s ability wouldn’t help him learn more about the Invisible Heart!’\n’Then what is the Invisible Heart?’\nOf course, now that he could freely transform into a human, there wasn’t anything wrong with ignoring that matter for now. Rather, there was nothing better, as he could maintain a human form while retaining multiple lives.\nBut despite that, he couldn’t help his curiosity due to his instincts as a Joker. It was his nature to understand and control everything, so he couldn’t help but pay attention to this unmeasurable power.\n’Alright. Let’s go with this hypothesis. I thought my life force was replaced by a level 100+ Invisible Heart skill, but I already know that that’s not true. Therefore, my life and the Invisible Heart skill aren’t the same.’\nHe came to the conclusion that God had tricked him, but he also thought she didn’t do what she claimed needed to be done.\nIn other words, she could’ve given him the Invisible Heart skill with no strings attached, but she had taken his life and turned him into a skeleton with the excuse that ’it was too hard’.\n’...My grudge can wait. In any case, Invisible Heart’s more important.’\nIf he assumed that his previous hypotheses were correct, then the Invisible Heart was the goddess’s power, not his own. Perhaps it was a crystallization of divinity.\nIt made sense, as the max level of Invisible Heart would go up whenever he completed one of the goddess’s tasks.\n’If I can make this power my own, then would it help me against powerful opponents?’ ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ novelFɪre.net\nIf he could imitate it with his mana, then he should be able to use Invisible Heart infinitely. At the very least, he would become a true, immortal undead. No, it wouldn’t be that easy. He couldn’t even figure out where to start.\n[Paul Zero, we’re almost there.]\n\"Ah, already?\"\n[By human standards, we’ve already run for five hours.]\nSinea called him, and Lee Shin Woo stopped thinking so much and replied. It seemed like Sinea knew that he hadn’t been paying attention to her, as she replied while sulking.\nIn order to best handle the Invisible Heart, he’d made various plans and practiced, yet five hours had passed in the blink of an eye. Lee Shin Woo was slightly surprised.\n\"As I thought, there’s something going on with you, isn’t there?\"\n\"Mm, I was just thinking about my ability. I’ll tell you about it later if I figure it out.\"\n\"It feels like it’s more important than that... Whatever, it’s fine, since you’ll tell me about it later.\"\nLee Shin Woo replied and remembered something. Now that he thought about it, Jin possessed a different type of revival skill than him. If he figured out how Invisible Heart worked, then he would look into Jin’s Blessing of Death. He also had to look into Perium as well.\nAlthough Lee Shin Woo was diligently completing his tasks, he had more to do each and every day; it made him think back to his days as an employee, which very slightly depressed him.\n\"No, it’s still a lot better than when I was an employee.\"\n\"You’re using that excuse again.\"\nLee Shin Woo and Jin followed Sinea. Their surroundings remained cloudy, but they found a small entrance to a cave at the end of their path.\nAlthough they were already in a subspace, they had to go even further within. It was only natural that the surface dwellers didn’t find it.\n\"Can the Underground Empire not make something like this?\"\n[10 billion spirits weren’t enough to create a space this large while bearing the curse.]\n\"Ah, that’s right. Sorry.\"\n[It’s ok. ...Hoo.]\nSinea complained, so Lee Shin Woo comforted her by stroking her head. She quickly returned to her old self. Lee Shin Woo thought it was quite nice that spirits were so easy to fool, but he didn’t dare say it out loud.\n[Let’s go in, Paul Zero. I only came with hopes of a small trace of them, but if it’s sealed this perfectly, then... there may actually be living spirits here.]\n\"Yeah.\"\nFYI, he had already revealed his true name to her when they arrived at the surface. But because he hadn’t formed an official contract with her, it apparently didn’t matter if he used a false name or not. On the contrary, she had been overjoyed that he’d revealed his true name to her, albeit belatedly... Even so, she said that she was still more comfortable with his false name, so she kept calling him Paul Zero.\n[This way. Follow me. Nothing strikes me as dangerous yet.]\n\"Ok.\"\nSinea went into the cave first. The moment she did, the inside of the cave lit up weakly, as if sensing her presence and welcoming her. Lee Shin Woo and Jin followed suit and carefully entered...\n[Level 9 dungeon - You have acquired the permit to the Spirits’ Spring. All stats increase by 100 within the dungeon. The dungeon’s information is added to your minimap. All actions are buffed within the dungeon.]\nAnd then stopped. He heard a phrase that he swear he’d heard somewhere before, albeit a long time ago.\n\"...The Spirits’ Spring?\"\n[The Spirits’ Spring? ...The Spirits’ Spring!? This is the Spirits’ Spring!?]\nSinea belatedly realized what he was saying and was shocked. Yeah, she should know about it too. After all, he’d originally heard about the Spirits’ Spring from the contaminated Dryads protecting their dungeon!\n[The Spirits’ Spring existed on the surface!?]\n\"If you don’t know what’s going on, then what am I supposed to do?\"\nAt the time, the Dryads had degenerated due to the curse... and one of the Corrupted Dryads had given him a Spirits’ Spring Key Fragment. While also saying that he had to give it to the Spirit General; if he did, she would take care of everything and would protect the spirits.\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo had pocketed the Spirits’ Spring Key Fragment and had put the matter on hold. However, that matter was being brought to his attention once again. So, he trusted that Sinea would add her own explanation to this, but looking at her now, she wasn’t reacting any differently than him.\n[Since all I know about the Spirits’ Spring is what I’ve heard from the other Dryads! It’s said to be the paradise for all spirits, but I thought it was referring to the spirit world!]\n\"So the spirit world does exist?\"\n[I have no idea!]\nAh, crap. He’d suspected this, but she was no help whatsoever. No, wait. Should he be thankful that she even led him to the Spirits’ Spring? Lee Shin Woo sighed and took another step forward. Then, his chest radiated light.\n[The Spirits’ Springs’ Key Fragment is reacting to the Spirits’ Springs’ energy. The artifact is being restored.]\n[You have acquired the Spirits’ Spring Key. The Heaven Door’s Key reacts to the artifact and the artifact is absorbed.]\n[You can now open a passageway to the Spirits’ Spring with the Heaven Door’s Key. You have become more familiar with the Heaven Door’s Key. By using more mana and bones, the passage can now fit up to 12 people.]\n\"Ah, it happened again.\"\nHe’d become used to this happening. It was an artifact that even absorbed God’s power, so this was nothing! While Lee Shin Woo was thinking that, something appeared before him.\n[I sense that the long lost key has returned... An irregular has come.]\nIt was a huge entity. The entity was slightly translucent like Sinea but was also covered in flickering flames... a lizard that looked as though it had been injured somewhere.\n[Lv7 Elder Salamander Prince Zenon]\nA living spirit had appeared before them.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 39 part7",
    "content": "<Chapter 39. New Party Member - 7>\nThe giant flame lizard, the Elder Salamander Prince Zenon, was a spirit on the same level as Sinea, evidenced by his level and his naming convention. As spirits, they were the peak of their respective elements and were incredibly rare.\n[Since spirits don’t naturally grow on their own, contractors are indispensable. These factors... stimuli, experiences, will, all have an effect on a spirit’s growth.]\n\"Then what about you, Sinea?\"\n[Me? Well... you and I are pretty much already contracted, Paul Zero.]\nLee Shin Woo asked, and for some reason, Sinea blushed and seemed embarrassed. That was enough for him to figure out what was going on. When he gave her the spirit stone in the past, she awakened as a Dryad Princess and a contract of sorts was formed between them.\n[...It seems like you have met a good contractor. How enviable.]\nZenon breathed out a tiny bit of flame, and gazed at Sinea. It didn’t seem like he was being sarcastic; it looked like he was genuinely jealous of Sinea.\nThe reason was easily explainable. Sinea just said it. A contractor was essential for a spirit to reach level 7. Zenon must’ve had a contractor in the past as well. Of course, it didn’t really matter at this point.\nLee Shin Woo gazed at the injured flame lizard, and spoke his mind.\n\"You’re name is Zenon, right? I’d like you to tell me about the Spirits’ Spring, as well as how you got here. ...How you lost your contractor, and what happened to the other spirits. Could you tell me?\"\n[You said you came from the Underground Empire? If that’s the case, then you should already have a grasp on the situation; do you really need to hear it from me? Are you trying to make me suffer?]\n\"You see, I wanted proof. I’ve been looking for proof ever since I came up to the surface.\"\nThat’s right. The purpose of his dual identities, Lawrence and Kay, was to find proof of what had happened. He’d never thought of himself as hero material and he certainly didn’t intend to meet God’s expectations, but... he felt like it was his obligation to figure out what had happened to divide the underground and the surface.\nIn order to appease the souls of the countless undead he’d slain thus far, as well as the other heroes who have fought on the same battlefield with him, albeit briefly.\n[Is that so... Fine. I ran away that day; perhaps this is the reason I survived. Follow me. I’ll guide you.]\nThe salamander turned his body. Lee Shin Woo, Jin, and Sinea glanced at each other and followed him. However, the inside of the cave didn’t match his original expectations of the Spirits’ Spring.\nIt was known as the paradise of spirits, or the origin of spirits... a bright place filled to the brim with magic, and a place overflowing with the aroma of spirits. A place that all spirits yearned for as if it were their hometown... That’s what he’d thought it was, at least.\n\"...A shelter?\"\n\"Hey.\"\n[Indeed.]\nJin blurted out and Lee Shin Woo quickly retorted. However, Zenon looked nonchalant and nodded his head.\n[Of course, it wasn’t like this in the beginning. It was formed from the collective will of the spirits and was a resting place for all spirits. A place that welcomed all spirits, which was akin to a spirit’s hometown. However, that was all in the past. Ever since ’that day’, it’s become a shelter for all the escaped spirits. ...Perhaps it would be more accurate to call it a place of exile.]\nThere were several spirits that dwelled within the Spirits’ Spring aside from Zenon. All of the said spirits were wounded, with wounds big or small, but their mental scars were worse than their physical ones. Although their minds should be sound, their eyes were lifeless, and merely leaned upon the trees, the spring, or the walls.\nWhat’s the point of a beautiful interior when its inhabitants were exhausted? Wherever he looked, the scattered spirits looked as though they were dead, and he didn’t really know what to think. Sinea was currently looking for any Dryads that might be inside.\n\"You can’t heal your wounds... No, you’ve chosen not to heal them.\"\n[Spirits are living beings composed entirely of mana and a soul. If we lack in either, then we don’t heal.]\n\"...How sad.\"\nBut aside from the inhabitants, the Spirits’ Spring did indeed meet his expectations. He could feel the overflowing spiritual power (of various elements) everywhere and enjoyed the mysterious, natural objects that were formed from rock, water, and flames.\nThere were several objects akin to Sinea’s spirit stone rolling around. But they were, of course, much smaller than the one he’d given her at the time.\n’And the spirits... They’re, on average, level 4. About 20% of them are level 5. There’re about 10,000 of them total. While it may seem like a lot, this is a place where all the spirits on the surface (where they’re abundant) gather, so it’s actually really low. Which means that several of them died or were chased off to the Underground Empire.’\nHe saw a few level 6 spirits as well, but nothing more. Moreover, the higher leveled spirits seemed more mentally scarred, as the higher their level, the clearer their mind was. Sinea looked as though she would cry since she could empathize with them more, being a spirit herself.\n[Paul Zero.]\n\"Yeah, I’m right here.\"\n[You can’t leave my side.]\n\"Yeah, okay.\"\nSinea clung to him even tighter. He looked around the Spirits’ Spring; the mood had become as depressing as a graveyard. Zenon called for Lee Shin Woo, who was astounded by the size of the Spirits’ Spring.\n[Now, let’s talk.]\n\"Are you done testing me now?\"\n[I don’t follow human conventions. I just didn’t know how to deal with someone as powerful as you. A spirit follows you around, despite not being formally contracted to you, and you can even assume a spirit’s form.]\nAs expected, Zenon was extremely straight forward, perhaps because he was spirit. Considering how frank he was, Lee Shin Woo realized how impossible it would be for him to imitate a human being.\n[You first wanted to know about the Spirits’ Spring, right?]\n\"Yeah.\"\nLee Shin Woo followed Zenon and sat down. Sinea clung to his back, and Jin bent his legs and sat down as well. Zenon breathed out some flames into the air and began his story.\n[Apparently, the Spirits’ Spring was created partly as a joke. There are times when a spirit wishes to relax and be free of its contractor, so all the spirits worked together and created a small world that the humans couldn’t enter. It was also used as a shelter for spirits that didn’t have a contractor and were thus in danger, or those who had lost their contractor.]\nHowever, the Spirits’ Spring was meant to be a resting place. The spirits created the Spirits’ Spring through the common human perception of the spirit world and was set up so that spirits could easily find it, while outsiders couldn’t.\nMoreover, the Spirits’ Spring was kept a secret, even from the spirits’ contractors. That’s how this ’secret garden’ was formed.\n[That’s why. The reason why this many spirits were able to survive on that day...]\nElementalists were those chosen by spirits. One could become a magician through training, but being an Elementalist depended on luck and talent, so it was a highly coveted position.\nThe Magic Empire, which was ruled under logic and reason, didn’t welcome their existence. No, it was closer to say that they ’hated’ the spirits. Those emotions were like a ticking time bomb, and when those explosive feelings burst...\n[They waited patiently for their chance. The day we were banished, they declared war on us (spirits and contractors), and voided our rights. They wanted to completely erase the spirits’ existence on the surface.]\n\"Keuk.\"\nAt that moment, the Spirits’ Spring momentarily seethed. The temperature of the ground had instantaneously increased by at least 10 degrees.\nAll the spirits raised their lifeless eyes and stared at Lee Shin Woo. Although he hadn’t gotten any more details, he could feel the images of that day rushing through his head. They were probably memories of all the spirits living in the Spirits’ Spring.\n’A normal person would probably faint from these memories.’\nThat day, the spirits and Elementalists had lost their lives to both magic and the sword. There were those who had been banished underground, as well as those who attempted to escape the surface. There were spirits who lost their contractors and retreated to the Spirits’ Spring, as well as spirits who attempted to escape underground while protecting their contractors.\nThe events of that day occurred hundreds of years ago, yet the surviving spirits remembered it clearly, as though it were just yesterday. This was their eternal punishment for surviving while their contractors had not.\n\"...Then tell me more about the day of your banishment.\"\n[There were two princes with power (magic) that could rival the Emperor. The Crown Prince was weaker than the two, but with the help of the Royal Magician Leader, who hated Elementalists, and the Imperial Army, he managed to banish them underground.]\nOriginally, the Magic Empire had created giant facilities underground and left the monsters that were difficult to handle down there. However, the Crown Prince wanted to trap the 2 Princes and their forces there as well, as they were a threat to his power.\nThis included the Demi-Humans (who weren’t accepted by the Empire), the criminals from various species, the monsters that posed a danger to the Empire, and the spirits and Elementalists. In exchange for all of them gathering together and leaving, they would be allowed to live.\nIt was a success. They resisted fiercely but were eventually chased underground... and were unable to leave.\n\"...Tell me more about how they were trapped.\"\n[It’s a type of prohibition magic. 100 light magicians and 100 dark magicians were gathered, and by sacrificing both their souls and their magic, they created a chaos element magic barrier. A barrier that separated the surface and the underground.] Updates are released by novel⚑fire.net\n\"A chaos element barrier.\"\nHe finally knew what happened. His (non-existent) heart pounded in his chest. Yeah. He already knew about the barrier.\nThe Underground Empire hadn’t fallen due to the presence of the undead. Rather, the barrier had already existed when they were banished underground!\n[It’s as you think. It’s a barrier that doesn’t allow any living beings from escaping.]\n\"...Huh?\"\nIt was Jin, not Lee Shin Woo who asked. Jin’s goblin fire looked slightly forlorn.\n\"It stops all living beings from escaping... Not the other way around?\"\n\"He just told us. The two princes’ forces were banished underground before the undead curse even existed.\"\n\"Then... Huh?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nDid he finally figure it out? Jin’s goblin fire curled up. Lee Shin Woo marveled at how well he could express himself with his goblin fire alone and was now sure... and said what was on his mind.\n\"The Emperor wasn’t seeking immortality. ...He just wanted to get through the barrier and return to the surface.\"\nJissehanu, the Undead Emperor, hadn’t failed.\nHe had succeeded.\nThat’s how they had all become undead.",

    "content": "<Chapter 39. New Party Member - 8 [End of Volume 9]>\n\"How stupid.\"\nJin, who’d learned the truth, said and went silent. He probably had so much on his mind that he couldn’t say anything more. Lee Shin Woo also had mixed feelings on the subject, so he didn’t say anything either. Soon, Jin spoke, as if he were muttering.\n\"If the Emperor’s true goal was turning them into the undead and he succeeded, then... Why are we fighting them? Did even God abandon them?\"\n\"No, it’s to protect the world. If the undead curse spreads to the surface, then the world is as good as dead.\"\nSince Lee Shin Woo was undead himself, he didn’t want to label them like this. But strictly speaking, the undead consumed the world’s resources, without creating anything in return.\nThat was their biggest flaw. If all the beings that lived on this world became undead, then the only course the world could take is ruin. It was only natural that God sought to eliminate the Undead Empire’s curse.\n\"But the Undead Empire’s so pitiful.\"\n\"The hell are you talking about? Everyone’s trying their hardest to live. What are you going to do, let the underground inhabitants go to the surface? If you do that, then the underground and the surface will go to war. It’s been so long since the underground was isolated from the surface. Even if the underground takes their revenge on the surface, the surface dwellers will be the only ones who’ll suffer.\"\n\"Then why do you look so unwell? You don’t sympathize with the underground citizens, nor do you hate the surface dwellers, so why...\"\n\"I feel bad for the heroes.\"\n\"Huh...?\"\nAs expected, Jin hadn’t gotten that far yet. Jin looked bewildered and Lee Shin Woo explained kindly.\n\"The heroes don’t know anything and are being manipulated by God. They don’t know what happened to the people underground, why they became undead, or how the surface is faring. That’s pitiful enough, but even if they eliminate the undead curse, all that’s left for them is despair.\"\n\"Why despair... Ah!\"\nJin realized belatedly and was shocked.\n\"The barrier that prevents the living from passing through... I see! So the heroes can’t leave the Underground Empire either!\"\n\"Yeah. God’s using the heroes to do her dirty work, but once they’ve eliminated the curse, she plans on burying them underground.\"\n\"How could she... Wait a sec. What if they collect 100 permits; if they get that many, they can see the surface. Wasn’t her intent to let them escape to the surface?\"\n\"No, absolutely not.\"\nGod’s power seemed absolute, but Lee Shin Woo knew that God, and by extension, Pleine, were just bluffing.\n\"You’ve never thought about why we’re the only ones given the mission of collecting the secret shop permits? Even though there were dozens of heroes (seniors) before us.\"\n\"Just us... Isn’t it because, other than you, it’s impossible to gather that many permits?\"\n\"No. It’d be really tough, but it’s not undoable. You can also get quests from God. If God had told our seniors that they could go the surface if they gathered 100 permits, then they probably would have tried.\"\nHowever, God had never given them that option. She had only given that option to Lee Shin Woo by surreptitiously saying ’save the permits’. Why did she do that? Lee Shin Woo realized why she’d done that early on.\n\"If the other heroes were to gather 100 permits, it’d be meaningless.\"\n\"Meaningless... What are you talking about?\"\n\"There were several clues. Lee Man Bok hated God, and Pleine showed some signs as well.\"\nAh, and now that he thought about it, he’d heard it before he had brought Jin to the secret shop to leave for the surface. Lee Shin Woo remembered that time and kindly told Jin what Pleine had told him.\n\"She said if it were just me and you, it should be possible, but she also said I’d be the ’first and the last’. Why would I be the last? That’s because the other heroes can’t pass through the gate.\"\n\"Ah...!?\"\nThat’s right. Pleine had borrowed God’s power to create a gate that led to the surface, and while that gate looked like it could be used by the other heroes, it actually couldn’t.\nAlthough she seemed omnipotent, even God couldn’t do anything about the barrier that divided the surface and the underground. So it made sense that Lee Shin Woo and Jin, who ’weren’t alive’, could use the gate. Looks can be deceiving. Rem also wasn’t alive, so it could go through without any problems.\nIt made sense that the other heroes hadn’t heard of gathering 100 permits in order to go to the surface before. No matter how many permits they saved, God didn’t have a way of sending them to the surface!\n\"But the Bone Gate absorbed God’s power and evolved into a level 9 artifact. It blew God’s expectations out of the water and possessed power greater than that of the chaos element barrier. God probably wanted us to do something about the barrier from the surface, but the problem had already been solved. So, there wouldn’t have been any problem if we went straight back underground when we first arrived on the surface.\"\n\"It sounds really stupid.\"\n\"Yeah. It does sound stupid, even while I’m saying it.\"\nOf course, the fact that Lee Shin Woo’s Heaven Door’s Key could transport Ye Jin Jin to the surface was enough proof.\nHowever, that was merely the outcome. The fact that the Heaven Door’s Key had even been born was strictly luck. Its creation hadn’t been God’s intention, but a result of Lee Shin Woo’s karma. It wouldn’t have even been enough if all the heroes traveled around the Underground Empire and went on a ’three steps, one bow’ [1] pilgrimage to Lee Shin Woo.\n\"If we put everything together, we find that... God’s a bitch.\"\n\"Uh, yeah.\"\nLee Shin Woo was flustered by Jin’s extreme bluntness and agreed with him. Although it wasn’t his intention, he ended up defending her a little bit.\n\"But I feel like God wasn’t pleased with her choices either. Whether she decided that things couldn’t go on as they were, or that she pitied the heroes... It doesn’t matter. After all, she turned you and me into the undead.\"\n\"Did she make it so that we could go to the surface after we’ve completed our mission? Sure. But we’re undead! Moreover, it doesn’t change the fact that the other heroes can’t escape!\"\n\"Yeah, so she didn’t have a clear goal or plan in place. She probably just... hoped? We’re both heroes and also entities that can enter the outside world; she was hoping that we would do something about that barrier.\"\n\"She should’ve been more clear!\"\n\"Well, we did deal with it though.\"\nFrom the very beginning, Lee Shin Woo didn’t think God was looking far into the future. As he said, she probably just hoped they’d deal with it; that’s why they were in this situation.\nAnd realistically speaking, they had dealt with it. Lee Shin Woo thought ’you sure are lucky that it turned out as you wanted’. If he just dealt with the undead curse, then everything would be... Lee Shin Woo knew that that was probably what God was thinking, and it had played exactly as she wanted.\n\"So she put us into this situation because of some unclear expectations...\"\n\"It’s not like I don’t sympathize with her at all though. Whatever the rule that’s imposed on her, God definitely can’t directly influence the world. And it’s true that this world is really suffocating.\"\n\"I still can’t forgive her. I want to beat the crap out of her.\"\n\"I don’t plan on forgiving that damn woman either.\"\nLee Shin Woo smiled bitterly, and Jin asked him a question as if he’d just thought of something.\n\"But you said that living beings couldn’t go to the surface, even with God’s power. Then how did Pleine go to the surface?\"\n\"You know that Pleine possesses an extraordinary power, right?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Isn’t it the same reason that she can’t directly intervene with matters regarding the Underground Empire?\"\n\"Ah!\" The source of this content ɪs novel⁂fire.net\nIf Pleine were here, then she’d say something along the lines of ’stop being a hero, lay down a mat, and watch the store for me.’. Jin immediately agreed with his easy to understand explanation.\n\"In other words, Pleine is also...\"\n\"Yeah. She’s either a god herself or a being like one. That’s what I think. If I had to call her something, then... I’d call her an angel.\"\n\"An angel? That really doesn’t fit her.\"\nPleine was Seira’s older sister but was also a human at the time of the Empire’s demise. At the time, something had happened that allowed her to keep her appearance. Even so, it was quite laughable. There was one brother and two sisters (Seagald, Seira, and Pleine), yet one of them was an angel, another was a hero, and the last one was an undead.\n’Pleine must not know what to think. Since her brother and her sister have been reduced to that...’\nThen, Lee Shin Woo felt really curious. Pleine obviously knew, but did Retadane know the real reason as to why the Emperor had created the undead curse?\nIf he just took into account her desire to eliminate all the undead, then it might seem like she didn’t know, but there was still a chance that she knew, yet she acted like that anyway. If it’s the latter, then he had to recognize how strong willed she was.\n[Paul Zero, are you ok?]\n\"Yeah. I feel great since you led me here.\"\n[Mm. I actually have a lot on my mind...]\n\"Don’t worry. I’ll protect you no matter what.\"\n[...Yeah. I trust you, Paul Zero!]\nNow that he thought about it, there was another puzzle he’d solved. There was an order that every golem in the Magic Empire’s golem network shared that was to be their top priority: ’spirits - search and destroy’. Of course, once he’d discovered it, he discreetly canceled that order.\nWhen he’d first discovered the order, Lee Shin Woo wondered why the Empire was going out of its way to look for and eliminate spirits. But it made sense if the Magic Empire always hated the spirits.\nIt wasn’t enough that they slaughtered and chased out the spirits, they were still actively trying to find and eliminate spirits. He was speechless. Perhaps that was why the golems were so spread out across the Magic Empire... Wait a sec.\n\"Wait... Golems?\"\n\"Shin Woo?\"\nAt that moment, a light bulb went off in Lee Shin Woo’s head. It was just a hypothesis, but when he combined everything he’d experienced and the memories he’d acquired from the golems, then everything made sense.\n\"The living can’t go through the barrier.\"\n\"Yeah, so what?\"\n\"...But the golems can go through. Since they’re not living.\"\n\"Yeah, that’s why Pleine said it was ok when you asked if you could bring Rem along.\"\nThe magic engineering involved in controlling golems was advanced on the surface. It was probably much greater than that of the Underground Empire’s.\nAnd one day, one of the Underground Empire’s 12 generals, Arema Steelworker, appeared out of nowhere, and greatly advanced their golem manufacturing technique.\n\"Arema Steelworker... He didn’t betray the Emperor.\"\n\"Why are you suddenly talking about him? Wait a sec, a golem?\"\n\"Yeah. Arema Steelworker’s a golem. He was probably a golem the moment he showed up in the Underground Empire. He coaxed the (Undead) Emperor, who wanted to leave, to help him develop golems, but he actually took full control over the golems...\"\nAll the information he’d acquired on Arema Steelworker fell into place. Everything he’d done in the past, which he couldn’t understand before, made sense when he took into account the circumstances on the surface.\n\"He’s a spy that came from the surface. Perhaps he was sent to watch over, or even kill the (Undead) Emperor... He didn’t betray the Emperor, he was always his enemy.\"\nHe voluntarily placed his soul into a golem and entered the Underground Empire. Why? So that he could leave when he’d completed his mission! And he fooled the Emperor, who was studying golems so that he could pass through the barrier, and increased the size of his forces. Did he not get good results from his research into placing souls into golems? It’s not that he couldn’t, it’s that he didn’t!\nAnd even now, he received orders from the surface and was staying underground. Arema Steelworker’s true purpose wasn’t to live quietly or to annihilate the undead. He was watching the Undead Emperor, and making sure that they couldn’t leave the underground.\n\"Wait a sec. Then... This might get interesting.\"\n\"Uwah, Shin Woo, your expression’s turned really evil... Turn back into an expressionless skeleton. Hey, turn back.\"\nLee Shin Woo completely ignored Jin, summoned Rem, and gave him an order.\nFive minutes later, Lee Shin Woo got his answer, and thought ’I won’.\n[1] E/N: An example of a 3 step 1 bow ceremony.",

If there’s something I want, then it’s for you to care for and not discard that lady.]\n\"Hmm.\"\nThose words were unnecessary. There’s no way he’d treat Sinea, who had unlimited affection for him, unkindly. Their relationship wasn’t the issue right now, but Zenon himself. Lee Shin Woo asked with a more forceful tone than before.\n\"You don’t want anything else?\"\n[Mm...]\nHe could’ve done as he asked since Zenon had given him such valuable information, but... this and that were separate issues. His instincts as a Joker wouldn’t allow Zenon to leave the stage like this.\n\"There should be something you want, Zenon.\"\nThen, he had to go for it. He would push Zenon in the direction he wanted him to go!\n[Don’t mock me. I’d rather not bare my fangs at guests.]\n\"Haha, what a joke. Your fangs are already worn, no?\"\nZenon, who’d weakened from lacking a contractor, likely felt vicarious satisfaction from witnessing Sinea and Lee Shin Woo. But was that all? Would the fury from losing one’s contractor truly fade into lethargy after several hundred years?\n[What did you say?]\n\"If they weren’t, then there’s no way that the ones who killed your contractors would be living so peacefully outside.\"\n[...You!]\nNo way. When one loses a loved one, their anger may pass for a short time, but it would never fade completely. The reason Zenon and the rest of the spirits here were so lethargic was because they didn’t have enough wood to feed the fire. Their anger would reignite with just a little more fuel.\n\"While you guys toiled away in here, unable to either live or die, the humans on the surface have lived peacefully, bore children, and advanced their civilization. Yeah. They live truly shamelessly, the humans who killed the ones you love.\"\n[Enough, Dryad Contractor. Stop with the pointless provocations. By staying here...]\n\"Do you know? Even now, the Emperor has spread golems all across the Empire and has ordered them to catch and kill any newly born spirits. If you don’t believe me, then I can catch one for you and show it to you.\"\n[Shut up!]\nZenon couldn’t put up with Lee Shin Woo, who ignored his warning and said whatever he pleased and spewed flames. However, Lee Shin Woo blocked his attack by just drawing the greatsword strapped onto his back.\nAlthough Zenon had lost his contractor, he was still a level 7 spirit. But Lee Shin Woo had blocked it with one simple move!\n[Impossible!?]\n\"I looked through all the memories you’ve all shown me. They were so clear that it felt like it happened only yesterday. But... do you think the humans who tried to eliminate you remember you? Would you even be able to recognize those they so cruelly trampled upon, be they spirits or their contractors? What do you think?\"\n[You went too far, Human!]\nThen, the Spirits’ Spring seethed once more. It wasn’t just Zenon. The scattered spirits radiated light and surrounded Lee Shin Woo and his party.\n[Don’t.]\n[Don’t say it.]\n[Human!]\nHe wanted to say that they were full of vigor now, but their eyes didn’t show such pure energy. Their suppressed hatred and resentment were forcing their bodies to move. Lee Shin Woo looked around, witnessing their encirclement; tens turned into hundreds, and the hundreds into thousands. Then, he laughed fearlessly.\n\"You’re too scared to fight your enemies, yet you bare your fangs at me, someone who’s trying to help you. Haha, you’re just rats who’ve escaped a battlefield once before. No matter how many of you gather, you can’t beat a tiger.\"\n[I said, shut up!]\nZenon squeezed out every inch of his magic and the other spirits followed suit, focusing all their magic onto Lee Shin Woo. Sinea was ready and quickly formed a wall of wood, but she couldn’t stop thousands of spirits all by herself.\n[Kyaa!]\n\"It’s alright, Sinea. Thanks.\"\nThe wall crumbled instantly, and the concentrated spell, comprised of various elements, annihilated Lee Shin Woo and his party... or so it seemed.\n[...He’s not dead?]\n[He’s absorbing our magic.]\n[He’s not human.]\n[How is he...!?]\n\"Hoo.\"\nLee Shin Woo stepped forward so that his party would remain unharmed, and drew all the spirits’ magic to himself.\nFirst, he activated all of the elemental resistances he’d trained thus far; he could block the majority of the damage with his resistances. Then, he used his level 8 Absorption skill to take care of the rest.\nSince Zenon was level 7, despite being weakened, Lee Shin Woo hadn’t been able to fully absorb his attack and was forced to use his greatsword to defend himself. But even after receiving thousands of attacks from the spirits, Lee Shin Woo’s body... No, even his armor wasn’t damaged in the least. Even if they kept attacking him, the result would be the same. He was the worst opponent they could’ve faced.\n\"As I thought, you really are too weak. You can’t even consider taking revenge if you’re this weak. Of course you’d turn tail and run. You’ve hunkered down for dozens of years... Ah, it’s actually hundreds of years, isn’t it?\"\n[You bastarrrrrd!]\nLee Shin Woo picked and chose the words that stung most and Zenon, unable to put up with him, attacked physically this time! However, there’s no way Lee Shin Woo would lose to a spirit, which had sat rotting for hundreds of years when he possessed such high rank combat skills.\n\"Ha.\"\n[Kueok!?]\nFundamentally, a spirit’s body was quite fast. Moreover, they were in a world created by the spirits! The salamander’s charge was both powerful and quick, like lava shooting out of a volcano. However, Lee Shin Woo moved his body with ease and avoided him, as though he knew how he’d attack beforehand.\nImmediately after, he raised his greatsword as high as possible. Zenon was left wide open from his charge, so Lee Shin Woo hit his waist and pushed him onto the floor. Lee Shin Woo had completely overpowered Zenon with a simple maneuver.\n\"Feel better now? Or do you want some more?\"\n[Keuk...]\n\"Yeah, you must be really angry. I know.\"\n[What would you know...!]\nOnce Zenon realized that he was outmatched, his voice became weak. It seemed as though the other spirits were shocked by Lee Shin Woo’s overwhelming strength, as they shrank away like Zenon.\nHow pathetic. He thought of their full-on attack as an injured baby throwing a fit; with that in mind, he was tormented by a (nonexistent) conscience when he thought about doing as he pleased with them. But since he didn’t have a conscience, the feeling went away soon after.\n\"No, I know. You said it yourself. That all the spirits here are from that day. So it’s only natural that you still feel the anger you felt that day. I get it. More importantly, your question’s odd. You were desperately trying to pass it on so I could understand. Am I wrong?\"\n[Keuk, Heueuk...]\n...Ah, he’s starting to cry! He really is a big baby! Lee Shin Woo wondered whether he should press on or console him, but then, the other spirits also began to cry and Lee Shin Woo’s heart stiffened.\nThere was no point in tormenting them any further. If he did, they’d just get more depressed and he wouldn’t be able to talk to them anymore. Now was the best time to ’prove’ how sincere he was.\n\"Zenon, neither the Crown Prince nor the magicians trying to kill you are here. You can be honest with me.\"\n[...Even if I am honest, there’s nothing I can do. You can’t do anything, so what can we do?]\n\"You’re right. You guys are so weak that you can’t do anything on your own. I guess you could pop some popcorn and watch the Magic Empire from your corner.\"\n[Then what about you!?]\n\"However.\"\nIt was time.\n\"I can give you a chance.\"\nTo sell some medicine.\n[What’s a single human going to do?] Read full story at novęlfire.net\n\"I’m a human who stopped an attack from thousands of spirits. I’m also able to transform into a spirit, and honestly, I haven’t been a human for a long time. I showed you plenty, right? Now, if you get it, then let’s start over.\"\nMedicine too dangerous for children to ingest.\n[...Even if we assume you are that powerful, it’s still too much for us. As you said, we weren’t able to protect our contractors; we’re just losers who only care about our survival. Even though hundreds of years have passed, we’re still trapped in that day!]\n\"But you want to take your revenge, right?\"\n[Eut.]\nOnce ingested, they wouldn’t be able to go back to how they were; a medicine filled with lies.\n\"You want to pay them back, right? You want to give those humans, who made you suffer, their just desserts, don’t you?\"\n[...]\n\"Say it.\"\n[...Yeah.]\nGulp.\nHe heard the sound of Zenon drinking it.\n[I want to take revenge.]\n[I want to kill those humans.]\n[I want to take revenge for my beloved contractor!]\n[I want them to feel what we feel...!]\n[I want them to suffer eternally!]\nIt wasn’t just Zenon. He heard the other spirits’ weak voices too. At first, they were half-hearted, but they gradually got louder and louder. So much so that the spirits’ voices resounded throughout the Spirits’ Spring.\n[I want to kill them all!]\n[I want revenge! On all humans!]\n[I hate everyone who stole our happiness away from us and then shamelessly enjoyed the world as their own!]\n[I want them to feel all my pain. No, even more than that!]\n[Revenge... I want revenge...!]\nMm, what honest and good kids they are. A thin smile appeared on Lee Shin Woo’s face. Jin thought ’here he goes again’ and sighed, while Sinea couldn’t help but feel her heart pounding at the sight of Lee Shin Woo overpowering thousands of spirits.\n\"Now, tell me again. What do you want, Zenon?\"\n[I... No, we...]\nLee Shin Woo asked, and this time, Zenon’s voice didn’t waver.\n[We want revenge on the humans that made us suffer!]\n\"Good. I’ll help you. We’ve established a contract.\"\nOnce Lee Shin Woo uttered those words...\nThe Spirits’ Spring began to light up.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 40 part2",
    "content": "<Chapter 40. Fake Hero Saga - 2>\n\"Mm.\"\nLee Shin Woo saw the Spirits’ Spring begin to radiate light, and groaned. In his head, he thought ’Now I’ve done it!’.\nHis plan had been to get the spirits to follow his every whim and turn the spirits into an assault force through the covert use of the Spirits’ Spring and the Spirits’ Road. Since he thought that was his only option of upholding their request to attain revenge against the Emperor whilst still keeping them safe.\nHowever...\n[The Spirits’ Spring and all of its spirits have agreed to form a contract with you.]\n[The Spirits’ Spring has contracted with you as a subordinate.]\nSweat gathered on his forehead. Oh right. He was disguised as a human right now, so his body mimicked human physiological phenomenon. When he wanted to maintain a complete poker face, he should abstain from disguising himself as a human... No wait, now wasn’t the time to begin escaping reality!\n\"What’s going on?\"\n\"How would I know?\"\n[The Spirits’ Spring... the will of all the past spirits is responding to the contractor. How can this be... I thought they were exhausted and in a deep sleep.]\nZenon barely stood upright and said; his eyes brimmed with tears, touched by the sight. Lee Shin Woo could ever so slightly understand what was going on.\nThe Spirits’ Spring was a space created through the combination of all spirits. It was apt to call it a living world. He was talking with the spirits here, but the Spirits’ Spring itself had also responded to his words and had accepted his offer. It had decided that Lee Shin Woo would save the weakened and lethargic spirits, and had left everything here to him!\n[Ah, aaaah.]\n[It’s warm. This feeling... it’s been a long time.]\n[The spring is embracing us. Thanks... Sorry for how I’ve been.]\nThe light the Spirits’ Spring emitted reached its peak and enveloped both Lee Shin Woo and the spirits. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo felt as though his magic, as well as all the spirits’ magic, had been fused together. No, he soon realized that it wasn’t a mere feeling or illusion based on what came next.\n[The Spirits’ Spring has completely subordinated itself to you. When using the Heaven Door’s Key to create a gate to the Spirits’ Spring, the amount of necessary bones and magic is reduced significantly and the amount of people you can bring along is increased significantly as well. All stats have increased by 10.]\n[By making the Spirits’ Spring your subordinate, all elements and resistances grow significantly.]\n[High Rank Fire, High Rank Lightning, and High Rank Darkness have become Lv5. High Rank Acid has become Lv4. High Rank Wind and High Rank Earth have become Lv3. Intermediate Ice has become Lv10 and evolves to the high rank level. The Absorption skill has become Lv9. Magic has increased by 250.]\n[You have learned the High Rank Water element. Magic has increased by 100.]\n[High Rank Fire Resistance, High Rank Lightning Resistance, and High Rank Acid Resistance have become Lv4. High Rank Wind Resistance and High Rank Earth Resistance have become Lv3. Intermediate Ice Resistance has become Lv10 and evolves to the high rank level. Magic has increased by 200.]\n[You have learned High Rank Water Resistance Lv1. Magic has increased by 100.]\n\"Ooooh...\"\nHe’d gone through various experiences thus far, but the change was so severe that he couldn’t help but groan. His elements and resistances simultaneously leveled up, and as a result, his magic stat increased immensely. There’s no way he could remain calm.\n’My other stats went up too, but my magic went up by 660 all at once... What the hell!?’\nIf Jin had experienced this instead, he would’ve fallen to the floor and rolled around the Spirits’ Spring a hundred times. Pain always accompanied growth, especially when one’s magic increased by at least 15%; the accompanying pain would be quite intense.\n\"Hey, you ok...?\"\n\"Leave me alone for just 10 minutes...!\"\nHe hadn’t noticed since he was busy groaning in pain, but Lee Shin Woo wasn’t the only one to change. The spirits of the Spirits’ Spring had become subordinate to Lee Shin Woo as well and were influenced by the Spirits’ Spring; the spirits began to awaken.\n[Kuhaaaaaah!]\n[Aaaaaaah!]\nThere was a vast difference in strength between a spirit with and a spirit without a contractor. They were entities composed of mana and a soul, so without a medium (a contractor), they found it difficult to influence the physical world. The spirits, who had lost their contractors, had anchored themselves to the Spirits’ Spring, which was why they were pretty much immobile.\nBut because Lee Shin Woo had formed a contract with the Spirits’ Spring, and by extension all the spirits within it, they were now capable of moving forward. They had regained their minds, which had become hazy over time and thus, they, who were entirely composed of mana and souls, became stronger as well.\n[How is this possible?]\n[My body is growing...!]\n[I’m overflowing... with power...]\nThat wasn’t all. The mana that had accumulated within the Spirits’ Spring was released, strengthening the power of the spirits, and in the process, the level 4 spirits leveled up to level 5.\nThe level 5s, who had been close to level 6, leveled up, and Zenon (level 7), as well as the original level 6s saw both the growth and strengthening of their magic.\nTheir combat ability couldn’t even be compared to before.\nIf they attacked him altogether now, they could possibly kill him. Of course, they no longer had any reason for doing so.\n[I’m ready to proceed.]\n[It’s as the human said. He gave us more power.]\n[Even the Spirits’ Spring, which protected us... I see, we should’ve made up our minds earlier.]\n[We thought to ourselves that it was over. Even though it hadn’t even started yet.]\nThe spirits had become stronger and they had regained their intellect as well. They made some valid points, but he wouldn’t last if he had to address each and every one of them.\nLee Shin Woo focused on getting his newly acquired magic under control using his Rule of Bone and Magic Acceleration skills. He’d experienced rapid growth in the past, so it wasn’t as difficult as he expected.\n[The High Rank Mana Bone skill has become Lv5. Magic has increased by 30. You have a deeper understanding of mana and bones, and you are now ready to study the essence of mana.]\n[The Mana Acceleration skill has become Lv5. Magic has increased by 10.]\nHe’d gone through such a mess, so it was only natural that his skills would level up. As his skills leveled up, Lee Shin Woo got his new increased mana under his control. After that, he raised his head and he saw Sinea approaching him with a sulky expression.\n[Paul Zero, you...]\n\"...Ah.\"\nOnce he saw her heart-broken expression, he realized that he’d made a mistake. Of course, it wasn’t his intention, but he’d ignored Sinea, who’d been with him for such a long time, and had instead formed a contract with the Spirits’ Sprint and its accompanying spirits!\nObjectively speaking, he was the bad guy here, since Sinea was the one who led him here in the first place!\n\"Sinea... Do you want to form a formal contract with me too?\"\n[You’re late, you idiot!]\nShe had become so refined after awakening as a Dryad Princess, but right now, she acted like a little kid. He quite liked that, but if he spoke honestly, all that remained for him was ruin...!\nFor 5 minutes after, Lee Shin Woo tried to sweet-talk Sinea into forming an official contract with him, as she was his ’first’; although he’d formed a contract with the Spirits’ Spring, he hadn’t formed an individual contract with each and every spirit. His coaxing didn’t seem to go anywhere, but in the end, Sinea calmed down.\n[You have formed a contract with the Lv7 Elder Dryad Princess Sinea. The contracted spirit’s element has become more powerful, and you can transfer your power to the spirit as well.]\n[Your understanding of souls has deepened. You have acquired the special passive skill, ’Soul Seeing Eye.’ All stats have increased by 5. You can understand souls, and the higher the skill’s level, the deeper your understanding becomes.]\nNo way. He thought it was made up, but something happened aside from his contract with the Spirits’ Spring! The contract with a spirit was in no way normal, but the special passive skill he’d gained along with it was extraordinary, no matter how he looked at it!\n’Does everyone who becomes an Elementalist get this skill? No, there’s no way. Since skills are only given to talented individuals...’\nIn the past, when Lee Shin Woo had encountered the Archmage Lich, he knew that the Archmage’s life force didn’t exist within his body. Of course, at the time, he thought of it as his ’life force’, but now he knew for sure that what wasn’t there was his soul.\nPerhaps he had an ability that allowed him to separate his soul from his body. The skill Lee Shin Woo had gained from the contract had enlightened him of this possibility.\nIn any case, Soul Seeing Eye allowed him to more clearly perceive spirits. Perhaps he’d be able to strengthen the spirits even further if he leveled up this skill. The Dryads had called him an Elementalist in the past, but he had actually become a genuine Elementalist now.\n’It’s not very special. It’s just another one of the Joker’s roles.’\nHe checked his skill once more and nodded his head. Lee Shin Woo could feel all the spirits watching him.\n\"Alright, it seems like you’re all ready to go.\"\n[Yeah. We’re ready.]\n[You told us you’d help us with our revenge.]\n[So what do we need to do? We have no idea what to do.]\n[Tell us what we need to do.]\nWas it because he’d formed a contract with the Spirits’ Spring? He instinctively knew what the spirits wanted and what they were trying to tell him. Lee Shin Woo looked at them and spoke firmly.\n\"We obviously can’t fight them head-on. We need more time to prepare. Do you understand?\"\n[Yeah.]\nZenon, the representative of the spirits, replied firmly. Was it because he had the deepest connection with Lee Shin Woo amongst them? Lee Shin Woo could feel the strong link between them, second only to his connection with Sinea. He decided to recognize Zenon as the representative of the Spirits’ Spring from now on and continued.\n\"I plan on using the Spirits’ Spring as a moving fortress. You can enter the Spirits’ Spring through the Spirits’ Road wherever you are. Conversely, you can follow me and go someplace else through the Spirits’ Road as well. If we take advantage of this ability, then we can quickly attack whomever we want with minimal risk, and also get out without anyone noticing. If we use my gate, then we can shorten that process too.\"\n[I understand.]\n\"I’ll pick the right situation, place, and time. In other words, I’ll be setting the stage for you.\"\n[I understand that too... Thanks.]\nWhenever Zenon nodded his head, the spirits followed suit and nodded, which was adorable. Lee Shin Woo grinned and went to the main topic.\n\"However, there’s something you need to take care of before that. The newly born spirits.\"\n[...Eut.] Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on novęlfire.net\nHe’d said this once before, but it must’ve been a sore spot. Zenon widened his eyes.\n\"The Emperor has tens of thousands, no, hundreds of thousands of golems searching for naturally born spirits. The spirits are then captured and killed. Of course, I’m stopping them right now, but... you should know. That there’s little chance of a neglected spirit growing safely.\"\n[Mm.]\n\"So find those spirits and bring them here. I’ll tell you where they are through my link with the golem network. Revenge is just part of the process; your ultimate goal is to live happily with the other spirits.\"\n[...]\nHe’d scared them and fueled their rage before (the stick), so now it was time for the carrot. It was, of course, quite effective. Lee Shin Woo made himself sound concerned for the newly born spirits, so some of the spirits sniffled.\n[Then... Thanks. I didn’t think that far. But to think, you were worried about the other spirits... As a spirit, I’m ashamed.]\n\"You were overwhelmed by your emotions, so there’s no helping it. But I just wanted to warn you that you can’t just let your rage fuel you.\"\nLee Shin Woo was the one who’d incited their rage and caused them to awaken, yet he still said something so shameless. However, the spirits were already in the palm of his hand! They were touched, and when he saw them floundering around, he inwardly muttered.\n’I really like spirits. They’re so easy to manipulate.’",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 40 part3",
    "content": "<Chapter 40. Fake Hero Saga - 3>\nHe’d acquired an army of 10,000 spirits in an unexpected place! Moreover, he’d also obtained a crucial springboard to conquering the surface. Funnily enough, none of this had come about due to his extensive planning, but due to him bringing Sinea with him without really thinking.\n\"You really don’t know what’ll happen in life.\"\n\"It’s really moving hearing that from you.\"\nJin replied teasingly. So many good things had happened, yet Jin didn’t seem very happy. The reason was quite simple.\nSinea had approached Lee Shin Woo quite aggressively, but once he’d formed an official contract with her, she was so happy that she clung onto him like a girl who’d been in a relationship for 2 weeks.\n[Hoo. Hoo. Paul Zero.]\n\"We’ve already formed a contract; do you not need to use my real name?\"\n[An exchange of one’s real name is like a wedding ring, so it’s fine.]\n\"I-Is it...\"\nLee Shin Woo finally understood how she felt about him. Apparently, a formal contract with a spirit is like a wedding ceremony. Even more so when the spirits’ gender is clearly distinguished like the Dryads (the Dryads are all female)!\nShe had been waiting for the time to form an official contract with him, yet Lee Shin Woo had the gall to form a contract with 10,000 other spirits first. So he could understand her pent-up frustration.\n\"Hoo...\"\n[You can stare at me all you want, I’m not going to give Paul Zero to you!]\n\"...\"\nAt this point, Jin actually appreciated that she recognized him as a rival, which was all the more pitiful. That unspeakable misery made Jin think, ’can I score a point now?’, but then, their last remaining party member said.\n[Will this really be ok?]\nThe spirit shaped like a flaming lizard was, of course, the level 7 Elder Salamander Prince Zenon. Lee Shin Woo had ordered the other spirits to form teams and find the newly born spirits on the surface, but he had asked Zenon to follow him.\n\"Don’t worry. Even the 12 generals wouldn’t be able to recognize you when you’re hidden within the flames I’ve created.\"\n[No, I’m ok. I’m right beside you, so I won’t be in danger. I’m worried about the other spirits.]\nHe was thankful for the overestimation, but Lee Shin Woo was still level 7. Of course, if he told Zenon that he was level 7, he wouldn’t believe him. Lee Shin Woo’s stats were on the cusp of level 8, he possessed a variety of high rank skills, and his level 11 Rule of Bone skill increased his stats equivalent to a level 8.\n’I’m this strong at level 7, so what’ll happen when I reach level 8...’\nHe was confident that he could take on the level 8 12 generals head-on when he hit level 8. Even if he encountered that Lich again! Lee Shin Woo could manage against the Lich due to the buffs from his Rebellion skill if they were to fight right now. Even from his own point of view, he felt like he didn’t have any weak spots.\n[Do you have a plan?]\n\"A plan? Ah, you mean for the spirits that can go to the surface now. Nope.\"\n[Keut.]\nLee Shin Woo replied irresponsibly and Zenon looked like he was at his wit’s end. When they had formed a contract, Zenon had seemed so confident, but now that the excitement had worn off he seemed fearful again. Lee Shin Woo sighed and said.\n\"Like I said, I’ve taken control of the Emperor’s golem network that orders the golems to search for and kill any spirits they find. For now, no one will find out about the spirits. Of course, there’s no helping the ones who are unluckily found.\"\n[Then that means they’re in danger...!]\n\"So you wanted revenge when you’re not willing to risk anything to get it?\"\n[Keuk...]\nZenon’s weak response caused Lee Shin Woo to sigh once again. How was he such a coward? His attitude didn’t fit his appearance at all.\nOf course, he’d expected this from the very beginning. If coaxing them to fight had been easy, and they had sufficient courage while being willing to charge into danger without hesitation, then they wouldn’t have hidden within the Spirits’ Spring in the first place.\n\"That’s what war is like. Each person risks their life. Moreover, the task I’ve assigned to the spirits is their most important one; it’s for the spirits’ ’future’ and what they’ll do after the battle is over. If they can’t do that, then give up on your revenge.\"\n[...I can’t give up. We all agree on this.]\n\"Good. Don’t forget that feeling.\"\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t planning on leaving the spirits to die. The golem network would help, but he also left some spirits on standby within the Spirits’ Spring; these spirits would act as a ’rescue unit’ and were ready to be deployed whenever necessary.\nIf they were to die, even though he went through all this effort, then there was really no helping it. They were executing their plan in a much safer environment than the Paul Zero Corps, which was going around the Underground Empire and hunting the undead.\n[I’m willing to die for you, Paul Zero. But before then, I’d like to leave behind a child.]\n\"Don’t worry, you’re not going to die.\"\n[Paul Zero...]\nWeren’t Dryads birthed from trees? So if they had another way of leaving behind children, then what was it?\nHe wanted to ask, but at the same time, he was suddenly overwhelmed by a sense of anxiety, so he kept it to himself. Following his official contract with her, Sinea began to look at him more sensuously than before. Perhaps... No, he’d figure that out when they were alone.\n[It’s good to be loved by a spirit. You even got the Spirits’ Spring to respond to you; you truly are an impressive Elementalist.]\n\"Mm, you’ll see that later.\"\nZenon seemed truly awestruck by Lee Shin Woo. On the other hand, Lee Shin Woo just felt bitter, replied, and hurried on his way.\nThey would soon reach the end of the Spirits’ Road. Lee Shin Woo had set it up so that they would arrive outside of the thicket near Kuroa’s Glory. At first, it had taken several hours to get to the Spirits’ Spring, but it only took a few minutes on the way back.\n\"If I can control the exit, then I can go wherever I wish on the surface without the Heaven Door’s Key.\"\n\"You’re too greedy.\"\n\"Greedy? You’d be surprised how much I’m holding back right now. If you knew, you’d be shocked.\"\n\"Y-Yeah...?\"\nJin tilted his head at Lee Shin Woo’s unbelievable response. However, Lee Shin Woo was telling the truth. Although he’d become able to transform into a spirit, and had leveled up his Disguise skill, enabling him to transform into a human, he desperately held back his desires with the thought ’not while Jin’s here’.\nMoreover, he’d even formed a contract with 10,000 spirits and the Spirits’ Spring itself, so a compliment wouldn’t even be enough.\n\"It’s already night. Rest up for now, Jin. Starting tomorrow, you probably won’t have anything to do for two days.\"\n\"Ok. Then call me when you’re free. Let’s play some board games.\"\nWhen he heard the word ’board games’, Lee Shin Woo inwardly smiled bitterly. Board games. As Jin couldn’t sleep or eat, Lee Shin Woo had thought of board games as a way to pass the time. Since he wanted to prove that humans had other methods of relieving stress other than eating or sleeping.\nOf course, there was no way that this world had any proper board games. He referenced some of the board games he’d played on Earth and created them in his spare time, but Jin had reacted a lot better to them than he’d expected. Jin pointed out that his world had board games like this too, but Lee Shin Woo just used the excuse of parallel worlds. It was his ’absolute defense’ skill.\n\"Sure, I can always spare some time for some board games.\"\n\"Ok. Then, see you tomorrow.\"\nHe tied Jin to his normal spot. Jin could clearly see him if he looked through the 1st floor window, but from the 2nd floor, Lee Shin Woo was free from his gaze.\nLee Shin Woo discreetly checked his inventory and inwardly clenched his fist. Ultimately, he triumphantly passed the living room and when he was about to go up to the 2nd floor, someone stopped him. Ye Jin Jin was quietly doing paperwork in the living room.\n\"Ah, Mr. Shin Woo! Welcome back.\"\n\"You weren’t asleep? You’ll be busy tomorrow too.\"\n\"Well, I thought if I finished my work a little quicker, then I would be able to go on a date with you before you go to the capital... Ah, that’s only if you accept, Mr. Shin Woo!\"\n[...Seems like you’re not only loved by spirits.]\nYe Jin Jin replied and her cheeks became flushed. Seeing that, Zenon (he was hiding his existence, so Ye Jin Jin couldn’t hear him) quietly muttered. Lee Shin Woo ignored him and replied.\n\"Don’t sleep too late.\"\n\"Ok! I’ll read just a little bit more and then I’ll go to sleep.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nLee Shin Woo was actually quite surprised by her growth. After their first meeting Ye Jin Jin began to grow rapidly, and when she came to the surface she quickly picked up the shop business. She had so much latent potential that he couldn’t help but say ’as expected of a hero’.\nHe knew what the driving force behind her actions was, so he was a bit concerned, but... He should be able to solve that problem. Why? Because he could turn into a human now! If she’s seeking his affection, then he could give it to her bit by bit.\n’This is nothing compared to my days as a employee, entertaining clients.’\nHe couldn’t even count how many times he’d eaten together with a girl or attended a party in order to close a deal. That wasn’t all. He’d been asked for more more than twice before. When he really hated it, he did anything he could to get out of it.\nBut that was what work life was. You use everything you could get your hands on to succeed, or you keep your pride and chastity... Whichever you choose, you would have to make a choice you didn’t like again and again.\n’How does it compare to back then? She’s a cute girl that’ll do anything I ask of her. This is actually a win-win... It doesn’t even compare to South Korea.’\nIf they knew about the environment he was in, all salarymen would clamor at him to change places with them. He had no plans of switching with them, Lee Shin Woo thought, and raised his head. Lee Shin Woo had already reached his room.\n\"Huh? What about Zenon?\"\n[I told him go away and go to sleep. I don’t have the time to deal with him when you’re by my side, Paul Zero.]\nSinea said coldly, but soon her expression changed. She approached Lee Shin Woo’s side and he realized that she’d found out about his Disguise skill’s upgrade.\n\"When did you find out?\"\n[Paul Zero, you can transform into a spirit too.]\n\"...I see.\"\nHow did he not notice? Lee Shin Woo felt like he was an idiot. If spirits could eat and sleep, then they had reproductive abilities as well. And since Lee Shin Woo had succeeded in transforming into a spirit...\n\"Is that when you decided you had to form a contract with me?\"\n[I decided to form a contract with you before then, but it’s true that the situation was good.]\n\"Is that so... Wait a sec. There was something I wanted to do when I turned back into a human.\"\nLee Shin Woo stopped Sinea, who looked at him like a predator would its prey, and took out a bottle of wine from his inventory. It was the Kerr Century Elemental 451.\n[Oh my. This is the wine we made together. It really fits.] Thɪs chapter is updated by novel⚑fire.net\n\"That wasn’t my intention, but... You want a drink too?\"\n[Yeah.]\nLee Shin Woo brought the wine glass to his lips and felt something. When was the last time he’d drunk wine? It’s definitely been more than a year. Moreover, he’d spent such dark days in the Underground Empire, so it felt like it’d been even longer since his last sip.\n\"...Aah.\"\nBut he could accept it if this was the result of all that hard work. Since good wine was created by proper maturation.\n[It really is delicious.]\n\"Yeah. ...It’s so delicious I feel like I’ll cry.\"\nHe could smell the aroma of the wine with his disguised nose, and the wine travelled down his disguised tongue and passed through his disguised throat. It was then heated up by his disguised stomach. This feeling, which he’d regained, felt like ecstasy.\n[Hoo.]\nThen, Sinea smiled mysteriously and got even closer. It seemed like she wasn’t willing to wait any longer.\nHonestly speaking, he wanted to enjoy the wine a bit longer, but it couldn’t be helped. He shrugged his shoulders and accepted her. The Dryads’ refreshing and sweet aroma invaded his nose.\n’This is also business. ...A win-win, huh. How nice.’\nTwo days later, Lee Shin Woo had completely finished his work as Lawrence and he and his party went on a short trip to the capital.",

    "content": "<Chapter 40. Fake Hero Saga - 4>\n’Haa...’\nJin didn’t seem like he was in a good mood all throughout their trip to the capital. Was it because Lee Shin Woo had made him draw their wagon, so that his cover (as a normal horse) wouldn’t be blown? No, it wasn’t that simple. Jin was definitely dissatisfied with his partner.\nLee Shin Woo was absolutely sure that he hadn’t figured out about his complete human transformation, but he was also reluctant to ask Jin what was wrong, so he just shut his mouth for the time being.\n\"The weather’s great!\"\n[It really is. It’s so clear, as if it’s wishing us happiness in the future. I guess there are some things worth seeing on the surface.]\nWhereas Sinea and Ye Jin Jin couldn’t be happier, sitting opposite to Lee Shin Woo in the wagon. What was he hiding? He was with Sinea on the first day, and Ye Jin Jin on the second... They were so boisterous, so much so that it seemed like they’d go to heaven, due to the ’entertainment’ he’d provided with the date. Lee Shin Woo had asked them to restrain themselves; apparently this was them ’restrained’.\n\"Don’t be so loud.\"\n\"Ok!\"\n[Ok. Hoo. Hoo.]\nThose girls knew, of course, how Jin was feeling; more than Lee Shin Woo anyway. That’s why they tried their very best to not show how happy they were, but there was no way for them to hide the happiness and joy they felt.\nTheir reactions reminded him of his friend when he had first started dating his girlfriend. No, now that he thought about it, they were reacting similarly to his friend.\n\"Mr. Shin Woo, that cloud looks like your eye socket!\"\n[Hoo, no matter how I look at it, it looks more like his sacrum than his eye socket.]\n\"Do you guys always look at my bones so closely on a regular basis...?\"\n’...Keuk.’\nAnd whenever they engaged in more intimate skinship, he could hear Jin’s hit points going down.\n’Be honest. What did you do to them? Did you by any chance...’\n’I told you. They’ve been working hard, so I complimented them a little bit... After that, I guess we had a date. It was a commercial service. A service.’\n’A date is a service...’\nLee Shin Woo could hear Jin’s voice through the Assimilation skill and responded naturally. There was absolutely nothing wrong with his attitude. Of course, Jin didn’t trust him right away, as he’d travelled with this Joker for so long, but... he didn’t have any evidence to pursue it with. So...\n’I’m your partner... You shouldn’t lie to me.’\n’I told you, I’m not lying to you.’\n’Really...?’\nSo Jin stopped his attempts at breaking Lee Shin Woo’s unbreakable mask, and tried to hit at his conscience instead.\n’Of course. You’re my partner. My only partner.’\n’...Your only partner.’\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo didn’t have a conscience, so it was completely ineffective. Unfortunately, Jin didn’t know that, so he decided to accept his explanation.\n’Well, I guess it makes sense, since those girls’ mental state hasn’t been normal since the beginning.’\n’You’re the worst. You looked like you were being friendly to Ye Jin Jin!’\n’This and that are two different things. Yeah, I was being friendly, but she’s still crazy.’\nOf course, just because Jin had accepted his explanation didn’t mean he was completely over it. Since Ye Jin Jin and Sinea were still clinging onto Lee Shin Woo, and he was still drawing the wagon!\n\"It feels kind of lonely since we left. I wanted to stay in Kuroa’s Glory for about ten more days.\"\n\"Our shop doesn’t have any holidays. If you want to take a break, then apply for a vacation. Of course, it’d be unpaid leave.\"\nIn the past, Lee Shin Woo had worked in a vicious enterprise that exploited him, and he was carrying on that tradition for the Lawrence shop. After all, this is how you got rid of bad habits.\n\"I don’t care if I’m not paid, but it’s meaningless if I’m the only one resting. I wanted to go sightseeing with you, Mr. Shin Woo...\"\n[Hoo. Once we get to the capital, Paul Zero will be working hard again. I’d rather time just stopped right now.]\nLee Shin Woo had invested a day into Sinea and a day into Ye Jin Jin, so he couldn’t rest anymore. Of course, he didn’t forget to play board games with Jin in his free time. Honestly speaking, he was more comfortable with Jin than with them (the business targets).\n\"Ah, I can kind of see the capital’s walls. Shin Woo, what are you going to do about the paladins that are following us?\"\n\"They’ll be working on behalf of the Sun God religion, while I’ll be staying at the Lawrence shop, so there’s no reason to go in together. Moreover, if I stay too close to the Sun God religion, then it’ll be hard for people to approach Lawrence to negotiate with Kay.\"\n\"As expected of you, Mr. Shin Woo. To think that far ahead...\"\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t planning on ruining his alliance with the Sun God religion, but he also wasn’t going to avoid the influential individuals in the capital. If he could gain information, assistance, or form personal connections by meeting with them, then he had no reason not to.\n’The Sun God religion had more power than I had initially assumed. Since my name was spread to about half of the Empire by just clearing five dungeons... It goes without saying that my name was spread to Kuroa’s Glory and the adjacent capital. The nobles in the capital might be tense.’\nNormally, an individual recognized as a saint by a religious order isn’t someone often seen. A saint had to possess power that displayed the god’s distinct characteristic, such that everyone in the religious order would acknowledge them. At the same time, they had to have a meek personality that obeyed their orders.\nPlus, Lee Shin Woo had enough power to clear a level 6 dungeon by himself, which had made a strong impression on not only the other religious orders, but the nobles in the capital as well. Furthermore, he was Lawrence’s sponsor, the same Lawrence that had had such a successful auction!\nAccording to a report he’d gotten through the golem network, people were selling books in the capital detailing the peddler Lawrence and the hero Kay’s friendship and successes. With this, he wouldn’t have to worry about people recognizing either Lawrence or Kay. But for some reason, he was a bit concerned about the contents of the book. He would get Ye Jin Jin to buy it for him later and check it for himself.\n’Anyway, my position in the capital will be set once I clear the unconquered level 7 dungeon. I’ll have as much power as a high rank noble, and in a way, an image that surpasses that of a [Hero].’\nIf he wasn’t going to engage in an all-out war with the surface, then he had to take this opportunity to create a foothold in the capital. He had, of course, given Bisher Moon that mission, but there were things one could do in the light that couldn’t be done in the darkness.\n\"B-But you can’t succumb to temptation, even if they offer their daughter to you or something.\" The source of this content ɪs novel·fire.net\n\"Even though the Sun God religion has acknowledged me as a saint, I’m still originally a mercenary. The nobles won’t give up their daughters so easily. But they might send me a prostitute disguised as a young lady of the house or their daughter.\"\n\"You can’t! I’ll take care of all of that!\"\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"\nYe Jin Jin acted so innocent, but said something so bold. Lee Shin Woo stroked her head and grinned. Of course, her concern was unnecessary. If need be, he could dispel his human transformation. With that, all his worldly desires would disappear, and he would become a Sage!\nBeing able to control his sexual desires when speaking with other humans or negotiating with them was a huge advance. One’s base desires would cause one’s judgment to go askew, and it was especially difficult to control oneself when faced with an intelligent and attractive individual.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo was now capable of switching to his ’Sage Mode’ at will, so during a negotiation, he could dominate the other side!\n’In that sense, Bisher Moon was the right choice to move in the shadows... Though he didn’t know just how much he’d accomplished here.’\nHe got his answer 30 minutes later. Once the front gate guards noticed his wagon, their eyes shined and they immediately welcomed him.\n\"Ah, you must be the party of the Sun God’s hero and the Lawrence shop. We’ve been waiting for you. Please, come inside.\"\n\"Your store branch in the capital has been completed. If you’re going that way, then I can take you there myself.\"\n\"...I’d appreciate it.\"\nHe thought that perhaps Bisher Moon had done something to the guards to take advantage of the nobles, but once the lid was open, he found that it was the complete opposite.\nJust in case, he checked the guards’ stats, but there was nothing suspicious about them; they were 100% human. While he was puzzled, one of the guards guiding them approached him and whispered.\n\"Lord Bisher said he’d meet with you in the evening.\"\n\"...Can you tell him I got his message?\"\n\"Of course.\"\nAs he thought, this human was under Bisher Moon’s control! He didn’t know if he commissioned them, or if one of his subordinates had infiltrated the guards, but he was amazing either way!\nAs a regular business employee, Lee Shin Woo didn’t know what Bisher had done to acquire such power in the capital.\n\"Well, I’ll know after I hear it straight from him.\"\n’Perhaps he did stuff like this in the past, before he became a hero,’ Lee Shin Woo thought vaguely. At the end of the road, he could see an indistinct castle.\nIt seemed completely hidden, but he could feel it. The existence of the Emperor within those walls, as well as magic greater than that of the Archmage. At that moment, he was sure of it. He was a lower level than him, but for some reason, he was able to roughly measure him.\n’Level 9.’\nHe’d expected this, but it felt different in person.\nDid the Emperor sense his presence as well? Even if he did, he would probably regard him as the Sun God’s hero. There was also a chance he hadn’t sensed him at all. Lee Shin Woo was confident that his mana control wouldn’t lose to anyone.\n’As I thought, it’d be difficult to face a level 9. Is the Undead Emperor also level 9? He probably is... Ultimately, if I want to achieve my goals, then I need to take those two down.’\nHis magic had increased significantly and he’d collected bones from the level 6 dungeons, which had increased his stats by a little. So, his current stat total was 12,392. He needed a little over 400 stats to reach level 8.\nBut even if he reached level 8, he didn’t think he could defeat the Emperor. Even if he used all his strength, using the Bone Armory, the Thorn Shadow, or even the fully charged level 8 Titan Bone Golem, he didn’t think he would be able to win.\nThat’s just how overwhelming a level 9 was. Just by sensing the Emperor’s existence from afar caused him to instinctively feel tense!\n’So that’s why he’s so confidently emitting his magic. ...He doesn’t know that I’ll use that against him.’\nCould he find his weakness and make use of it with just that exposure of mana?\nYes, indeed. As long as Lee Shin Woo was the one fighting him at least.\n\"Now then, let’s go see the place that Bisher Moon has prepared for us.\"\n\"Ah, Shin Woo’s making that face again. Whenever he makes that face, someone dies...\"\n\"...Mr. Shin Woo, you’re so cool.\"\n[It’s perfect.]\n\"Why do all the girls involved with you have such perverted fetishes? Or does the world have some sort of proclivity towards the name ’Lee Shin Woo’...?\"\n[I-I can feel the Emperor’s mana... Can we go undiscovered? We probably won’t be, but...]\nAnd thus, his party (they were all in the same situation but had different thoughts) successfully entered the capital. They’d gotten in quietly without a hitch, but in the end their presence would be unavoidable... Everyone will know.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 40 part5",
    "content": "<Chapter 40. Fake Hero Saga - 5>\nFirst off, Lee Shin Woo visited the Lawrence shop’s capital branch, checked the interior, and dumped items from his inventory into the storehouse. He was then led to the residence Bisher Moon had acquired for him. Seeing the huge size of the house was an indirect confirmation of Bisher Moon’s success.\nJin complained as he was the only one who couldn’t enter the building, but there was no helping it. Lee Shin Woo once again thought that he needed to hurry up and master the Disguise skill.\n[It’s been a long time, Lord Paul Zero.]\n\"Long time no see. It seems like you’ve exceeded my expectations.\"\n[It’s an honor that you feel that way. I’ve made a list, albeit poorly, of all the forces and goods we’ve acquired, so I’ll present it to you later.]\nAs promised, Bisher Moon met with Lee Shin Woo in the evening; he wore a stylish suit and was refined, so much so that Lee Shin Woo would believe it if he said he were a noble’s butler.\nHe was a handsome man that evoked a cold feeling, with gray hair and reddish-brown eyes. No matter how you looked at him, he looked like a proper human. He didn’t look like an undead at all.\n\"Alright. It’s a relief that you were able to properly transform into a human.\"\n[Yes. I was a bit concerned, as I had never made the attempt after becoming an undead, but...]\nBisher Moon’s original species was the Moon Wolf. They were a race of werewolves who hovered between the boundary of human and wolf. Bisher Moon’s kind were the elites, blessed by the moon more so than any other werewolf tribe. The ’Moon’ title was a dead giveaway; amongst the Moon Wolves, Bisher Moon was equivalent to royalty.\nHowever, he had become undead and degenerated into a mere ghoul. Lee Shin Woo had played on Bisher Moon’s desire for revenge and as a result, Bisher Moon had pledged his loyalty to him and evolved into a completely new species: the Wolf Avenger. He regained his abilities as a Moon Wolf and had even gained the title of Avenger, so if he excluded the fact that he’d turned into an undead, he had become much stronger than before.\n’No, wait. Avengers are undead created only after one has experienced death before and then revived due to their thirst for vengeance... In other words, it seems like a class that only the undead can get.’\nIn any case, Bisher Moon had regained his long lost power as a Moon Wolf, and by subordinating himself to Lee Shin Woo, his darkness magic had become even stronger; this was especially true regarding his original transformation skill. He had been influenced by Lee Shin Woo’s innate abilities and had become noticeably stronger.\nThat’s right. While incomparable with Lee Shin Woo, Bisher Moon could also use his magic to disguise himself as a living being. This was one of the reasons that Lee Shin Woo had picked Bisher Moon to accompany him, despite having so many subordinates to choose from.\n[It’s supposed to be difficult to obtain the ability to disguise an undead’s mana unless you’re a vampire. However, by subordinating myself to you, I was able to obtain that ability. I’m in awe of your abilities, Lord Paul Zero.]\n\"Thanks for the compliment, but you saying that makes me feel kind of tense; I feel like I’ll meet a vampire somewhere down the line.\" ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ novel✶fire.net\n[To tell you the truth...]\n\"Damn it. I knew this would happen...!\"\nWhat he said next was classic. The darkness within the capital would deepen at night, and there was a group that hid inside said darkness. Both Bisher Moon and that group fought against each other to increase their power!\nWith the goods Lee Shin Woo had entrusted to him, as well as his own skills, Bisher Moon was quickly able to increase his power, but by doing so, he had come into contact with the capital’s deepest darkness. With the backing of a Count that resided within the capital, the organization went wild; however, the organization had a huge secret.\n[And I was recently able to figure it out, just barely. A vampire lurks within the ’Red Moon’ faction, the group that opposes our own ’Moon Shadow’.\"\n\"Yeah, I saw that coming. By the way, everyone sure loves the moon.\"\nThe Underground Empire had been filled with things he’d never experienced before, but once he’d come to the surface, he repeatedly experienced things that would happen in any fantasy novel.\nBut a battle between the vampires and the werewolves in this city of the night? Aside from the original, he couldn’t acknowledge or understand it. Moreover, both factions had the word ’moon’ in it! It was a relief that his side only one had werewolf in it.\n\"Don’t waste your time on such a pointless fight and end it already. Want me to help?\"\n[Not only do they have a noble in their group, but information on our group has spread, so it would be difficult to fight them head on. If we attack them half-baked, then we’ll lose our standing in the capital. If we’re going for it, then we have to strike at their core. Perhaps then I’ll ask you for your help, Lord Paul Zero.]\n\"Alright, I got it.\"\nThe Count that Bisher Moon had found was likely under the control of a vampire. The fact that Bisher Moon could easily find information on them meant that there was a key figure in the ’Red Moon’ that used them as shields.\nA giant force that had power over day and night... It probably wasn’t the Emperor, but it had to be someone close, like a high ranking noble.\n’Both sides are really daring. When all the undead were forced into the underground, they weren’t purged and instead have been operating in the capital and raising their forces all this time. Which means...’\nThey were powerful and daring enough to fool even the Emperor. An unexpected competitor had shown up. Knowing this information beforehand would prove indispensable.\n\"Wait a sec. Then, what’s most important is...\"\n[It’s to ensure that they don’t figure out the link between us, Lord Paul Zero. But you don’t have to worry about that. Since I can use darkness magic as well.]\n\"Are you sure you’re up for it?\"\n[Of course. You can count on me.]\n\"Alright. Then I’ll leave it to you.\"\nAfter that, Lee Shin Woo accepted and read Bisher Moon’s report. The report summarized Bisher Moon’s successes, including how many troops he’d gathered and managed, important figures, and an account of their finances.\nWith feats like this, Bisher Moon could raise his head up high. He was surprised that Bisher Moon had gathered so many troops in such a short period of time (less than a month).\n\"300 buildings, with at least a hundred of them in the capital’s main street. As expected, they’re disguised as either shops or inns. Moreover... you won over a noble too?\"\n[My identity wasn’t revealed, but I was able to recruit those who opposed the Red Moon, which is where most of the low ranking nobles gather. In the process, I tried to imitate you, albeit poorly and was somehow able to resolve the issue well. Now they’re completely loyal to the organization (Moon Shadow).]\n\"Unbelievable.\"\nThey say a child learns from their parents. This was a good example of that. Lee Shin Woo didn’t know when Bisher even had the opportunity to watch and learn from him, but this was quite the success!\n\"Good. You’ve done well. Now I don’t have to meet them one by one.\"\n[There were several people I couldn’t persuade. If you just give me a little bit more time, then...]\n\"Leave them to me. I just got a title that might work here.\"\n[As expected of my lord...!]\nLee Shin Woo had originally planned on spreading Lawrence and Kay’s names far and wide, and slowly build his position in the capital, but due to the Sun God religion’s support, his plan had been sped up by a few months.\nAs the hero, Kay, he had cleared unconquered dungeons one after another, ones which had been untouched by mankind, and regained human territory. Plus, he made the Sun God’s light more well known! He was powerful enough that a low rank noble wouldn’t be able to deal with him.\n[You really get along with him (your subordinate)...]\n[If we can deal with the Emperor somehow, then you should be able to seize control over the entire Magic Empire, Lord Paul Zero.]\n\"Why do I have to carry that burden?\"\nLee Shin Woo wanted to live freely, he didn’t want to live for others. It may sound like this was coming out of the blue, as he was now the Heaven Defying general, but managing his subordinates was a real pain in the ass. He imagined managing something as large as the Empire and just sighed.\n\"Being a peddler (Lawrence) is plenty enough for me.\"\n\"Mr. Shin Woo. It’s too late, so please just accept it.\"\nYe Jin Jin laughed and Lee Shin Woo felt his dreams being cut apart. Lee Shin Woo twisted Ye Jin Jin’s nose as punishment (she seemed happy for some reason, but she was a pervert, so it wasn’t all that new) and then gave her his orders.\n\"We’ll officially start up the Lawrence shop tomorrow. The shop’s not well known enough in the capital as of yet. We’ll focus on increasing our power for the time being.\"\n[I acquired a few small shops, so I should be able to help you discreetly, Madam.]\n\"Madam...!\"\nYe Jin Jin blushed and twisted her body around. How did he find out? He hadn’t shown any signs, but Bisher Moon had found out regardless; Lee Shin Woo felt quite uneasy.\n[I figured it out based on the space between you two, the way Ms. Ye Jin Jin looks at you, and various other factors. The spirit you’re traveling with as well... Ah, I’m right.]\n[As... expected of one of Paul Zero’s subordinates.]\n’It sure is a relief that Jin couldn’t come inside,’ Lee Shin Woo suddenly thought and smiled bitterly.\nNo, now wasn’t the time to be engaging in this love comedy. Lee Shin Woo shook his head and asked Bisher Moon.\n\"Bisher Moon, did you get what I asked for through Rem?\"\n[I thought it would be quite difficult to obtain, as it is stored in the heart of the Empire, but... I was somehow able to procure it with Rem’s help. I was shocked when I witnessed Rem’s ability to nullify level 7 golems.]\n\"Yeah. Rem might be the strongest when there’re a lot of golems around. I’ll take over later, so bring it to me personally.]\n[Understood.]\n\"What are you talking about? Was there an item hidden within the capital that you wanted, Mr. Shin Woo?\"\nShe didn’t directly ask if he stole something, but went about it in a roundabout way. In response, Lee Shin Woo smiled meaningfully.\n\"It’s the best loot I’ve gotten from the surface.\"\nOnce he’d carefully looked over Bisher Moon’s report, Lee Shin Woo discussed the direction they’d go from now on (concerning the cooperation between the Lawrence shop and Moon Shadow, or what the hero Kay would be doing), as well as any urgent problems. After that, he told them to break up.\n[Then, I’ll give you my report.]\nNow it was Rem’s turn. He wanted to know how it had acquired the golems without the Emperor’s notice, how the golems were arranged, and how many there were. He’d heard about it on his way here already, but if he reviewed it again, then he’d be able to adjust their future actions.\nOf particular note was the discovery of a few spirits. Golems were placed across the Empire and sought out spirits under the Emperor’s command, so they were able to find spirits faster than anything else. It was important that he let the Spirits’ Spring spirits know so they could take care of it.\n[Of course, I deleted all of the golem’s previous orders, but I cannot force them to act outside of their designated routines. Thus, the spirits must act quickly.]\n\"Let’s ask Sinea for help with that. You don’t need to report each and every matter to me. Just inform the spirits through Sinea.\"\n[Understood. Aside from that, I acquired information from the capital in order of importance...]\nWhile Lee Shin Woo was organizing and analyzing Bisher Moon and Rem’s information, Sinea and Ye Jin Jin were fighting; starting tomorrow, Lee Shin Woo would be busy with his work as Kay, so they were fighting for the right to be with Lee Shin Woo this evening.\n\"With this, I have 4 wins and 3 losses...! I win!\"\n[It’s a deuce. If you lose the next game, then it’s invalid. Hurry up, go on to the next game!]\n\"When did we have such a rule!?\"\nIf they were fighting with pure strength, then Ye Jin Jin would lose instantly, but because they were using the board game Lee Shin Woo had created to determine victory or defeat, they weren’t getting a clear winner or loser. Ultimately, Lee Shin Woo, who’d finished with his work, ended their dispute by promising that he’d bring both of them to his bedroom. Even though he was disguised as a human, his infinite stamina as an undead remained.\n\"Mr. Shin Wooooo.\"\n[Can’t you give me another hug?]\n\"Seriously, do some work. Work!\"\nThat would end Lee Shin Woo’s unpaid leave. Sinea and Ye Jin Jin thought it’d be nice if the night would go on forever, but there was no way their wish would be fulfilled. Lee Shin Woo calmly shook off Sinea and Ye Jin Jin and stood up. He was hit by the rays of the morning sun and equipped his armor once more.\nHe had gotten a report from the Sun God religion; they had procured the level 7 dungeon.",

    "content": "<Chapter 40. Fake Hero Saga - 6>\nIt had been a long time since they’d last met; the Sun God religion’s Pope looked at Kay, who was fully equipped and asked.\n\"I heard that Lawrence has a young, beautiful lover, who’s also business savvy and goes with him everywhere. What about you; you got anyone? I don’t want to take all the credit, but you’ve become more well known because of us.\"\n\"I’m planning on stealing her from him.\"\n\"Don’t do it! If the Sun God’s hero splits from his backer for such a trivial reason, then we’ll lose face!\"\n\"It was a joke. To be honest, I’m not interested.\"\nSince both of them were him, there weren’t any problems, but it seems like the Pope still considered them separate individuals.\nThe situation had changed from what he’d first envisioned, and there wouldn’t be any problems with disclosing the fact that he was both Kay and Lawrence. However, he stubbornly wanted to go with his original concept. People would be suspicious if he disclosed the fact that Lawrence never existed in the first place.\n\"So that’s your preference. Hmm... Just asking, but are you trying to steal Lawrence from his lover, not the other way around?\"\n\"!?\"\nHold up. That’s what the ’close relationship’ between Lawrence and Kay meant in the book being sold in the capital...! Lee Shin Woo was conflicted; he wanted to interrogate the Pope, but he was also fearful of the subject. Fortunately or unfortunately, the Pope soon changed topics to the main point of discussion.\n\"Don’t think about which side you like for the time being. The dungeon we’re headed for now is no joking matter.\"\n\"You’re talking about the level 7 dungeon, right?\"\n\"We’ve named it the Desert of Death.\"\n\"I like it. It’s clear and concise.\"\nAs normal humans couldn’t check stats, it was difficult for them to assess a dungeon properly. So, they would only be able to assess its level by going into the dungeon and fighting the monsters. That was why dungeon casualties were so high. ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ novel·fire.net\n\"When you asked us to look into a level 7 dungeon, we actually tried looking into other places. But you just entered the capital, and you need to make a huge impression for the spotlight to be flashed onto you, so we ultimately came back to this one.\"\n\"It seems quite famous.\"\n\"Of course. In a way, it’s the most famous dungeon in the entire country.\"\nTo be honest, Lee Shin Woo already knew about the dungeon. He had learned about this dungeon from Rem just shortly after it had acquired the golem network; the reason he was able to get information on it so quickly was because of how well known it was. The dungeon wasn’t open to the public, but he had gotten the info once the golem network had spread to the capital.\n’It’s influential enough to reduce the size of the capital.’\nTo be exact, they had attempted to form outer walls to expand the capital, but the creation of said walls was canceled due to the dungeon’s sudden appearance.\nAt the time, the damage done to human life was considerable, so the knight order was mobilized. However, the knights were annihilated. The 12 generals of the surface were sent next, but even they had trouble with it, so it was ’sealed unless the Emperor himself took action’. This just went to show how dangerous the dungeon was.\n\"If all the 12 generals had gone, or if they had risked their lives to clear it, they could’ve done it. Aside from clearing the dungeon, the 12 generals had several other tasks to do; when they actually tried to clear the dungeon with the help of another knight order and the magicians, they found that it was too difficult, as the monsters were too strong. Ultimately, the Emperor only passed a temporary measure: ’the 12 generals would lead a punitive force, consisting of elites from the knight order, and stop the dungeon countercurrent’. Dozens of years have passed since that order was given.\"\n\"Then it must’ve gotten worse inside if it’s been dozens of years.\"\n\"Of course.\"\nIf the 12 generals couldn’t hope to clear it, then it must be hell. But the critical reason that made them entrust the dungeon to him despite all that was...\n\"The internal environment is a tropical desert. You take fire damage just from entering and the inside is teeming with monsters that can use High Rank Fire. No matter how great of a warrior you are, it’s difficult to maintain tip-top condition throughout, and because magicians lack stamina, they can’t even enter the dungeon. The dungeon is protected by its awful environment... But our religious order uses fire, so the entry barriers are less severe for us.\"\n\"Conversely, you’re saying that our fire won’t be very effective against them.\"\n\"That’s why you’re here. All the priests and paladins that have watched you know that your power doesn’t lie entirely in your ability to use fire.\"\nThey had probably noticed how powerful Bursting Thunder was when combined with the fire element. A warrior that possessed impeccable swordsmanship and could wield powerful flames. That was Lee Shin Woo, or Kay’s current image. It wasn’t wrong in real life either. But there was one thing that bothered him.\n’But Bursting Thunder is strongest when used in conjunction with the Lightning element. However, I can’t just pull out a new element out of the blue, and using bones in front of other people is out of the question...’\nOf course, he should be able to progress through the dungeon. He had Zenon’s help right now, as well as the Absorption and Fire Resistance skills. He couldn’t help but feel relaxed. Lee Shin Woo thought of it as training his fire-related skills.\n’Hoo. But it’s still the wrong way to go about this. Though, it doesn’t matter how much time I take; as long as I clear the dungeon, my fame will rise. And if I’m in a pinch, then I can just get away from the others and use my true abilities. ...Should I lay a smokescreen beforehand?’\nWhile Lee Shin Woo was deep in thought, the Pope seemed to misunderstand and spoke in a relaxed tone.\n\"If you’re this worried, then I, the Pope of the Sun God religion, should go with you. I have no intention of losing you here and even less intention of dying in there. Relax.\"\n\"No, I won’t die no matter what. There’s no need for you to enter the dungeon. You’ll get in the way.\"\n\"Get in the way? You shouldn’t look down on my fire magic and resistance. I can also use healing spells too, so...\"\n\"The paladins and the priests will get in the way too. It’s fine that they are willing to risk their lives for their religion, but if I find that they’re holding me down then I’ll send them right back to the surface.\"\n\"M-Mm...\"\nThe Pope groaned. Of course, the Pope had sent the paladins and priests to assist him so that he wouldn’t think that the Sun God religion was using him one-sidedly, but he was still worried. After all, the Sun God religion and the hero Kay had pledged to sink or swim together.\nLee Shin Woo knew how conflicted the Pope was and just laughed softly.\n\"I understand how you feel. But I can’t clear this dungeon as easily as the others, so that’s why I’m telling you this in advance.\"\n\"The other dungeons were easy for you? You truly are impressive. I wonder where you came from.\"\n\"Haha, isn’t this all because of the Sun God’s grace?\"\nLee Shin Woo replied jokingly. After that, Lee Shin Woo could begin to see the ruined dungeon entrance and acted like he was taking something out of his bag when he was really going through his inventory. He took out a bottle of Kerr Century Elemental and passed it to the Pope.\n\"There’s nothing to worry about. You don’t need to be so nervous either. You’re the one who picked this dungeon, so I’ll trust you. So, you should trust me too.\"\n\"Mm. But our knights aren’t weak either. They can protect themselves at the very least.\"\n\"If I think I can clear the dungeon all the way with them, I’ll do so. However, if I judge that that’s impossible, then I’ll send them back. That’s all. ...We don’t have a simple business relationship. I’m looking out for you as well.\"\n\"...Is that so. I didn’t think you’d say something like that.\"\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo was thinking something along the lines of ’I can’t take out a bone while other people are watching’, but unfortunately, the Pope didn’t have the ability to read minds. He’d also accepted the Kerr Century Wine, so any grievances he had were cleared up when he took a sip of the wine.\n\"Alright, I’ll trust you. Once the knights and priests are able to escape, the hero clears the dungeon alone and returns. That’d make quite the story too.\"\n\"I’ll let you take care of that.\"\n\"But for that to be a reality, you have to clear the dungeon. ...Can you prove to me that my ambition wasn’t unreasonable?\"\n\"Hoo, I already told you. If it’s a level 7 dungeon, then everything will turn out just fine. If I was going to give up from something like this, then I wouldn’t have taken your offer in the first place.\"\nAround the time they were finished speaking, the soldiers and knights surrounding the ruins looked like they were at their limit. They were probably responsible for taking out the monsters that occasionally popped out. That meant that...\n\"You really came, Pope (of the Sun God religion).\"\n\"It’s been a long time, Evileye General.\"\nAt the center of the soldiers, a person boasting exceptional energy walked forward and greeted the pope. They wore a full suit of armor, so Lee Shin Woo couldn’t tell their age or even their gender. But when the general raised the visor of their helm, Lee Shin Woo could see her eyes and hear her voice. She was definitely a woman.\n[Lv7 Evileye General Shurina Von Hegel]\nLee Shin Woo tilted his head, as he couldn’t really feel anything magical about her eyes. Her eyes were just a normal, deep green color. Maybe it was an active skill.\n\"Evileye?\"\n\"You don’t know anything, do you? She is one of the 12 generals and is known for her eyes that see through all; she sees her enemy’s weak spots, and snipes her enemies with frightening accuracy.\"\nHe listened to the Pope and then checked her over once more. There was indeed a longbow hanging on her back. It was a level 4... No, a level 5 artifact. Unlike with humans, an artifact was amazing when it hit level 4, and when one found a level 5 artifact, they would have to treasure it forever. It was a piece of equipment fit for one of the 12 generals.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t the only one sizing her up. The Evileye General was in awe of Lee Shin Woo’s weapon and armor (his armor was level 6 and his weapon was level 7, but all she could find out was that his equipment was good), yet was looking at him lukewarmly. Lee Shin Woo kept a portion of his mana from flowing, so it was only natural that she would look at him like that.\n\"Are you the Sun God’s hero? ...So how is he really, Pope?\"\n\"I can only say that the Sun God himself sent him down to revive our religious order and to bring peace to the continent. If you see him in action, then you’ll come to understand. He has truly impressive abilities.\"\n\"Is he truly one of yours? ...You used quite a cunning method. No, it was more reckless than cunning.\"\nThe Pope and Lee Shin Woo’s current plan was ’you know what they’re thinking, but you still have to take it’. It didn’t matter what his purpose for coming here was, so long as his methods were righteous. They would have no reason to refuse Lee Shin Woo, and even if they had legitimate concerns, they had no evidence. Lee Shin Woo’s background was much too ’clean’.\n\"Once he clears this dungeon, no one will be able to say what you just said.\"\n\"Hmph. You’ve just found a man of talent, but because of your impatience, you’re going to overwork him; he’ll die and you’ll end up regretting it. Yes, it’s my Evileye. You (Lee Shin Woo) shouldn’t do everything he says. After all, you only have one life.\"\nAs he thought, the relationship between the Sun God religion and the 12 generals seemed strained. No, perhaps every religious orders’ relationship to the Emperor’s forces was like this.\nPerhaps the Pope hadn’t accompanied Lee Shin Woo to go into the dungeon with him, but to ensure that no conflict would come between him and the Evileye General, he would remain on standby near the dungeon.\n\"Did you hear me?\"\n\"Hmm. Yes, I heard you.\"\nLee Shin Woo briefly thought about verbally manipulating her, but... he decided against it. He didn’t have only one life, but he didn’t want to argue with her.\n\"I’ll leave the outside to you, Pope.\"\n\"Oh, you’re going in already?\"\n\"It seems like she doubts my skills. It’d be much faster to prove my skills with my actions than to try to convince her with words. Now, everyone, prepare yourselves. We’re going in.\"\n\"...I warned you. I’d rather not have to get rid of your corpse, so be careful.\"\nWhile she nagged at him, Lee Shin Woo picked the most elite (level 6) paladins and priests that had followed him here. He only picked those who, at minimum, possessed level 5 Intermediate Fire Resistance. Ultimately, he had picked six level 6 paladins and two level 6 priests.\n\"Alright. Let’s go.\"\n\"Do you really not need me to go in with you?\"\n\"It won’t take very long.\"\nThe Pope said his goodbyes with a relaxed expression. Lee Shin Woo then confidently led his elite force into the dungeon. They felt immense heat at the entrance, but it had no effect on Lee Shin Woo due to his High Rank Fire Resistance.\n’It’s tough. I feel like I’ve experienced this once before.’\n’I’m sharing my resistance with you, so buck up.’\n[Power. I can feel power surging within me!]\nJin acted like he was suffering, yet he walked on top of the sand as if he’d gotten used to it already. Zenon couldn’t handle the power that surged from the hot environment. Finally, the priests and paladins followed close behind, sweat dripping from their faces... Lee Shin Woo sighed softly and stepped forward.\nThus began the dungeon conquest of the Sun God’s hero.",

    "content": "<Chapter 40. Fake Hero Saga - 7>\n[Level 7 elite dungeon - You have acquired the permit to the Cradle of Fire. All stats are increased by 50 within the dungeon. The dungeon’s information is added to your minimap. All actions are buffed within the dungeon.]\nIt was strange; the Pope’s information on the dungeon was all wrong. He didn’t care about the dungeon’s true name, but he didn’t expect it to be an elite dungeon!\nEven so, he couldn’t just pack up and leave. Lee Shin Woo didn’t tell anyone about this and just hurried forward. He was prepared to hit level 8 before he left this dungeon.\n[A strong, hot wind is blowing. High Rank Fire Resistance completely nullifies its effects.]\n[The ground is agonizingly hot. High Rank Fire Resistance completely nullifies its effects.]\n\"You guys all good?\"\n\"I feel like I’m dying.\"\n\"But you’re still not dying.\"\nLee Shin Woo felt like the entrance’s heat was akin to a tepid summer breeze, but the paladins and the priests looked like they were heroes facing off against certain death. Each and every step was difficult for them. Despite them equipping gear that increased their Fire Resistance, it seemed like the heat was too much for them.\n\"I feel like it’s gotten a lot hotter all of a sudden. If His Holiness’s analysis is correct, then it’s a sign that...\"\n\"The monsters inside are further strengthened. Because mankind has only killed the monsters that come outside the dungeon and haven’t tackled the dungeon itself, the trapped mana fundamentally strengthens the monsters...\"\nLee Shin Woo had experienced this phenomenon before, where monsters that have been trapped in a dungeon for several years are many levels stronger than their normal counterparts. This dungeon may be the same. In fact, Lee Shin Woo was shocked that the Magic Empire was so willing to leave a bomb at their very doorstep for so long.\n’It’s the same in both the Magic and the Underground Empire. These Emperors sure love sitting in their rooms doing nothing.’\n’Maybe they’re protecting the palace?’\nNo matter how threatening an elite level 7 dungeon was, the Emperor should be able to deal with it without much difficulty.\nBut the fact that he left the dungeon alone for so many years meant that he had some sort of reason that he couldn’t leave the palace. Or that he’s afraid of something outside... Probably not. Lee Shin Woo couldn’t think of anything that the Emperor would have to be afraid of. If there was, then it’d be the Undead Emperor, or... death itself.\n[I-I’m getting stronger. My power is growing.]\n’Yeah, yeah. Get big and strong.’\n[...Ah, an enemy approaches. From below!]\nLee Shin Woo didn’t need Zenon’s warning, as he sensed the enemy’s presence already. He silently thrust his greatsword into the very heart of the desert. A chilling sound was accompanied by black blood surging up to the surface.\nHe raised his sword, revealing a red scorpion in the place he’d stabbed. The end of its tail was bent like a hook and emitted a red flame, rather than poison. Jin was a bit surprised and took a step back.\n[Lv7 Sun Scorpion]\n\"Everyone, prepare for battle. Be careful, it might be able to shoot its fire over long distances.\"\n\"Understood!\"\nWith Lee Shin Woo at its center, the priests and paladins got into formation, leaving a certain amount of distance between them and Lee Shin Woo. While they were doing that, Lee Shin Woo roughly assessed the Sun Scorpion’s strength and abilities. He ripped off its outer shell and beat on it, and also figured out its methods of attacking.\n\"It’s weak.\"\n’It is?’\nA Sun Scorpion’s greatest strength wasn’t its toughness. It was its heat! It wasn’t very large, but the scorpion’s heat felt as though it had concentrated the surrounding desert’s heat. Moreover, the flame at the end of its tail would bypass Intermediate Fire Resistance entirely and burn the body! Of course, it didn’t have any effect whatsoever on Lee Shin Woo.\nAfter he’d tested this, Lee Shin Woo stamped on it and killed it. When he picked up the ’Fire Tail’ it dropped, it transformed into a ’Fire Tailbone’ like any other non-skeletal drop. He acted like he was pocketing it in his bag, but was actually activating Bone Reinforcement. Activating Bone Reinforcement had become completely natural for him now.\n[Absorbing the Lv7 Fire Tailbone. Health has increased by 1. Skill proficiency in High Rank Fire and High Rank Fire Resistance has increased.]\n’Perfect.’\nHe’d been fighting against either way weaker or way stronger opponents for the longest time, so he was needlessly happy from picking up a same level bone. He was slightly moved by the experience, but there were people who needed him.\n\"Sir Kay, please help!\"\n\"We need help too! These guys are a lot stronger than... Oh, flames incoming!\"\n\"Flame Shield!\"\nIn the short period of time that Lee Shin Woo spent studying the monster, the paladins were forced onto the defensive against three Sun Scorpions. Lee Shin Woo sighed and straightened his greatsword. Then, the Sun Scorpions’ flames disappeared, as if they were all a dream.\nTheir tail flames disappeared too. The scorpions panicked and shook their tails, but it didn’t change anything.\n\"What...!?\"\n\"That’s Elemental Domination! I didn’t think anyone could actually use that ability...\"\n\"Even the Heavenly Light General, the leader of the 12 generals, shouldn’t be at that level...!\"\nElemental Domination. It wasn’t a skill. When one’s element dominates the other, the dominator can seize his opponent’s element and use it as he pleases. It was recorded as a legend, but the paladins and priests were seeing the rebirth of that ability right before their very eyes!\n...Is what they thought, but it wasn’t. Although it was true that Lee Shin Woo was far stronger than the Sun Scorpions and that he could indeed absorb their flames, it wasn’t his own ability, but the Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatsword’s.\n[Special passive skill: Fire Eater - Absorbs the fire element and all fire-related energy.]\n[Special passive skill: Countercurrent - Once it reaches the maximum capacity, the fire energy is concentrated in a single point, amplified, and discharged.]\nHe hadn’t fought against any fire enemies thus far strong enough to warrant the skill’s use, but after thinking about it, he realized he could make good use of the Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatsword here.\nOf course, there might be a limit to how much it could absorb. But at the very least, Lee Shin Woo hadn’t met any enemies as powerful as he was.\n\"I’ll erase the flames, so do your best. If you can’t, then you have to go back, so keep that in mind.\" Official source ıs novel•fire.net\n\"Keuk... I’ll try my best!\"\n\"Yeah, keep it up.\"\nThe level 7 monster, the Sun Scorpion. The level 6 paladins and priests had to fight these monsters with their lives on the line. If it weren’t for the combination of paladins and priests, (their defensive and healing capabilities were impressive, even when compared to other level 6s) then they wouldn’t have stood a chance.\n[Kiaaaaaaaah!]\n[Kishaaaa!]\nBut that only applied if the Sun Scorpions were in tip-top shape. Lee Shin Woo’s greatsword had mercilessly stolen the flames they emitted, as well as the flames that made up their bodies, so they were weakened to the extent that they could barely be called level 7s. At least enough that the paladins and priests could take them on.\n\"It’s sucking their flames well.\"\n’But what are you going to do with the fire? Are you going to use that ’countercurrent’ ability? Against them?’\nLee Shin Woo had already told Jin about the greatsword’s options, so Jin had asked about it while tilting his head. Lee Shin Woo firmly shook his head.\n’I have no intention of wasting that energy. I’m going to use the countercurrent ability, but the target’s going to be me.’\n’...As I thought, you...’\nHe’d thought this when they had first entered the Corrupted Dryad’s domain, which had been filled with trees spewing acid; Lee Shin Woo had to be a masochist! However, Lee Shin Woo immediately rejected that notion.\n’Training my fire resistance is nice and all, but my main goal is to charge the Titan Bone Core.’\nThe level 8 Titan Bone Core, which had charged for 2 months, and would enable him to board the Titan Bone Golem for 4 minutes.\nThe item had evolved, allowing the outside of the golem to endlessly accumulate heat and charge itself, but Lee Shin Woo wanted to go one step further; the heat should be able to reduce the charge time.\n’And if that all goes well.’\nHe’d come to a dungeon filled with the fire element, hadn’t he? Lee Shin Woo secretly hoping to improve the golem’s performance with the loot he got here.\nAfter all, he would hit level 8 soon. The narrower the gap between his stats and the Titan Bone Golem’s, the lower the stats he’d gain from synchronizing with it. That’s why he wanted to improve the golem. In the end, he just didn’t want to lose out on his investment.\n’What about that tailbone?’\n’I absorbed and analyzed it, but it’s unusable. I can’t use something that weak to reinforce the core.’\nWhen he had researched the core with Kratia before, they came to the conclusion that ’this was its limit’, but Lee Shin Woo thought differently now. Didn’t the Bone Gate evolve too? The Titan Bone Core, as well as the Titan Bone Golem it created, could definitely reach new heights. It should be possible. He hoped.\n\"We’ve... successfully hunted them!\"\n\"Ah, just now? Do you need a break?\"\n\"That’s... Yes, just a little...\"\n\"Alright. Then let’s rest for 5 minutes.\"\nWhile Lee Shin Woo was ruminating over the Titan Bone Core, the paladins managed to finish up. With their element sealed, the Sun Scorpions were weaker than other normal level 7s, so the paladins were able to win somehow. And with their victory, the paladins and priests had achieved a feat. Their stats must’ve increased.\n\"If you want to survive even one second longer in this dungeon, then fight desperately like your life depends on it and grow. I’ll watch your backs so you don’t die.\"\n\"\"\"Thank you very much!\"\"\"\nLee Shin Woo collected all of the scorpions’ tails and absorbed them, but left the Perium to the paladins. Sealing the scorpions’ fire was a huge achievement for him as well. He absorbed all of the fire and as a result, his health increased by 1. It was quite effective, as they weren’t even elites.\n’I thought you’d tell them all to leave.’\n’Yeah, that’s what I’d intended to do, but...’\nJin asked, and Lee Shin Woo recalled the Evileye General, the level 7 archer. Of course, Lee Shin Woo was confident that he could overpower her quite easily. Since she was weaker than the Beast General he’d fought before.\nBut while Lee Shin Woo wasn’t here, he didn’t know what might happen. The Pope was level 7, but the Sun God religion didn’t have any other level 7s! Lee Shin Woo had only just realized how little military might the Sun God religion had. He didn’t know how the other religious orders fared, but that wasn’t really important right now.\n’It’s because of my actions that the Sun God religion has gotten famous enough to attract the attention of the 12 generals. It would be irrelevant if everyone liked them, but there are some who clearly oppose or are wary of the Sun God religion. If I continue to stay here, then nothing bad should happen, but if I were to disappear, then...’\n’Aha, you’re trying to nurture the Sun God religion’s elites because you’re worried about them.’\n’Actually, it’s more along the lines of me not wanting my foothold to disappear while I’m gone.’\nThe Pope didn’t think Lee Shin Woo would help them grow forever, but they were forced to concentrate entirely on supporting Lee Shin Woo and fostering his image, so they had no time to pursue anything else. So, Lee Shin Woo would increase their power in their stead.\n’They won’t be at the level of a hero, but I should be able to get them to level 7.’\n’There’s no helping that.’\nEven if they reached level 7, a hero would far surpass them in power. But Lee Shin Woo wanted to train the Sun God religion’s elites so that they could at least stop one or two of the 12 generals. They had fought just three scorpions and were gasping for breath, so it may be impossible, but...\n\"Alright, it’s been 5 minutes. Let’s get a move on.\"\n\"Keuk... Understood!\"\nTheir happy training camp began nonetheless... However, just three days later, after traversing through 30% of the dungeon on foot, Lee Shin Woo was forced to stop their training.\nA level 8 enemy had appeared. It wasn’t even the boss.",

It was no ordinary dungeon; it was an elite dungeon. Not only were the monsters that appeared within this limited, enclosed space huge, but a level 7 elite monster would appear whenever it felt like they were progressing smoothly.\n[Lv7 Elite Solar Scorpion King]\n[Kishaaaaaaaaah!]\n\"Aren’t there not that many level 7 elites in this world?\"\n\"Indeed. However, so much time has passed since this dungeon was formed that...\"\nHe’d already experienced it in the Underground Empire, so he knew just how rare high level dungeons were.\nBut contrary to the Underground Empire, where heroes actively conquered dungeons in order to kill the undead (who ran rampant due to the curse), as well as the Undead Emperor who ruled over them, no one on the surface would seek dangerous monsters or dungeons, so long as no significant harm came from them.\nAnd by neglecting these dungeons for hundreds of years, it came as no surprise that elite level 7 monsters, as well as a high level dungeon (or two) would appear... That’s why Lee Shin Woo was able to enter the level 7 dungeon without any competition.\n\"They must’ve growth as time passed. S-Sir Kay! We cannot defeat this scorpion alone...!\"\n\"Tch.\"\nLee Shin Woo cut through all the bothersome Sun Scorpions with his greatsword, ran towards the paladins and priests, and confronted the Solar Scorpion King one-on-one.\nNot only was its body almost 5 meters tall, but its body was also covered by a tough, red outer shell. If he wanted to pierce through its exoskeleton and inflict damage, then he’d have to put in some work.\n[Kishaaaaaaht!]\n\"Ah.\"\nBut its greatest weapon, its fire, wasn’t working. It shot a yellow flame at him as if it were taking the initiative, but Lee Shin Woo just absorbed it with his greatsword. That wasn’t all.\n\"Zenon.\"\n[I got it.]\nHe called, and Zenon settled into his greatsword. Lee Shin Woo hadn’t consumed him with his greatsword’s Fire Eater ability. Zenon simply dwelled within his greatsword temporarily. But that ’temporary’ effect was quite immense.\n[The Lv7 Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatsword is temporarily reinforced. You now have the ability to command all fire.]\n[The Soul Seeing Eye skill has become Lv3. All stats have increased by 5.]\nHe’d only realized he could do this due to his contract with Sinea... To be exact, it was because of the Soul Seeing Eye.\nThe name of this skill couldn’t be taken at face value, as it not only increased his understanding of souls and anything related to souls but also made it easier to control said souls. It was the same for transferring spirits to items.\nHe needed to look more into the fusion among mana, the soul, and matter, but to sum it up, if a spirit was compatible with a certain item, they could be infused into said item. And the compatibility between Zenon, a fire lizard, and the Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatsword was obviously quite good.\n’Combining with my sword is already this effective, so what’ll happen if he combines with the Titan Bone Golem?’\nHe knew that it was nothing more than a temporary power-up, but he still wanted to try it at least once. The Titan Bone Core was already fully charged. Lee Shin Woo could start it up whenever he wanted, but...\n’I’ll leave it be just in case.’\nLee Shin Woo stared at the scorpion before him. After its initial assault had failed, it seemed to become more cautious, as it had stepped back and watched him... No, that’s not what it was doing. It was actually gathering a frightening amount of mana at the end of its tail. Lee Shin Woo yelled instinctively.\n\"It’s a Solar Beam!?\"\n[Kugyaaaaa!]\nLee Shin Woo marveled at its ’Solar Beam’; at the same time, the Scorpion King screamed and thrust its tail at him! Unfortunately, it wasn’t an actual solar beam. It gathered as much heat as it could in one place (the end of its tail) and swung it around like a mace; Heat Smash would be an apt name for it. A hammer of fire that threatened to smash through any defense!\n\"Heuaaaahp!\"\nIf Lee Shin Woo avoided its strike, then the entire area would be caught aflame. As they were deeply assimilated, Jin could read his thoughts. Jin let out a battle cry and kicked off the ground.\nLee Shin Woo pulled his greatsword back with both hands and then swung it directly at the scorpion’s tail in midair. The sound of their collision resounded throughout the entire dungeon, and all those who were fighting flinched.\n[Kyahahk!?]\nThe moment his greatsword and its tail came into contact with each other, the condensed heat at the end of its tale strangely disappeared.\nThe scorpion hadn’t expected that, yet it didn’t let that bother it and tried to push him back. However, that was its biggest mistake. Its tail had lost both its heat and the force behind it, so Lee Shin Woo’s greatsword just cut through it easily.\nDirty bodily secretions spurt out, but before they could spread, Lee Shin Woo evaporated it all with heat. The scorpion felt immense pain, temporarily halting both its thoughts and its movements. All it was allowed to do was scream in agony.\n[Kishaaaaaahk!]\n\"Heup!\"\nWhereas, Lee Shin Woo relayed his intent to Jin once they landed. Jin changed his stance and prepared to jump again. Lee Shin Woo was amazed, as it felt like he and Jin moved as one. Then, the High Rank Assimilation skill leveled up. It had been quite some time.\n[The High Rank Assimilation skill has become Lv2. Agility and Magic have increased by 10.]\nThe Assimilation skill leveled up, and the two matched their breathing (though the undead couldn’t breathe). Then, they leaped beautifully, as if they had truly become one, and Lee Shin Woo swung his greatsword using the momentum.\nThe sight of them cutting through the rampaging and tail-less scorpion’s head to stomach was akin to the creature with a human’s upper body attached to a horse’s lower body: a Centaur.\n[You have acquired 5,192,430 Perium.]\n[You have acquired the Lv7 Solar Scorpion King’s fire tailbone.]\nHe had only swung his sword twice: once to cut off its tail, and the second to cut through its head. Contrary to its status as an elite level 7 monster, it had died quite pitifully. The paladins and priests, who had just barely defeated the scorpions and turned back towards Lee Shin Woo, saw that scene and spoke in awe.\n\"I knew you were strong, but...\"\n\"To think you’d finish it with just two swings of your sword.\"\n\"I can’t even begin to imitate his horsemanship. It felt like they became one.\"\n\"Hm.\"\nTo be honest, Lee Shin Woo was just as surprised as they were. There was a huge difference in stats between a normal level 7 monster and an elite level 7 monster, with a huge difference between their skills as well.\nFor example, the primary skill that increased Lee Shin Woo’s offensive and defensive abilities was his Rule of Bone skill. When one becomes an elite, they gain a unique attack skill and a buff skill like Rule of Bone. In effect, there would be a huge difference between a normal level 7’s attack/defensive power versus an elite level 7’s, so much so that it was difficult to consider them both level 7.\nThis was the primary reason why elite level 6 monsters could be more powerful than normal level 7 monsters. However, he’d killed an elite in just two swings of his greatsword. If he’d used Bursting Thunder as well, then he’d probably have managed to kill it in one. It made no sense, no matter how much stronger he’d gotten. If that’s the case, then...\n’Zenon, did you feel anything?’\n’I think the scorpion could increase its defense and magic resistance with its fire mana. The moment you attacked, I could feel something being sucked away from it.’\n’Aha. I felt the mana when we clashed, but I thought it was nothing and ignored it. So that’s what it was.’\nHe understood immediately. Not only had he nullified his enemy’s attack, but also nullified its shield as well. As a result, he was able to cut through it easily. Lee Shin Woo felt a bit sorry for the Solar Scorpion King.\n’Wait, this... Mm, this won’t work either.’ Updates are released by NoveI★Fire.net\nHowever, the loot was disappointing. He had been hopeful, as it was the loot of a level 7 elite, but its tailbone was no different than an agglomeration of several normal Sun Scorpions’ tailbones. He wouldn’t be able to reinforce the Titan Bone Golem with this.\n\"If the elites won’t work, then I suppose I have no choice but to hope that the boss... Huh? What’s wrong with you guys?\"\n\"T-That’s... Sir Kay.\"\nThe paladins and priests, who had been watching him, were now looking behind him. Lee Shin Woo tightly gripped his greatsword and looked behind him. Smack dab in the middle of the desert, the sand was... being sucked down.\n\"Quicksand?\"\n\"No, it’s not a natural phenomenon.\"\nLee Shin Woo sensed the presence of something huge beneath it, drawing the sand towards it. No, it wasn’t really ’drawing’ the sand in. It was from hot wind. An artificial, powerful flow of air was added to the heat to create it.\nThe hot air drew in not only all the sand here, but all the sand in the dungeon itself. At this rate, they wouldn’t be safe here! Although he was flustered, Lee Shin Woo tried to give the paladins and priests their orders, but then saw a message.\n[Level 7 elite dungeon - You have found Cradle of Fire’s truth path. The dungeon’s information has been updated. Magic has increased by 10.]\n[Level 8 dungeon - Sun’s Nest. All stats are increased by 75 within the dungeon. The dungeon’s information is added to your minimap. All actions are buffed within the dungeon.]\n\"...Ha.\"\nThis was his first time in a level 7 dungeon, yet that same dungeon had been upgraded to a level 8 dungeon. Rather than feeling fear or terror, Lee Shin Woo was speechless. But for some reason, a corner of his face was smiling.\n\"If it’s a level 8 dungeon... then a level 9 boss might show up.\"\n\"L-Level 9!? Humanity can’t contend with a level 9! Unless the Emperor intervenes himself!\"\n\"Of course it’s impossible. It’s obviously impossible. ...But what if...\"\nWhat if this dungeon hadn’t been a fire element dungeon? What if he hadn’t possessed the Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatsword? What if he hadn’t had the good fortune of meeting Zenon and learning how to infuse him into a weapon? What if he hadn’t had the Titan Bone Core?\nThen he would have had to give up on this dungeon.\n\"I’ve come this far, I can’t just leave. You guys, get out of here now. Tell the Pope what’s happened and make sure no one approaches the dungeon.\"\n\"Sir Kay!? You’re not thinking of going in, are you... Keuk!\"\nThe hot air intensified and the sand they (the paladins and priests) were standing on began to crumble. It was clear that they didn’t have much time to retreat! The paladins and the priests looked hesitant. The fact that they hadn’t run away immediately touched Lee Shin Woo to no small measure.\n\"I’m not interested in your feelings right now, so hurry and run.\"\n\"Sir Kay!\"\n\"Keep these two things in mind. First, I can return alive, whether I succeed in conquering the dungeon or not. Second, it’ll be dangerous for anyone besides myself to come near the dungeon. If you understand, then get out and give the pope my message!\"\n\"Y-Yes sir!\"\nAll the paladins and priests simultaneously turned around and began to run at his command. The hot wind had begun to affect the entire dungeon, and the sand began to coil and rise. It attempted to draw them in as well, but before it could, Lee Shin Woo extended his greatsword, absorbing and nullifying the hot air.\n\"You see, I can absorb more than just heat.\"\nWhile he was at it, Lee Shin Woo used air to push the paladins and priests towards the dungeon’s entrance. When he was sure they were safe, he turned around.\nLee Shin Woo and Jin slowly sank into the sand while being buffered by the hot air... and gazed into the eyes of the mastermind of this phenomena.\n[Lv8 Elite Desert Ghost]\nIt was time the Sun God’s hero underwent a true test.",

    "content": "<Chapter 41. The Second Advent of the Sun God - 1>\nThe level 8 Elite Desert Ghost looked half scorpion and half spider, and was a huge 20 meters tall. It was so striking that he would believe it if someone told him that this was the boss!\n[You are facing a higher leveled foe! The Rebellion skill activates, and all stats are increased by 16%. Due to the existence of a partner, who you can share everything with, all stats are increased by an additional 11%, and all these effects are shared with your partner!]\n\"They’ve all left, right?\"\n\"Yeah, they’re gone.\"\n\"Good. Then, shall we begin?\"\n\"...Why are you putting your hand on my back?\"\nThe sand, which formed the desert, was devoured by the hot wind and disappeared. Lee Shin Woo couldn’t defy gravity and began to fall, but even then, he remained calm. Jin remained calm as well, thinking ’Shin Woo will do something about it’, but... Lee Shin Woo placed his hand on Jin’s back, causing Jin to flinch.\n\"I guess I have no choice.\"\n\"Hey, what are you doing all of a sudden... Heugyak!\"\nIt was only for a brief moment, but Jin was flustered and confused. However, he was soon able to get a hold of himself, as images and messages flowed into his head through the Assimilation skill. Calmly thinking about it, he was the strange one, as he was thinking about something so preposterous while they were falling down. No, the images flowing through his head were just as preposterous.\n\"I told you, I won’t sprout wings!\"\n\"The image is good enough. The design’s perfect. I’m going.\"\n\"I’ve already tried it before. I told you, I can’t do it!\"\nTo be honest, Jin had once thought that he could sprout wings. Why? In the past, when Lee Shin Woo had used Bone Reinforcement on him with winged monsters’ bones, Jin was lucky enough to learn the ’Fly’ skill.\nOf course, he was really flustered back then, and tried his best to hide the truth from Lee Shin Woo. He then tried practicing it by himself later, but... He failed.\n\"No, you can do it. Focus on sharing our consciousness. I was going to attempt this after I’d become more accustomed to the Disguise skill but...\"\n\"There’s no way it’d work with just your Disguise skill... Huh?\"\nJin couldn’t create wings, even if he used his ’Steel Heart’ ability. The Fly skill would only allow an individual to fly if they had the means to do so; it wasn’t a skill that created weighty, steel wings that would enable him to fly.\nIf that’s the case, then why did he even receive the Fly skill? If an individual isn’t capable of using a skill, then they wouldn’t learn it, but why... Jin questioned and completely gave up on their dream (it was really more Lee Shin Woo’s dream) of flying. He was a little disappointed that he wasn’t able to make Lee Shin Woo’s dream come true, but that was a secret.\n[Guooooooh!]\n\"Hey, that guy’s locked onto us. Hurry up.\"\n\"Mmmm...!\"\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo’s images were much clearer than his own attempts. He would focus Steel Heart on his body and create a new, exterior armor...\n\"Like the design?\"\n\"Yeah. Disguise!\"\n\"S-Steel Heart!\"\nWhen the level 9 Disguise skill was used on himself, it was absolute. However, when it was used on other people, it was quite strict, especially for things that didn’t originally exist... one could say that creating wings out of thin air was pretty much impossible.\nOf course, Jin possessed the Steel Heart skill, which coated his body in a steel-like substance using mana. Because of that, it wasn’t difficult for him to attach wings to his body. But this would result in the same outcome as when he had tried it by himself. This time though, Lee Shin Woo had designed the wings, all of the details... And the power system as well.\nAnd through the simultaneous activation of Lee Shin Woo’s Disguise and Jin’s Steel Heart skills, the image became a reality! Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on NoveI-Fire.ɴet\n\"Jeez, this... is really embarrassing!\"\nWith the slightest of movements, Jin could easily control the tough, huge steel wings, while also having firm abdominal armor to support them.\nThese wings should allow him to ’slide down a slope’, but it obviously didn’t end there. The wings, the abdominal armor, and the leg armor were perforated with dozens of fine holes, and pipes were routed throughout the armor, acting as its power supply.\n\"Jin, all you need to do is let it out!\"\n\"Keuk... Magic Breath!\"\nThrough the combination of the Disguise and Steel Heart skills, Jin looked outwardly like a steel Pegasus. While they plummeted to the ground, Jin was somehow able to use his Magic Breath.\nDue to their near perfect Assimilation, Jin was able to store Lee Shin Woo’s High Rank Wind with his Magic Breath!\n\"I did it!\"\nAt the end of his desperate training, Jin had become capable of discharging Magic Breath from anywhere on his body. The Magic Breath flowed out of his toes first, and then traveled along the pipes and spurted wind out of all the holes connected to them. They began to float. He wasn’t sure if they could truly fly yet, but they could at least float!\nBut the wind was too chaotic, so they were immediately overturned within the air.\n\"Ugyak!\"\n\"Control it! Keep your balance... That guy’s opening its mouth!\"\n[Kii, Kihiiii... Kyaaaaaaah!]\nAlthough the Desert Ghost had sucked up all the sand, it wouldn’t allow any bugs to buzz around in the air.\nIt marked its target and opened its mouth. The rotating sand, heat, and wind mixed together and changed into something unknown, like lava. Since it wasn’t all elemental power and had some substance to it, Lee Shin Woo knew couldn’t handle it with just his Absorption skill!\n’We have to dodge...!’\nHis body became tense at the thought of avoiding it, but Jin recklessly discharged the wind element through his Magic Breath (in other words, Wind Breath). But releasing wind like this wouldn’t do any good. They wouldn’t be able to maneuver properly; at best, they would be able to hover.\nJin was a sprinter in the past, so he had excellent motor skills. Even so, it would be impossible for him to control something he’d never had in the past. But then...\n\"...Ah!\"\nHis Flying skill activated.\n[The Low Rank Fly skill has become Lv10 and evolves to the intermediate level! Agility has increased by 75. You now have an unclear understanding of the fundamentals of flying. You can fly with any means at your disposal. The higher your agility, the quicker and more safely you can fly.]\nWhen he had first acquired the Fly skill, it was low rank level 8. Of course, the level was meaningless, as he couldn’t even fly back then, but it had went up by two levels all of a sudden and reached the intermediate level.\nAt that moment, Jin instinctively understood how to move the wings Lee Shin Woo had designed for him. The wings fluttered, and the finely controlled wind was sprayed out.\n[Gugyaaaaah!]\n\"Nice work, Jin!\"\n\"Just wait until after the battle!\"\nAll of Jin’s superlative speed was concentrated entirely into his flight; at that moment, they, who had been flying round and round, disappeared instantly and reappeared in the opposite direction. Rather than flight, it was more like teleportation!\nThe clump of lava passed where they had just been and flew far away; it hit the dungeon’s wall and melted it. If it continuously spewed out lava, then it would be able to melt the entire dungeon.\n[Guoooooooh!]\n\"Hoo. Do you think you can do it, Shin Woo? Fighting while running on the ground and flying in the air are completely different.\"\n\"Ha, of course they are.\"\nJust a short while ago he’d been so unconfident, but now... Jin, who’d gotten a feel for flying, ignored the hot wind, as well as the rotating sand storm within it, and circled around the Desert Ghost with ease. On the contrary, it worried Lee Shin Woo.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo was already connected to Jin. If Jin could do it, then Lee Shin Woo could too. In conclusion, with enough spatial awareness (front to back, left and right, and top to bottom), all one needed to do was control their body!\n\"Alright, then... I’m going!\"\nOnce Jin stepped in the air, they charged at the Desert Ghost with explosive acceleration!\nThe Desert Ghost attempted to eviscerate them by making use of the hot air around it; it divided the air into dozens of wind blades and rushed towards them, but Jin avoided them with ease and continued to charge forward. Even the sandstorm, which had fused with the wind, was of no use. Its wind couldn’t even catch Jin’s shadow!\nAlthough they were penetrating through a level 8 elite’s defenses (the sandstorm and hot air), they were still unscathed. But in order to attack it, Lee Shin Woo would have to go face-to-face with the shield of hot wind that covered its body.\nHe got a signal from Jin, inwardly nodded his head, and gripped his greatsword. Now!\n[Kyahaaaaah!]\n\"Heup!\"\nLee Shin Woo forcefully swung his greatsword, his blade emitting a brilliant red light. From an outsider’s point of view, it may look like a toothpick against a natural disaster, but at the moment of impact, the natural disaster was the one that folded. A portion of the Desert Ghost’s typhoon, which consisted of the sand, the wind, and the heat, was destroyed.\nHowever, that wasn’t the end. It had lost its balance, and Lee Shin Woo absorbed the typhoon’s energy into his greatsword. Then, the greatsword released wind blades at the Desert Ghost’s face!\n[Gyaaaah!?]\nEven while flustered, the Desert Ghost quickly fused the wind and heat near its face and formed a shield to protect itself. Jin followed up on Lee Shin Woo’s wind blades by picking up the pace. The greatsword, which emanated a red light, let out a crackle and was covered in golden lightning.\n\"Suck out all of its heat!\"\n[I can’t suck out all of it. However... I can do something about that shield!]\nThe wind blades crashed into the monster’s shield and disappeared; they blew up right in front of its face, so the monster briefly closed its eyes and stiffened. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo’s greatsword sliced through the shield like paper and burrowed into its shell!\n\"Thunder Strike!\"\nLee Shin Woo unleashed Bursting Thunder’s true power, causing its forehead to explode. It didn’t matter that his opponent was a level 8 elite. His Rebellion skill had increased his stats by almost 30% and adding the speed of Jin’s flight, as well as Zenon’s ability (which nullified the Desert Ghost’s fire shield), Lee Shin Woo managed to land a single powerful strike with Bursting Thunder.\nPlus.\n\"Thorn Shadow!\"\n[Kyahaaaaaaahk!]\n[Critical Hit!]\nShadow greatswords sprouted from the greatsword’s edge and flailed around inside its head. The serious injury caused the surrounding wind to momentarily stop, and the previously uplifted sand to fall.\nIt screamed, and Lee Shin Woo knew he had to take it down quickly; if not, then its scream could attract other monsters over. First, Lee Shin Woo quickly pulled out his greatsword. Jin ’jet blasted’ it and quickly retreated. Immediately after, the lava around it began to boil over.\n[Kyahaaaaaaaahk!]\n\"That’s no ’Desert’ Ghost. It’s more of a Lava Ghost.\"\n\"Enough with the jokes. Just focus on killing it!\"\nThe Desert Ghost was pissed, as it had sustained a grievous injury on its face. It began launching its lava haphazardly. It didn’t think it could catch Jin, so it hoped that if it shot lava plumes in every which way, then one of them would hit him!\nBut against Jin, that was the worst possible choice. He didn’t look for a pattern; he instead saw through the attacks with his frightening reflexes and senses in order to avoid them.\n[Kushaaaaaaaah!]\n[Kyahaaaaahk!]\nThen, Lee Shin Woo suddenly felt ominous. The fallen sand had disturbed the monsters underground; these infuriated monsters had begun to mobilize!\n[Lv8 Solar Scarab]\nThe Solar Scarabs were encased in shells and their wings rattled unpleasantly as they flew over. From a purely external view, they looked like stag beetles, but each one of them were more than 3 meters tall and they were obviously level 8.\nLee Shin Woo and Jin were instantly surrounded by dozens of level 8 monsters. This was an uncommon experience both underground and on the surface. If hell existed, then this was probably what it was referring to.\n\"Hey, what are you going to do about this?\"\nJin spoke as though they could run away easily (due to his newly gained wings), but Lee Shin Woo couldn’t contain his smile.\n\"If we play our cards right, you may be able to reach level 8 too.\"\n\"I was stupid to ask.\"\nWhy did he even ask, when he already knew how Lee Shin Woo would respond!? Jin sighed and felt more at ease for some reason. It felt like all those suffocating feelings he had been feeling on the surface were disappearing. He and Lee Shin Woo were the only two people here. They would combine their strength and get out of this hardship by themselves.\nThey were both comrades who trusted each other 100%. This sense of unity could only be felt now. Everything culminated into his relaxed sense of calm. Jin knew he was distorted, as he felt relief in that. But it didn’t matter.\n’It’s a disease.’\nJin grinned and unfolded his steel wings. Even if a Pegasus were to appear, Jin was confident he could match it in flight.\n[The Intermediate Fly skill has become Lv3. Agility has increased by 60.]\n\"Alright, let’s go!\"\nOnce he fluttered his wings, the two became one, and they eventually became a streak of light.\nThe level 8 dungeon was nothing more than a date spot to Jin now.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 41 part2",
    "content": "<Chapter 41. The Second Advent of the Sun God - 2>\nNo matter what he did, Jin’s skill would multiply his agility gain by a factor of three. Therefore, his agility stat was truly abnormal. Assuming Jin’s total stats were 10,000, his agility would be 6,000, 2,000 would be in magic, and the remaining 2,000 would be split between strength and health.\nJust to be clear, if Jin wasn’t a horse, then he wouldn’t have a way to effectively use these stats. At least he was armed with Steel Heart, a skill that changed his magic into strength or health; with it, he was able to deal with this imbalance, but it didn’t change the fundamental problem.\nThese disparate stats were special compared to other horses, as well as flying monsters.\n[The Intermediate Fly skill has become Lv4. Agility has increased by 30.]\nSo once Jin, who’d acquired the Fly skill and a means to fly, actually began to fly, his flight was in a dimension of its own; compared to other monsters’ flight, it was like a superhuman ability.\nWith the wings Lee Shin Woo designed and his own Wind Breath, Jin freely accelerated and decelerated repeatedly. He, who could fly freely regardless of what direction he went, befitted the title of Child of Light. Jin was so fast that everything else seemed to come to a stop.\n[Kashat!]\n[Kihik!? Kiik?]\n\"Where are you looking? That’s an afterimage!\"\n\"You’re doing great, Jin!\"\nThe Desert Ghost couldn’t overpower them, despite the level 8 stat bonus, since Lee Shin Woo’s Rebellion skill was being applied to Jin as well!\nAlthough the Solar Scarabs knew how to fly, their skill level wasn’t very high, so Jin could easily around with them. Lee Shin Woo and Jin didn’t have to worry about the scarabs for now.\n[The Intermediate Fly skill has become Lv5. Agility has increased by 30.]\n\"Ah, my stats exceeded 10,000 because of the skill level up.\"\n\"10,000 stats aren’t the issue here. I told you, we’re leaving this dungeon once we’ve both hit level 8! Heup!\"\n[Kehek!?]\nLee Shin Woo said and simultaneously extended his greatsword once more. The Desert Ghost had shot lava in every which direction in order to catch Lee Shin Woo and Jin, who both kept appearing and vanishing in thin air. But then, Lee Shin Woo’s greatsword dug into the Desert Ghost’s forehead again and discharged a bolt of powerful lightning. To be exact, this was his third attack.\nHe wasn’t sure why, but it couldn’t move from its spot; plus, Jin had gained wings and was actually flying around, so there was no way it could win. The carapace over its head had been half-way crushed. If he attacked a few more times, then he should be able to kill it.\n[Kyaaaaaaaahk!]\n\"Huh!?\"\nThen, the Desert Ghost exploded, as it couldn’t bear the one-sided beating! To be exact, it blew up its remaining exoskeleton, where its powerful flames were concentrated. Due to its size, the exploding flames covered the entire dungeon.\nIt didn’t discriminate between friend or foe; the flames mercilessly melted the Solar Scarabs as well. There were some who took the attack straight up and disappeared right then and there, as well as some who lost their wings and fell down to the ground. All he was sure of was that hundreds of level 8s had been incapacitated by the attack.\nIt was an attack that truly fit a level 8 elite’s finishing move. Even if one were to equip fire resistant armor from head to toe they wouldn’t be able to survive this torrent of lava.\n\"Hoo.\"\n[E-Eight scale greatswords!? What happened!?]\nThat’s right. Through his Bone Armory skill, Lee Shin Woo had summoned 8 Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatswords, aside from his armor (since he had added level 6 fire to his armor, he was assured of its resistance) and the Prayer of the Dead (the level 7 cape that possessed the High Speed Casting and Magic Reinforcement options, and would buff any action related to magic). No one, other than Lee Shin Woo, could replicate such a feat!\n\"Why didn’t you just summon those when they (the priests and paladins) left?\"\n\"SSeup, I wanted to see if I could beat it with a single sword...\"\nThe torrent of flames, which had covered the area surrounding Lee Shin Woo and Jin, was being absorbed by the eight greatswords. Lee Shin Woo looked at the greatswords and muttered in disappointment.\nThe reason he went with just one sword was simple. He wanted to know how effective his Bursting Thunder skill was. However, he could no longer demand for a one-on-one confrontation any longer, so being stubborn would just be a waste of time. Now, he had no choice but to go into ’annihilation mode’.\n[How are there eight scale greatswords!? Is that an Elementalist’s ability too!?]\n\"The scale greatsword’s information is kept inside me. I can only summon a certain amount of them, but I can keep summoning items with the same info.\"\n[I-Is that so... You can summon treasures whenever you wish. I see. I suppose that is possible.]\n[Kyahaaahk!]\nZenon realized that what Lee Shin Woo had shown before was merely a portion of his true abilities and spoke gibberish while shocked. The Desert Ghost, who’d shed its exoskeleton and revealed its disgusting body within, noticed that they were still standing and shrieked.\nIt was no simple scream. It was composed of ultrasonic waves reinforced by High Rank Wind.\n\"Heut!\"\n[Kya!?]\nThe ultrasonic waves traveled at the speed of sound, yet Jin moved his body and easily dodged the attack. It was then that the Desert Ghost realized that they were unscathed and was shocked. Why? It was such a powerful attack that even the Solar Scarabs, which possessed Fire Resistance, were severely harmed!\n\"Let’s go clean up. It feels like we lucked out, so I feel bad, [1] but... Let’s go!\"\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo didn’t even give it the time to respond. The 7 Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatswords followed his gentle hand gesture and shot out all at once, aside from the one of he was holding (the one Zenon was inside of); the swords pierced the exposed, disgusting skin of its head.\nHe had further reinforced them with wind mana, so their speed was comparable to the Desert Ghost’s ultrasonic waves. The Desert Ghost couldn’t move from its spot, so it obviously wasn’t able to dodge the blades anyway.\n[Kiaaaaaaaahk!]\nWhen it blew up its exoskeleton, it made sure to keep its head protected. But once the seven greatswords dug into its head and the Fire Eater option activated, its shell began to shrink.\nIts shell was a result of its flames, so there was no way it would remain unscathed when the seven greatswords were sucking out all of said flames.\n[Kihik, Kiheeeehk...!]\n[Impossible. How can a human be allowed to possess such power...!?]\nZenon watched as the Desert Ghost died a dog’s death, despite its status as a level 8 elite, and shuddered.\nOf course, this was all due to the option of the Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatsword; the option was incredibly effective against the monsters inside this dungeon. Even Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t be able to dominate a level 8 elite monster normally, but Zenon didn’t know that.\n\"Zenon, let’s finish it.\"\n[Ah, I got it.]\n\"Jin.\"\n\"Ok.\"\nIt was truly ironic that Lee Shin Woo was using his weapon, which possessed a high level of fire, to absorb fire rather than release it, but... What he’d learned today would help him in the future. What exactly were elements? At the end of his study, he should find what he was looking for.\n\"Ha!\"\nJin accelerated. The seven greatswords pierced through its head and its flames were being sucked away as well. The Desert Ghost rampaged about and violently twisted its body, but it still couldn’t move from its spot.\nLee Shin Woo suddenly thought about the possibility of it being bound here by something underground...\n\"Lightning Strike!\"\n[Kyak!]\nLee Shin Woo raised his sword into the air and sliced its head open. He absorbed its flames and emitted lightning out of his blade, unleashing a powerful attack. It not only cut its skin in half but the brain and respiratory organs that lay hidden within.\nFlames burst from its body as a last-ditch effort to kill Lee Shin Woo, but even that was divided and absorbed by the eight greatswords.\n[You defeated an elite enemy with ease, and in the process, defeated the other higher leveled foes as well! You used an enemy to kill several of your other foes; a truly shocking karma! All stats have increased by 10.]\n[The Rebellion skill has become Lv5 and the skill’s effectiveness increases.

The Lucky Strike skill has become Lv3!]\n[You have acquired the Desert Ghost’s Head Carapace.]\n[You have acquired the Lv8 Flame Wind Core. Through Bone Reinforcement, it has transformed into the Lv8 Flame Wind Bone Core.]\nLee Shin Woo tilted his head, as he didn’t quite understand what it meant by him defeating all the higher leveled enemies. Now that he thought about it, the Solar Scarabs that had been caught in the huge explosion had been level 8! He didn’t even have a chance to fight against them and hadn’t even been attacked; he’d considered them a weak mob...!\n\"Jin, have you achieved a feat of some kind?\"\n\"Two achievements related to flying. My agility went up again...\"\n\"As I thought, you were destined to fly. Just as planned.\"\n\"Even so, I’m not going to forgive you for suddenly testing it out in the field.\"\n\"It’s all a misunderstanding. My secretary planned it all... Huh?\"\nThe dungeon suddenly vibrated while Lee Shin Woo (who’d collected all the loot) went back and forth with Jin like always. He wondered whether the floor beneath them would collapse with the Desert Ghost’s death. Depending on the situation, Lee Shin Woo might have to run without hesitating. While thinking that, he looked down at the distant underground.\nWith the Desert Ghost’s disappearance, the opening to the underground could now barely be seen, and Lee Shin Woo saw darkness energy leaking from that crack. Lee Shin Woo swallowed and said.\n\"...This feels kind of dangerous.\"\n\"That’s funny. I thought the same thing.\"\nIt would’ve been ok if it were normal darkness, but the darkness had been changed. In other words, it was the same energy as the curse that permeated the Underground Empire. Some of the other, lower level dungeons he’d cleared had been affected by the curse, but a level 8 dungeon...\n\"This dungeon’s boss... It might be stronger than the 12 generals.\"\n\"Well, the Desert Ghost was stronger than most of the 12 generals anyway. That’s not unexpected.\"\n\"No, what I’m saying is that it might be stronger than the Archmage.\"\nHe automatically gripped his greatsword tightly. On one hand, he thought ’It’s dangerous’, and on the other, he thought ’I’m lucky to be given this opportunity before fighting the Archmage’. Then, black lava surged from underground. This was the primary cause of Lee Shin Woo’s tension. ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ novel[f]ire.net\nIt was no mere fire or darkness, a vestige of his long forgotten chuunibyou syndrome, or his past Flames of Revenge... It was a new element formed from the combination of the fire and darkness elements.\n[Kyahaaaaaaaah!]\n[Kiiiiiiik!]\n[Kugugaaaahk!]\n\"These bastards, what are they even saying?\"\n\"Mm.\"\nJin imaged the fierce battle ahead of them and joked weakly. Lee Shin Woo saw the three Desert Ghosts as they stood up within the lava... They had become undead and were reborn as [Lv8 Fiery Sand’s Dark Flame Ghost]. He looked at the elite monsters and shrugged his shoulders.\n\"Doesn’t seem like they want to become friends, huh?\"\n[1] T/N: The expression he uses here is \"eating it raw\".

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 41 part3",
    "content": "<Chapter 41. The Second Advent of the Sun God - 3>\nLee Shin Woo decided to call the dark flames that the Fiery Sand’s Dark Flame Ghosts wielded a ’fusion element’.\nThough the elements could exhibit extraordinary power based on the one wielding them, the dark flame was well beyond that. It wasn’t a simple fusion of the two elements, fire and darkness, with the end result retaining properties of both; instead, it was a completely different element.\n\"Jeez, that was dangerous! We’re done for if they eat your skill, so be careful!\"\n\"I... know! Uaaaaah! They’re coming again! They’re coming from over there too!\"\nIf he had to use one word to describe it, it would be ’plundering’. The dark flame erased anything it touched, and it would then be given to the element’s wielder.\nHow would darkness and fire fuse to result in something like that? Moreover, when one is afflicted by the undead curse, they usually just become an undead; so then how did they awaken the darkness element and fuse it together with the fire element!?\n\"Damn it. These guys are copying my Absorption ability...!\"\n\"You’re still joking around, so I guess we’re still ok.\"\n\"My bad, Jin. It’s not a joke. I think we’re really going to die.\"\nJin’s Fly skill continued to level up, even though they were in the midst of battle, so Jin continued to fly faster and faster. He disappeared from afar and then reappeared as if he were a bolt of lightning. The only reason they were still alive was because of Jin’s exceptional flight.\nHowever, the dark flame was not only far-reaching, but it also began to eat into the very fabric of space itself; they were slowly losing places to run away to. Yeah, they had to dodge the dark flames for now.\n\"So... You still can’t absorb that dark flame?\"\n\"If I want to absorb that element unscathed, then I need to understand it. Even I can’t fully understand it by just looking at it once! But I’m trying my best to...\"\nLee Shin Woo knew he needed to risk his life to grow. Lee Shin Woo tried to analyze their dark flames with one of his bones, but one of the Dark Flame Ghosts ended up eating his Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatsword, gaining its Countercurrent and Fire Eater effects. As a result, the danger of this battle increased sharply.\nSeeing that, Lee Shin Woo was shocked, as the scale greatsword was completely erased. The dark flame almost controlled all the space inside the dungeon, so they would be able to devour any of his bone armaments before he could hit them. But what would happen if his main body was devoured by the flames? He didn’t even want to think about the skills they might gain.\n\"It’s our chance! Rising Thunder!\"\n[Kyahaaahk!]\n\"Ugh! They’re coming!\"\nTheir saving grace was the fact that they could beat them with a powerful element, as the dark flame couldn’t consume it all. They occasionally landed some hits while they avoided the dark flame and hectically ran away. Before the Dark Flame Ghosts could retaliate, they would just run like hell.\nBut at this rate, they would die before they took down one of them. It had been a long time since he was in such danger. Lee Shin Woo saw the dark flames dot the dungeon with large cavities and slightly, very slightly thought of death.\nCouldn’t he just take these guys to the Underground Empire? They would take care of the Undead Emperor for him. But then he’d have to pledge his loyalty to these bugs, as they would be the new Emperor!\n\"Shin Woo, should we run away?\"\n\"Let me think about it for a bit longer. I could bring these guys to the capital and see how the Emperor reacts, but if I do that, then it’ll be all over for me, the Sun God religion, and Lawrence once the situation is resolved. Then, everything I’ve done thus far will go up in smoke.\"\nIf he had no other options, then he would ride the Titan Bone Golem and vie for supremacy. But if they were to devour that as well and they were able to imitate the outer shell of a golem, then it really would be the end of the road for them. ...Wait a sec.\n\"They eat it and then they’re able to use it...\"\n\"If you’ve thought of something, then hurry up. At this rate, we’ll really die!\"\n\"Wait a sec. I’m not sure it’ll work. If it fails, then it’ll just increase their defense... But.\"\nIt was a lot better than running away. Now, he had no choice but to trust in his abilities and brave the risks! Lee Shin Woo resolved himself. Then, he summoned seven giant pieces of armor around him. They were just huge pieces of armor that held no element within them.\nBecause he’d used Gigantification, he consumed quite a bit of mana, but Lee Shin Woo was undeterred and launched the seven pieces of armor in every direction. The dark flames rushed over as if they were ants that had found a piece of candy, but it would take a long time for them to fully consume the armor due to their size. By using them as a distraction, Lee Shin Woo was somewhat able to erase the dark flames that filled the dungeon.\n\"We can take a breath now, but won’t it become a problem if they eat those?\"\n\"Let them eat first and then let’s think.\"\nThe dark flame wasn’t absolute. Was it because it was a fused element? While using the dark flame to eat something, their main bodies became sluggish. Lee Shin Woo took advantage of this opportunity (of them eating the pieces of bone armor) and used Lightning Sprint, causing a deep scar on one of their jet-black heads.\n[Kyahaaaaaah!]\n\"Good boy. Now explode!\"\nIf he could, he would use his combination attack (Lightning Sprint and explosion) to kill the one that had consumed his Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatsword, but the explosion had barely broken the exoskeleton around its head. And it had to take that moment to finish eating and begin to change.\n[Kiii... Kihiaaaaaaah!]\nThe broken and unbroken areas were all covered in... black bones.\n\"See, I knew this would happen!\"\n\"Yeah, I knew that would happen too.\"\nThe Fiery Sand’s Dark Flame Ghost finished eating the bone armor and began to change. The bone armor they’d absorbed was obviously tougher than their own shells. They, who had stolen an ability from their enemy, looked quite imposing.\n\"Hey, I don’t think we can even get through that anymore...\"\n\"Of course we can’t. The dark flame’s even wrapping around the armor.\"\n\"Then you made them stronger on purpose? Are you trying to use them to kill the Magic Emperor?\"\n\"Nope. Now I have to try something.\"\nLee Shin Woo gazed at the giant bugs and tightly clenched his fist.\nEither way was hard. However, this way was much more likely to work than absorbing the dark flame. He gritted his teeth.\n’I’ve been practicing. Ever since I came to that realization against the Beast General...!’\nAlthough they’d eaten the giant armors, it seemed like they were still hungry, as their tongues darted in and out of their mouths and they lunged towards them. Lee Shin Woo relied entirely on Jin to dodge them and then concentrated on a single skill.\nHe concentrated so hard that even his Assimilation skill was released, but Jin didn’t realize, as he was flying around, dodging the dark flame that came at him from each and every direction.\n\"If they could move, then we would already be dead... Shin Woo, are you almost done?\"\n\"...\"\nLee Shin Woo was silent, even though he usually talked throughout the battle. His silence made Jin feel uneasy. The dark flame he’d erased through the armor was beginning to spread gradually once more. At this point, they had to choose whether to cut down their numbers or to run away from the dungeon; if they didn’t, then they really would die.\nAlthough they possessed revival abilities, they had no way of overpowering the Dark Flame Ghosts. Would they be able to win if they self-destructed every single time they revived, causing the Dark Flame Ghosts to accumulate damage?\n’I should’ve known ever since this guy came into the dungeon all smug.’\nNormally, Lee Shin Woo made his choices very carefully and then made his move, but there were times when he became overconfident; whenever he did, something unimaginable happened, which would put them in a puzzling situation.\nThey were always able to adapt and overcome their enemies, but that meant that if they couldn’t adapt, they would die right then and there. True, Lee Shin Woo’s abilities and his combat sense were incredible, but what would he do against these beasts...\nThen, Jin saw one of the monsters flinch.\n[Kyahaaaahk!?]\n[Kii!?]\n[Kiaaah!]\nIt was the most fearsome of the three, the one that had eaten Lee Shin Woo’s Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatsword and had absorbed its Countercurrent and Absorption abilities. However, it suddenly twisted its body in pain. At the same time, a portion of the dark flamesthat surrounded them collapsed, making it a lot easier for Jin to move around.\n\"I did it. Nice...!\"\n\"Wait. You’re the one doing that!?\"\n\"Just a little more...!\"\nLee Shin Woo’s body had also twisted atop Jin. However, the monster’s reaction had been far more intense. At first, it seemed to be twisting its body left and right, but now, it was knocking into the other Dark Flame Ghosts!\nIt couldn’t escape the underground, and its head and body moved in every direction. It resembled a balloon figure that wobbled around in front of a newly opened store.\n[Kiiiiik!]\n[Kihiiiiii!]\nThe other two Dark Flame Ghosts couldn’t hide their unease at the sudden onset of their comrade’s insanity. Even while getting hit here and there, they tried to communicate with their comrade in their language, but their comrade was completely out of it. It just screamed in pain and repeatedly tackled the other Dark Flame Ghosts!\nDue to the sudden internal conflict, the dark flameceased its advance, allowing Lee Shin Woo and Jin to rest. Although this was their best chance to attack, Lee Shin Woo continued to tightly squeeze his fist and focus on something. Seeing that, Jin finally got it.\n\"Shin Woo, are you using the bones to...?\"\n\"Yep.\"\nLee Shin Woo looked at the Dark Flame Ghosts and nodded his head. He was using none other than the Rule of Bone skill. He was controlling someone else’s bones; to be exact, he was controlling the Dark Flame Ghost’s newly acquired bone armor.\nEver since he fought the Beast General and learned of the Rule of Bone’s potential, he trained diligently. As a result, he was better able to meddle with another person’s bones, and in the end, he was able to control the Dark Flame Ghost’s bone armor and use it to control its movements!

Lee Shin Woo and Jin were left completely alone. That’s because the Dark Flame Ghosts knew that Lee Shin Woo and Jin wouldn’t be able to hurt them.\n’I had something ready, just in case they figured out I was the culprit and attacked me.’\nBut this made things a lot easier on them. Lee Shin Woo took a deep breath and then concentrated even harder. Honestly, this part was even more crucial.\n[Kyaaaaaaahk!]\n[Kihaaaaah!]\nThe Dark Flame Ghosts shot their dark flamesat their comrade. The Dark Flame Ghost under his control took the dark flamehead-on with its black armor and was able to mitigate the damage by absorbing it.\nThe magic reaction that arose from the collision between the dark flamesthey shot out and the dark flamesaround their armor... All those feelings were relayed to Lee Shin Woo. It was only natural, as it involved the bones he was controlling. In an instant, his understanding of the dark flameskyrocketed.\n’...Nice. Now I’m at the starting line.’\nLee Shin Woo smiled.\nThis battle had just begun.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 41 part4",
    "content": "<Chapter 41. The Second Advent of the Sun God - 4>\nLee Shin Woo reaffirmed that a level 8 dungeon was indeed amazing. Since the dungeon was still standing, despite those giant monsters twisting their bodies around and shaking the ground, the ceiling, and the walls!\nThe ground was especially impressive. These bugs, which possessed extraordinary strength, all groaned in agony, yet they couldn’t escape the floor; this was no longer a Cradle of Fire, but a prison.\n[Kishaahk!]\n[Kueiiiii!]\n[Kiaaaaah!]\nWhenever the monsters (covered in dark flames and being several meters tall) collided with one another, their black bone armor... no, their black armor would break and fly in every which direction. When their dark flames clashed, they would eat each other and disappear.\nIf it were a one-on-one battle, then the Dark Flame Ghost, which had eaten the Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatsword (in other words, the one Lee Shin Woo was controlling), would be in the lead, but it was fighting two against one right now. Neither side got any sort of lead; their dark flamessimply crashed against each other again and again and disappeared. This may not have been Lee Shin Woo’s intent, but either way, it was a complete stalemate.\n\"Good. I’ve gotten a lot better at controlling bone, so...\"\nIt would be nice if he could focus all his attention on studying the dark flame, but he had something he needed to do beforehand. He needed to collect the non-undead Dark Flame Ghost’s, or rather the Desert Ghost’s loot! Three level 8 elites had come rushing out after he’d beaten the Desert Ghost, so he hadn’t had the opportunity before.\nHe immediately checked the loot. He’d acquired the Desert Ghost’s head armor (in other words, the exoskeleton that enclosed its head), as well as a Flame Wind Bone Core.\n\"My stats are at 12,564 right now... I need 236 more to level up. Will I level up if I absorb the exoskeleton and the bone core? Still...\"\nAs its name implied, Lee Shin Woo felt a powerful energy consisting of both flame and wind from it. Of course, since it was now bone, he could absorb it.\nBut there was a reason he hesitated. It seemed to have high compatibility with the Titan Bone Core. He felt as though it could increase the Titan Bone Core’s maximum capacity. In other words, the amount of time he’d be able to use the Titan Bone Golem. Furthermore, it should also increase the golem’s performance as well.\n’...Then, I’ll save this for later. If I don’t level up, then I’ll use it.’\nIt couldn’t be helped; Lee Shin Woo absorbed the Desert Ghost’s head exoskeleton. Though not as much as the Flame Wind Core Bone, the exoskeleton retained a large volume of flames; the flames instantaneously spread throughout Lee Shin Woo’s body.\n[You have absorbed the Lv8 Elite Desert Ghost’s Head Exoskeleton. Strength has increased by 10, Health by 50, and Magic by 60. High Rank Fire has become Lv6, and High Rank Fire Resistance has become Lv5. Magic has increased by 40.]\n[Kugeugeuk. Gyaahk...! (I can’t... escape from here!) - Desert Ghost]\n\"Only 76 more stats until I level up... Huh? ...Huh!?\"\nOnce he was finished with the Bone Reinforcement, his body shook. Was it due to the sudden rise of his stats? Of course not. He was used to the feeling of his stats rising so sharply. He was just deep inside the Desert Ghost’s memories, feeling the depths of its fear and despair.\nIt was only after he finished going through its memories that he understood why they (the Dark Desert Ghosts) couldn’t leave the floor.\n\"Those guys... They’re trapped in a barrier.\"\n\"A barrier?\"\n\"Yeah. They’re animals, not trees; they can’t live in the ground. It wasn’t their original ecosystem.\"\nThey weren’t born to live like this. Their original names hadn’t even been ’Desert Ghost’. They were incredibly rare, parasitic insect monsters that originated from the Mantis Forest. Of course, they were very powerful for parasites, but they were only about level 5 before.\nHowever, their species had a unique trait... if even a portion of their body came into contact with something, they would be able to absorb their power, no matter what it was. They were captured because of the ’no matter what it was’ part, and were then trapped inside a barrier and forced to live here along with the ones that would become their ’host’.\nAlthough they couldn’t move properly, they continually sucked power and mana from their host. They continued this for hundreds of years. These parasites, which had once been level 5, had suffered so many years to become level 8 elites.\n\"Level 5 monsters becoming level 8 elites...\"\n\"Yeah. That just goes to show how impressive their host is.\"\n\"So their host is down below, huh. Then can’t we just let them be and just leave!?\"\n\"I’d like to, but...\"\nThe one who’d put the parasites into this position probably didn’t do this to torment them, but to weaken their would-be host. Their barriers were also meant to disallow the parasites’ host from escaping.\nThe exact function of the barrier was... to ’disallow any living being from escaping’. Lee Shin Woo was quite familiar with that type of barrier.\n\"In other words, this barrier was created by the Magic Emperor. The Emperor from hundreds of years ago. He may even be the Crown Prince who chased out the 2nd prince. He could also be a past or future generation too.\"\n\"Then is this a passageway that connects to the underground?\"\n\"If we were to force our way through, then yeah, we’d probably get to the Underground Empire, but it’s not an official passageway. If the Underground Empire’s at the very bottom, then there’s a stratum above it, and the dungeon’s underground is above that... The undead curse gradually moved up and managed to affect the underground part of this dungeon.\"\nThe barrier here and the barrier in the Underground Empire were strangely different. Not only was its purpose different, but its function was different as well. Since the barrier was created for the sole purpose of trapping the parasites’ host.\nIf that’s the case, then why did they waste time and set up a new barrier? The answer was quite simple. The Magic Emperor wasn’t powerful enough to move these monsters into the Underground Empire. It seemed like these monsters had originally lived here, and they’d never left ever since.\n\"They left a bomb right next to the capital.\"\n\"On the contrary, they did it because it was close to the capital.\"\nThat bastard (the Magic Emperor) was afraid that these parasites would harm his Empire, so he’d left them here and cast a barrier to prevent them from leaving.\nIn exchange for its limited scope, the barrier was much more powerful than the Underground Empire’s barrier. The most representative feature of this barrier was that ’the one trapped within the barrier cannot move’.\nHowever, the parasites were already connected to their host, so even if they couldn’t move, they could still suck them dry. The Emperor had probably set it up that way.\n\"Wait a sec. The fact that they’re moving so much now, when they’re not supposed to be able to means...\"\n\"Yep. They were able to escape the barrier by becoming undead.\"\nWhile its main feature was to prevent the living from escaping, it had several other functions as well, so the parasites couldn’t leave immediately, even after becoming undead. However, they had cleared the most limiting condition. If Lee Shin Woo hadn’t come here, then the barrier would’ve broken before long.\n’Why was the first one we took down not undead...?’ he wondered. This was just a hypothesis, but perhaps the barrier had loosened as the undead versions rampaged about, allowing the still living bugs to escape as well.\n\"...Then, Shin Woo. What if the host has turned undead as well?\"\n\"Mm... Yeah. If they’ve become undead as well, then they’ll be able to break through that barrier soon.\"\nJin asked, and Lee Shin Woo smiled and agreed. Then, he sighed and gazed at the distant Dark Flame Ghosts, while adding something disturbing.\n\"They may be sucking their host’s strength, but the host’s level remains the same. If all goes well, then as they become undead, they may regain a portion of the powers they’ve lost. Plus, if these guys rampage on the surface, then the undead curse will begin to spread across the Magic Empire in earnest. At that time, the Emperor will have no choice but to intervene personally.\"\n\"The situation’s this bad, yet the Emperor’s not doing anything. What do you think he’s doing?\"\n\"I wonder. I want to know too.\"\nEither the previous Emperor’s transition of power didn’t go smoothly, so the current Emperor didn’t know the current state of affairs regarding the dungeon, or... No, no matter how stupid he was, there’s no way he could not know. The 12 generals are still managing the dungeon, so he knew about the danger it presented.\nBut he was bothered by how passive the Emperor’s approach to the problem was. It was possible that his subordinates had reported that the threat of the trapped monsters had gone down. He might even think the same regarding the undead curse, that it wasn’t a big deal.\n’But it pisses me off that this is all just an assumption. As I thought, I have to see the Emperor in person.’\nThen, what would he need to do to see the Emperor on short notice? His solution was quite simple. If he killed all of the monsters trapped here, then they would have to summon him to the palace! Honestly, he didn’t really have any other choice.\n\"If we don’t kill them here and now, then the surface will be ruined. It’d be nice if they hurt some of the Emperor’s forces, but the innocent civilians would be hurt the most.\"\n\"I have no idea whether you’re a nice guy or an evil bastard. You say you want to save the innocent, but there are probably some innocent people in the Emperor’s forces as well.\"\n\"But they’re prepared to die as part of the military. Moreover, I don’t really care whether I’m called a good guy or not. We’ve settled everything and come to the surface, but I don’t want to live in a place where all that exists are the undead.\"\nHe wasn’t going to be hypocritical. Lee Shin Woo spoke and then looked over the bugs. Their black armor was in tatters, but the binding power was still as strong as ever. To be exact, their health and magic had decreased enough that the reduced binding power of their armor was enough.\nLee Shin Woo explained the situation to Jin and organized his thoughts; meanwhile the bugs continued to fight desperately. His analysis of the dark flame continued to increase.\n’As I thought, the dark flamecan’t be created just because you have both the fire and darkness element. Because they originally had the ability to absorb energy, they were able to fuse the fire and darkness elements and create this new element.’\nIn other words, whether it was acquired or an innate ability, a fusion element required a ’seed’ of power that befitted the fusion element; only by having that could one create a fusion element. This information was incredibly important to Lee Shin Woo.\nAnd what conclusion did he come to?\n\"Dark flames... If all goes well, I might be able to make them too.\"\n\"Heok!? That monstrous ability!? Plus, that name’s kind of childish.\"\n\"I can’t do anything about that...\"\nHe possessed the Bone Reinforcement ability and Absorption abilities, so he already had the seed. Moreover, he’d already experienced the real thing. The feelings relayed by the bone armor were so clear that he felt like his body would be sucked into the dark flames.\n’Could I fuse other elements as well? I’d like to acquire them before I fight that guy hidden inside... In any case, I have to focus on the dark flame.’\nHe thought distressingly, but created darkness and fire in each hand nonetheless. While the pitiful bugs continued to fight amongst each other, Lee Shin Woo thought deeply, bringing all his abilities to the surface and focusing on learning a new element.\n[The High Rank Mana Bone skill has become Lv6.

The Second Advent of the Sun God - 5>\nFollowing Lee Shin Woo’s entrance, the Sun God religion’s Pope and the Evileye General, Shurina Von Hegel were oddly confronting each other in front of the dungeon. The Pope was worried that the Emperor was meddling with Lee Shin Woo through the 12 generals, and the Evileye General was also suspicious of Lee Shin Woo’s sudden appearance.\nNeither side could voice such doubts first, but even so, they couldn’t hide all their negative feelings. It had been a full day since they set up camp, and as the second day passed, the mood became even worse.\n\"Your Holiness!\"\nBoth sides seemed almost ready to fight against each other, but the wounded paladins and priests had then come out of the dungeon and cooled everyone down. Even the Pope was surprised with their haggard and disheveled appearance; their equipment was riddled with holes.\n\"What’s going on!? W-What happened to Kay!?\"\n\"Sir Kay is fine! But the dungeon...!\"\nAn uninjured priest reported whilst shaking. The priest looked like he couldn’t believe what he himself was saying.\n\"It turned into a level 8 dungeon...!\"\n\"What!? No matter how strong Kay is, a level 8 dungeon is...!\"\n\"What did you say!?\"\nThe Pope yelled in shock. The Evileye General listening in from the side was likewise shocked. A level 7 dungeon was already classified as a national disaster, yet the dungeon’s level had risen even further! Ultimately, she yelled at the Pope.\n\"Now what are you going to do!? By recklessly entering the dungeon, the ’Sun God’s hero’ made the dungeon even more dangerous!\"\n\"What idiocy. Man cannot change a dungeon. It’s simply assuming its true form! On the contrary, it’s because of Kay that we’ve figured out how dangerous the dungeon truly is; yet, instead of thanking him, you want to shift all the blame onto him? Is this how the 12 generals do things? Is this how...\"\n\"Enough!\"\nThe Evileye General knew what he would say next. He had wanted to say, ’Is this how the Empire does things?’ He was trying to insult the Emperor! Capital punishment wouldn’t be enough for his crime!\n\"The dungeon was dormant! If he hadn’t gone into the dungeon, then it would’ve remained peaceful!\"\n\"...Do you really think that? Have you never studied the basics (of dungeons)? I suppose being one of the 12 generals isn’t all that. Isn’t that so?\"\n\"Eek...\"\nNonetheless, the Pope remained relaxed and replied whilst snorting, and the Evileye General, who’d wanted to retort, was speechless.\nOf course she’d be. The fact that the 12 generals took shifts to watch over the dungeon meant that the word ’peaceful’ didn’t apply to it.\nThey knew that something would go wrong eventually, but because they didn’t have enough manpower available, they put forth a stopgap measure instead of a proper one. In a way, the Magic Empire had brought this on themselves.\n\"Before you ask the Sun God religion to pay for its crimes, get the Emperor to apologize to all the citizens.\"\n\"That doesn’t matter right now. We need to do something about the level 8 dungeon!\"\n\"Ha. That was my original intention, but... I guess you’re finally open to a constructive conversation.\"\n\"Keuk...!\"\nThe Pope watched as the Evileye General bit her lower lip in humiliation, and snorted once more. However, he wasn’t actually feeling that great.\nHe came out strongly, so that the blame wouldn’t be shifted onto the Sun God religion, but he couldn’t help being worried about Lee Shin Woo, who was trapped inside the dungeon. Lee Shin Woo was the Sun God religion’s treasure, as well as the link between him and the Lawrence shop. There was so much more he had to do, so he couldn’t lose him here.\n\"...Report this matter to the Emperor in person. Kay is strong, but he can’t clear a level 8 dungeon all on his own. If the other 12 generals are busy and cannot intervene, then you must get the Emperor to take action. The Empire’s in danger. Do you understand?\"\n\"Who’s fault do you think this is... I understand. I was going to report this matter to His Majesty, anyway!\"\nThe Evileye General tried to keep what was left of her pride, but the Pope had become so serious that she couldn’t maintain eye contact and just went along with what he said.\nThe Sun God religion may be weak, but the Pope was always someone others couldn’t look down upon. Compared to other religious orders, where the Pope was selected based on support, irrespective of level, the Pope of the Sun God religion was a priest who could control powerful flames from a young age and was a hero who had single-handedly rebuilt the declining Sun God religion!\nIn terms of both power and resolve, the Sun God religion’s Pope was far greater than the other religious orders’ popes. He had brought his order a young hero who would bring the order to new heights, so if Lee Shin Woo survived the dungeon, then the Sun God religion would soon be known as the most respectable religion in the land!\n’But if that happens, it could harm the Emperor’s reputation. Kay has to die no matter what...! We have to stop the level 8 dungeon’s countercurrent, but I think we could wait until he dies first!’\nOf course, the Pope mostly knew what she was thinking. He saw her call her soldiers over and secretly give them orders, so he clicked his tongue and called for the priests on standby. If that’s how she was going to play, then he would respond in earnest. He already had something up his sleeve.\n\"Relay this news to the Great God, Merciful God, and Living God religious orders as soon as possible. There are things that we should tell them, but also things that we should hide. Do you understand what I’m saying?\"\n\"I understand, Your Holiness. Then I’ll get going immediately!\"\nThe relation between the Sun God religion and all the other religious orders wasn’t good. However, when they fought against a common enemy, then they would prove to be the most trustworthy of allies. And if something this big was going on, then...\n’I’d rather not let them in on our pie, but it’s not worth trading our hero for it.’\nOnce the Pope and the Evileye General were finished taking appropriate measures, they looked at each other more menacingly than before. Then, the dungeon began to vibrate greatly. To be exact, the clashes within the dungeon had surpassed the dungeon’s ability to contain them, and were thus affecting the outside world as well.\n\"Oh my god. The entrance to the dungeon has collapsed.\"\n\"This mana I feel from within the dungeon... Wait a second. Isn’t this an undead’s mana...?\"\nThe Pope furrowed his brow. He knew about the disaster that was befalling the Underground Empire. It hadn’t spread to the surface yet, but the undead had appeared in the dungeons halfway underground.\n’I knew this would happen; the underground curse still hasn’t been taken care of it.’\nDozens of years ago, each temple had been given an oracle. An oracle telling them to elect a hero to purify the undead curse.\nAt the time, the Emperor and the religious orders selected heroes and dispatched them to the Underground Empire. He hadn’t heard of them ever coming back, but he remembered the Emperor saying that ’the curse has been taken care of, and that the barrier is as perfect as ever’. The Pope hadn’t believed him, but he’d thought that the Emperor had something ready just in case... But considering what was happening now, it seemed like he didn’t.\n’Emperor. What exactly are you hoping for? How long are you going to stay on the sidelines and just watch? Do you really want us to all die together?’\nHe wouldn’t leave them to die. Their country was recognized as an Empire because of its citizens, not the Emperor. The Emperor would soon realize. No, he would make him realize.\n’To do that, you need to stay alive, Kay. Prove to me that I wasn’t mistaken about you...!’\nAt that moment, Lee Shin Woo, the main topic of conversation, ignored the wailing bugs before him... and was at a loss.\n[You have learned the fusion element, Beginner Dark Shadow! You succeeded in fusing the characteristics of shadow, which cannot become an element, with darkness to create a fusion element. Magic has increased by 20!]\n[A shadow is hidden within the darkness, and looks as though it is not there. However, it most certainly exists. When the world is unable to differentiate the two, the shadow can then mishmash all cause and effect. This element could only be created by you, who possess the Joker’s karma, and contains the power of ’reversal’. This element will show its true worth when used in conjunction with the Joker’s innate skills.]\n[By recognizing the other facets of darkness, you should be able to acquire a new element.]\n\"Oh.\"\nThat’s strange. This wasn’t what he was going for. He wasn’t trying to acquire Dark Shadow, but Dark Flame!\nLee Shin Woo was flustered at the unforeseen situation. He had familiarized himself with the essence and structure of the dark flame, and knew, for the most part, how to create the element. There was plenty of the real thing in front of him, and he had tried his best to fuse fire and darkness, yet... Yet!\n’So does that mean Bone Reinforcement and Absorption won’t cut it?’\nThat was his one miscalculation. The parasites had gained the dark flames, as they possessed the ability to suck energy from their host; Lee Shin Woo had thought he could replicate those flames, as he possessed abilities similar to theirs. But at that point, Lee Shin Woo had already failed.\nWhat influenced the creation of fusion elements was less about the skills and more about one’s fundamental characteristics. Meaning it was related to one’s class karma. For Lee Shin Woo, it was similar to his Joker karma!\n’Dark Shadow, huh.’\nHe had attempted to fuse darkness and fire together, but in the process, he had cast a shadow with his fire and fused the resulting shadow with his darkness element. The necessary knowledge, the proper state of mind, and his magic was factored in, and he managed to acquire a fusion element. After all, ’even a blind pig can find an acorn once in a while’. [1]\n\"It’s not half bad.\"\n\"No matter how I look at it, it’s much more dangerous than the dark flame!\"\n\"But it’s much harder to use than the dark flame. I’ve got one more thing I have to practice from now on.\" Chapters fırst released on NoveI[F]ire.net\nAnd... Lee Shin Woo raised his head. The battle among the three Dark Flame Ghosts had gradually intensified, and the one Lee Shin Woo had been controlling was now covered in wounds.\nEverything that happened from now would be crucial. Even now, the resistance of the ’host’ below was fierce, and contrary to the dying Dark Flame Ghost, the other two seemed to be in good condition. If he didn’t take them down in the proper order, then the situation may become too much for him to deal with. If that’s the case, then...\n\"Alright. You’ve done well.\"\n[Guiiiiiik!]\nLee Shin Woo clenched his fist towards the Dark Flame Ghost he’d been controlling. Then, its armor sprouted sharp spears and tore through its rotten flesh. Jin predicted what would happen next.\n\"Explode!\"\n[Kyaaaaaaaaaahk!]\nAs expected! The thorn armor, which had pierced through its entire body (from the tip of its head to the bottom of its feet), exploded! It was exhausted due to the battle, so there was no way it’d be able to survive the explosion. It let out a death throe and finally found peace.\n\"I wasn’t rewarded yet. I guess it’s because I haven’t resolved the situation.\"\nOnce it died, he snatched the midair loot and grinned. By killing one of the three, the barrier began to shake even more than before, and the remaining two Dark Flame Ghosts looked at him and couldn’t hide their unease. They still weren’t able to remove their bone armor.\n\"Wait just a little while longer, kids.\"\n[Kiiiik...]\n[Giguk, guiik...!]\nLee Shin Woo controlled the bone armor, immobilizing the Dark Flame Ghosts (while they were fighting amongst themselves, Lee Shin Woo had been analyzing them and as a result, could halt their movements with much less effort than before), and looked over the bone in his hand.\nIt was entirely jet-black and unassuming, but he sensed an extraordinary energy within.\n\"Let’s get to level 8 before we fight the boss.\"\nHe used Bone Reinforcement without hesitating, absorbing the rib bone that the pitiful Dark Flame Ghost had left behind.\n[1] T/N: \"An incompetent person or an unsystematic approach is bound to succeed every now and then by chance.\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 41. The Second Advent of the Sun God - 6>\n[Absorbing the Lv8 Fiery Sand’s Dark Flame Ghost’s rib bone. Strength has increased by 40, Agility by 5, Health by 50, and Magic by 80. You have acquired the fusion element, Intermediate Dark Flame Lv1 and Magic has increased by 50. The High Rank Regeneration skill has become Lv5, and Health and Magic have increased by 20. The Absorption skill has become Lv12 and Magic has increased by 40.]\n[As the Dark Flame is an innate skill that belongs to a different karma, you cannot advance the skill any higher than the intermediate level.]\nOnce he absorbed the bone, Lee Shin Woo thought, ’as expected’. Giving him a ton of stats was great, but it was nothing to write home about.\nHe was more concerned about the fusion element he’d obtained. Lee Shin Woo understood the basis behind it, as well as its structure; even though he should’ve had everything he needed, he wasn’t able to learn the fusion element with his own efforts. Yet, by absorbing the Dark Flame Ghost’s bone, he was able to gain the element without a hitch!\n’I should’ve taken a hint. Since the Joker’s karma allows me to imitate any and all karma. Although it’s an innate element that I can’t learn myself, I can still acquire it through Bone Reinforcement. It’s disappointing that I can’t get it past the intermediate level, but... this is good enough.’\nIt had been such a long time since he’d seen the message (informing him of his own limitations) that he actually felt happy.\nLee Shin Woo had rebuilt all his skills, allowing him to break their limits and develop them further, but the Dark Flame was heterogeneous and was already a completed element. Therefore, he couldn’t break through the intermediate limitation imposed on the skill. Even so, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t going to give up here. He already had a way of using the Dark Flame at a level higher than intermediate.\n\"But right now, this takes priority.\"\nOnce he’d absorbed the Dark Flame Ghost’s bone, he felt his body teeming with mana. He wasn’t stupid enough to not know what this meant. He was leveling up.\n\"Huh? Do you want me to just keep all this other stuff?\"\n\"In your inventory. Thanks.\"\nHe gave Jin the Titan Bone Core and the two other Bone Cores just in case; he didn’t want them to be absorbed while he was leveling up. Absorbing the Heaven Door’s Key would only benefit him, so he kept it on his person. However, it probably wouldn’t go his way. Since he didn’t even know how it worked yet.\nAfter that, he distanced himself from Jin. And how did he distance himself from Jin? Using wind mana to propel himself into the air and float. He could float with ease by slightly changing the appearance of his level 7 cape, the Prayer of the Dead.\n\"Hey, you can fly yourself, so why did you make me do it!?\"\n\"You’re way faster and you look way cooler. And it makes it easier for me to concentrate on the battle.\"\n\"Youuuuuuu!\"\nIt was obvious when you think about it. Lee Shin Woo had already given him all the gear he needed to fly, and so long as he properly controlled it, he could fly as much as he wanted. Then, why wouldn’t Lee Shin Woo be able to fly, when he could use the Disguise skill that allowed him to imitate anything and everything? Whoever doubted his ability to fly was the strange one, not the other way around!\nBut Lee Shin Woo calmly asked Jin to do something for him, even though Jin was so pissed.\n\"Cover me while I’m leveling up.\"\n\"Wait, right now? What about them?\"\n\"They won’t be able to move for the time being. Watch for any other monsters that may come.\"\nThere existed other monsters within the level 8 dungeon aside from the Dark Flame Ghosts and their host. All sorts of monsters gathered, due to the immense energy the dungeon was emitting; of these remaining monsters, most of them were monsters like the Solar Scarabs.\nBut the level 8 Dark Flame Ghosts’ rampage had prevented them from coming out; even if they did, they would be immediately vaporized, so Lee Shin Woo hadn’t had to fight against such weak mobs.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo was preventing the two Dark Flame Ghosts from moving, so it wouldn’t be strange for the monsters laying in wait to come for them now.\n\"While you’re at it, pick up the level 8 bones on the floor too. I’ll let you absorb all of them. You need to get to level 8 too.\"\n\"Yay, I’m so happy...\"\nWith a teary face, Jin nodded his head and accepted the request. Then, Lee Shin Woo let go of the rampaging mana within him so he could proceed with the level up.\nEven though the wind mana disappeared, his body naturally remained afloat. His body was covered in a deep darkness and soon, the surrounding environment was stained in darkness.\nHe never needed Jin’s protection. At this very moment, no one would be able to find Lee Shin Woo, nor would they be able to attack him. It was similar to Metafel Rerdan’s invincibility state when he was leveling up.\n[You were able to comprehend your karma with no one to teach you, and have repeatedly grown to suit this achievement. Ultimately, you have managed to create a low level innate element, which cannot be classified as mere karma; instead, it can be considered a revolution that came about from who you are.]\n[Your worth cannot be measured by what your body is made of nor what you create. Since you can fabricate it all and forge reality.]\n[You have finally reached the essence of the Joker karma. For now, you must borrow the power of darkness and shadow that obscures the line among all creation to do this. But if you manage to overcome this obstacle, then you will become a true Joker.]\n[You have evolved into a Level 8 Shadow Joker.]\nLee Shin Woo had somewhat expected this to happen, as he had gained a deeper understanding of his Disguise skill. He would eventually overcome the limitations of life and death, and even overcome the limits of all creation. He knew he would be reborn and that the only term that could describe him would be a ’concept’.\nAs evidence, he had overcome the livings’ limitation of ’breathing’; moreover, he’d overcome the limitation of the undead: ’bones’. He hadn’t lost them. He had transcended them. Lee Shin Woo could do so at any time, and there was no need for him to obsess over them anymore.\nNow he didn’t need to breathe to dominate his surroundings. From now on, he just needed to color the world with his shadow. That was the authority of a level 8... No, it was a high rank authority that only Lee Shin Woo had reached.\n’There’s only one step left.’\nHe was lucky. If he hadn’t acquired the innate element before he’d leveled up, then he would’ve had a long road ahead of him. But he was able to learn of the fusion element within the dungeon, and was able to study an element that harmonized with one’s unique characteristics.\nDark Shadow, which reversed cause and effect, was capable of switching one between life and death; human or the undead. He couldn’t right this instant, but if he trained, he was sure that he would be able to one day. His class as Shadow Joker had made this clear.\n[You now have a deeper understanding of the Darkness element. High Rank Darkness has become Lv7 and Magic has increased by 40. You have gained a fundamental understanding of darkness and absorb the level 7 artifact, ’Everlasting Night’.]\n\"Oh.\"\nHe thought he’d finally finished his level up, but he heard a message in his ear. Lee Shin Woo was extremely flustered, as he hadn’t expected this to happen.\nIt was the bracelet he’d gotten off of Ethan Cruz, the level 7 bracelet, Everlasting Night. It sharply increased the potency of one’s darkness magic, but he hadn’t been able to change it into bone thus far, so he’d equipped it and forgotten all about it. However, he hadn’t thought he’d be able to absorb it through his understanding of the Darkness element, rather than through Bone Reinforcement!\n’Is this what it means when they say that every stream and wave goes to the sea and becomes one?’\nTo be honest, he didn’t really know. However, he did know it wouldn’t result in anything bad, so he let it be.\nThis level up felt truly bizarre. First off, he didn’t feel any pain whatsoever. It felt as though his entire being was melting into the darkness. Yeah, as if this is what was supposed to happen from the very beginning.\nThe Everlasting Night did the same; it melted into him and they became one.\n[Absorbing the Lv7 Everlasting Night. Magic has increased by 150. The Mana Acceleration skill has become Lv7 and Magic has increased by 10. The High Rank Mana Bone skill has become Lv7 and Magic has increased by 30. High Rank Darkness has become Lv10 and has reached the MAX level. Magic has increased by 260. You have gained the title, ’He Who Has Reached the Peak’. All stats have increased by 50.]\nIn the process of absorbing the Everlasting Night, Lee Shin Woo had finally reached the summit of his darkness element. It was only natural when he thought about it. Lee Shin Woo was born as a skeleton, so he had a high affinity with darkness at birth. Thus, it made sense that the first element that he mastered was the Darkness element.\nSince he had reached its peak, he no longer needed the Everlasting Night’s amplification ability. He definitely came out ahead if he were to weigh the pros and cons. Because he’d absorbed the artifact’s abilities completely, his Mana Acceleration and Mana Bone skills had leveled up, despite them just recently doing so. He was happy about that. Of course, his evolution hadn’t stopped there.\n[The High Rank Assimilation skill has become Lv5. Agility and Magic have increased by 30.]\nIt made sense that Assimilation leveled up too. Since the Assimilation skill didn’t just refer to his assimilation with Jin, but his assimilation of the world as a whole.\nHe understood the darkness and himself better, so he could now melt into the world; therefore, his Assimilation had leveled up. Perhaps Assimilation was far greater than Lee Shin Woo had imagined. He was really happy when he thought it might be connected to his Joker karma.\n[The High Rank Combat Sense skill has become Lv6. Agility has increased by 40.]\nConversely, his Combat Sense skill had leveled up for a more simple reason. His senses had improved dramatically compared to before, so his skill had followed suit and leveled up. Stats were one of the best indicators of one’s combat ability, so with this, he could tell just how much he’d grown.\nBut then, a wave came crashing down that would prove incomparable to his Combat Sense’s growth. He had understood the Joker’s essence, reached the peak of the Darkness element, had awakened the Dark Shadow element, and had become a level 8... Because he had become so much more, he was able to attain this new skill! Read complete versıon only at novęlfire.net\n[The High Rank Bursting Thunder, Thorn Shadow, Emergency Evasion, High Rank Lightning Sprint, and Lightning Shadow skills are fusing together and evolving.]\nAll of the combat skills he’d acquired thus far had fused together and filled his body. It was no mere combat skill; it felt as though a new weapon and armor was made for him that suited his existence.\nIt had overcome the limitation of passive and active skills, and had become a skill that would create a new stage where he could contain and reveal all.\nCould he even call that a skill? He only called it a skill because he didn’t know anything that would be appropriate. In fact, he could call it his alter ego.\n[You have learned the innate skill, Wild Card Lv1. All stats have increased by 200.]\nOnce he’d gained the skill of skills, Lee Shin Woo smiled within the darkness.\nWild Card? That was the very essence of a Joker.",

His skills grew, which resulted in a noticeable increase in his stats as well. He’d just become level 8, yet his stats totaled 14,679.\nMoreover, by becoming level 8, his status effectiveness had increased, so even he wasn’t sure how much stronger he’d gotten. Although his growth rate was lower now than when he had leveled up from level 6 to level 7, he had gained an overwhelming authority in its place, so he didn’t have any complaints. As the message said, it would be nigh impossible for other level 8s to gain this much power.\n’And I feel it too. That I won’t lose to anyone I’ve met anymore.’\nHe recalled the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin, yet he didn’t feel tense. When he was level 7, he’d set the groundwork to countering the Archmage’s spatial magic. And now that he’d learned the Dark Shadow element and had reached level 8, he was confident that he could counter his spatial magic completely. If he were to factor in the dark flames as well... Wait, the dark flames?\n\"Ah, that’s right.\"\nHe knew he was forgetting something. Lee Shin Woo stopped ruminating and got to work. The dense darkness was condensed into a single point, giving his body its shape. It’d be fine if he looked like a skeleton, but he decided to assume a human form, just in case the dungeon collapsed and they were exposed.\n\"Hoo.\"\nHe appeared as a young man with a fit body and a tall height, causing him to emit a sort of decadent appeal. His body was much more ’balanced’ than when he was on Earth, but it was only natural when he took into account the transcendent growth in his stats.\nHe could make himself look like this with the Disguise skill, but making this form from darkness resulted in a way more lifelike feeling.\n\"I don’t even need to use Disguise anymore. Is this what happens when the world automatically overlaps the frame of ’a living person’ onto one’s essence? Interesting...\"\nOf course, it was because of the Disguise skill that he was able to awaken, so he shouldn’t be worrying about the differences between the two abilities. All of his abilities made up who he was. ’Perhaps I’ve achieved enlightenment,’ Lee Shin Woo uselessly thought, and equipped himself through Bone Armory.\nHe couldn’t yet, but if he were to transcend Bone Reinforcement, Rule of Bone, and Bone Armory... his skills related to bones, then Lee Shin Woo would be ’complete’, or so he thought. He’d already transcended his previous physical form, so now he had to transcend his current abilities.\n\"Shin Woo!\"\n\"Yeah, thanks for covering me.\"\nOnce he became visible, Jin flew through the air and approached him. Lee Shin Woo replied nonchalantly, accepting the Titan Bone Core and the two Bone Cores, but Jin’s expression didn’t look too bright.\n\"That’s not the issue here. You look completely...\"\n\"Ah, let’s talk about that later.\"\n\"...Ok.\"\nAs expected, Jin also felt something after witnessing Lee Shin Woo’s evolution. Did he find out that he could transform into a human? If he did, then Lee Shin Woo would have to apologize until Jin cooled off. But there was something more pressing at the moment.\n\"Bone Reinforcement.\"\nLee Shin Woo said softly and tightened his grip. Darkness leaked from his fingertips, enveloping the Titan Bone Core and the two Bone Cores. The Titan Bone Core and the two other cores lost their shape and fused together; they were forming into a completely different shape.\nWhen he leveled up, his ’existence’ changed completely, so all of his skills underwent fundamental growth, not just his Wild Card skill. If they hadn’t, then the completed Bone Core probably wouldn’t be rebuilt.\n[Kyaaaaahk...!]\n[Kihik!]\n\"Sorry, but you’ll have to stick with me for a little bit longer... Heup!\"\nThe Titan Bone Core was still evolving. He gripped the darkness in one hand and extended his other hands to the groaning Dark Flame Ghosts, who were trapped in their armor. Then, they surprisingly started to escape upwards!\n[Kyahak!?]\n[Kiiiiiiiiii!]\nLee Shin Woo reinforced their bone armor by infusing his magic into them, allowing him to control them more easily. Then, the Dark Flame Ghosts escaped the barrier, even though they hadn’t been able to do so by themselves!\n\"Now’s not the time to be fighting amongst ourselves! Get a hold of yourselves!\"\n[Giiiiiiik!]\nHe’d been the one egging them on, so it didn’t sound right coming from him. However, Lee Shin Woo’s expression didn’t waver. Was he not going to instigate them now? This was a complete 180!\nJin looked disapprovingly at him (that’s what his goblin fire seemed to convey at least) and Lee Shin Woo whispered.\n\"Jin, we’ll be fighting the true boss soon. Bear with it until I get on the Titan. I’ll take care of the rest once I’ve gotten on.\"\n\"Those bugs are still there, yet you want to call the host!? Are you going to try and fool them? You can’t even talk to them.\"\n\"It’s because those bugs are there that I’m attempting to call the boss. And I don’t need to fool them. You’ll see.\"\nJin was confused. Lee Shin Woo clicked his tongue and raised his hand even higher. The sound of something rupturing sounded throughout the clearing. Immediately after, a ridiculous amount of fire surged from under the ground. The Dark Flame Ghosts had moved so forcefully that the barrier had been completely broken!\n[Kuaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\n[Giiiiiiiik!]\n[Gueeek!]\nA frightening amount of fire shook the clearing. The Dark Flame Ghosts began to shake when they heard those cries. Lee Shin Woo didn’t concern himself with their reactions and used more of his strength to completely pull them out from the ground.\nThe sight of the giant Dark Flame Ghosts unable to resist and being forced into the air was slightly adorable.\n\"Holy crap... Shin Woo...\"\n[Kuoooooooh!]\nOnce a part of the barrier cracked, the rest of it gave way quickly. Ultimately, the flames surging from under the ground burnt away the remains of the barrier.\nThough they were far away, the surging golden flames momentarily obscured their vision. It was such that Lee Shin Woo couldn’t completely shield himself from the sight with his darkness. In other words...\n[Kuhaaaaaaaah!]\n\"That’s...\"\nJin shook at its overwhelming presence. On the other hand, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t very surprised, as he’d felt it before. It crowed as it flew, its feathers, composed of golden flames, rising into the sky.\n[Lv9 Corrupted Garuda - Sun God]\n\"If the Pope knew about this, then he’d grasp his forehead. Since he’d have to remake all the stone statues of the Sun God.\"\n\"Now’s not the time to be joking around! If it’s corrupted, then that means it’s in the same condition as those Dryads!\" Thıs content belongs to novel•ﬁre.net\n\"Yeah, you’re right. It’d be great if we can return it to its original state, but... Man, that thing’s ruined.\"\nLee Shin Woo assumed that it was once covered in gold, but as of now, its body was a mix between a murky gold and black; he looked down at the giant divine bird and shrugged his shoulders.\nIt looked like it had avoided a complete undead transformation, but it wasn’t alive; there was even less of a chance of him restoring its intellect. At least, that’s what he saw.\n\"Its soul is rotten. ...Well, it must’ve gone through a lot, so it makes sense.\"\n\"Shin Woo, let’s run. We can’t beat that thing. Let’s let it rampage on the surface and hope it kills the Emperor for us.\"\n[He’s right. That’s... Not something a living being can oppose. Its existence borders on myth! As a spirit, I can tell. Only by transcending the barrier of the living and spirits can you gain that form!]\nNow that he thought about it, he’d completely forgotten about Zenon. While he was evolving, he had unsummoned his greatsword and Zenon was released; he had been hiding all this time. Lee Shin Woo called him to his side and soothed him.\n\"It’s ok. We don’t need to fight right away. Let’s just watch for now.\"\n[Huh?]\nThe Garuda was slowly coming up and getting closer and closer to them. However, Lee Shin Woo remained relaxed. Zenon wondered why he was so confident, but he soon got his answer. The Dark Flame Ghosts were free falling towards the Garuda.\n[Kyaaaaaaah!]\n[Kihaaaah!]\n\"Good. Let go of your anger!\"\n\"They’re not letting go of their anger. You’re letting go of them.\"\nJin calmly retorted, but that really wasn’t very important to Lee Shin Woo. Lee Shin Woo would be happy as long as the Dark Flame Ghosts and the Garuda fought!\nJin had thought that Lee Shin Woo would convince the Dark Flame Ghosts to fight against the Garuda, but he never needed to do so. If he left the three together, then...!\n[Kuaaaaaaaah!]\nThe Garuda noticed the Dark Flame Ghosts and furiously spewed flames. The flames were so great that the sides of the clearing walls exploded; part of the walls were simultaneously vaporized. The Dark Flame Ghosts had been drawing energy from the Garuda for years, so it was seething in anger!\n[Giiiiiiiii!]\n[Guaaahk!]\nOf course, the Dark Flame Ghosts were quite pitiful. They were brought here and sealed by the Magic Emperor, and had no choice but to draw energy from the Garuda to survive!\nBut so long as it was hostile towards them, the Dark Flame Ghosts had no choice but to use their dark flames in order to survive! And so, the battle between the level 9 bird and the two giant level 8 bugs began. Lee Shin Woo watched from above with Jin and Zenon and stuck his chest out boastingly.\n\"See that? A swindler controls cause and effect, even while doing nothing.\"\n\"Yeah, you’re amazing.\"\n\"That golden flame is either High Rank Fire or fire mixed with something else (a fusion element). I’m sure of it, considering the fact that the dark flames aren’t very effective against it. ...Based on the info I’m getting from the black armor, the only reason they’re lasting so long is because of the dark flames.\"\nBut there was a pronounced difference in physical specs, so the battle would end at this rate.\nRather than entering the battle himself, Lee Shin Woo reinforced their black armor further by infusing more magic into them. He increased their defense as much as he could and was trying to draw out as much of the Garuda’s power as possible.\n\"Those guys... Do you think they can win?\"\n\"Nope.\"\nJin asked cautiously and Lee Shin Woo firmly replied.\n\"On the contrary, the true battle will begin after they die.\"\nHe smiled as he looked at the still-evolving darkness within his grasp.\nWhen those Dark Flame Ghosts had done their job and turned into Bone Cores, the Titan Bone Core would finally be reborn into the state that Lee Shin Woo envisioned. The Titan Bone Core would inherit the Dark Flame Ghosts’ will and strength and be reborn. He would then ride the reborn Titan Bone Golem to defeat this foe. There was nothing more wonderful than this!\n\"I’m glad that you’re still the Lee Shin Woo that I’m used to, even after leveling up to level 8.\"\n\"...\"\nThat’s strange. Jin hadn’t insulted him at all, yet he felt unpleasant for some reason. As the battle continued, Lee Shin Woo wondered whether Jin had learned a skill like Instigate while he wasn’t looking.",

    "content": "<Chapter 41. The Second Advent of the Sun God - 8>\n[Kiiiiiiik!]\n[Kihiiii!]\n[Kuooooooooh!]\nTen minutes after the monsters, which boasted a height of at least 50 meters, began their decisive battle, Lee Shin Woo was able to give the Garuda’s golden flames a proper name.\n\"Let’s call that shining flame.\"\n\"It’s just as chunibyou as your dark flame.\"\n\"No, that’s not the issue here. It’s the fact that it’s the counter element to Dark Shadow.\"\nWhile light possessed the power to sever connections, the shining flame took it one step further. The shining flames were capable of erasing all cause and effect of anything it touched.\nWhereas Dark Shadow allowed him to reverse cause and effect, so if the two elements were used against each other, then the winner would be determined by which was more powerful. He’d only just become level 8 and obtained a beginner level 1 innate element, so he couldn’t overcome the Garuda if he went head-to-head with it.\n\"I have the worst luck. I just got an innate element, but why did it have to be an element on par with it?\"\nLee Shin Woo realized how wide the world truly was. After reaching level 8, and obtaining both Dark Shadow and Wild Card, he’d thought that perhaps he was unrivaled. However, he immediately met an enemy that shattered his delusions!\n’Perhaps it was a good thing that he hadn’t been conceited,’ he thought. Jin merely gazed at Lee Shin Woo speechlessly.\n\"Aren’t you the one who’s amazing for obtaining an element on par with that monster’s...? No, wait. How are you even going to fight it anyway?\"\n\"With the dark flames. Dark Shadow won’t work, but the dark flames will. There’s a chance it’ll work since the exhausted Dark Flame Ghosts are putting up a fight.\"\nThe dark flame was a powerful ability that destroyed anything it touched and returned what it destroyed to its wielder. Even if the shining flame erased cause and effect, by stealing that ability, Lee Shin Woo would be able to weaken its efficacy.\n...Of course, the Dark Flame Ghosts were too weak, so they weren’t able to nullify the Garuda’s shining flame, but they were at least weakening it. And through their black armor, Lee Shin Woo was able to gather indirect experience with the dark flames, increasing his proficiency and allowing him to set up countermeasures for the shining flames. As a result...\n[The Intermediate Dark Flame element has become Lv2! Magic has increased by 20.]\n\"Sseup, I’ll have to integrate this element’s power someday.\"\nHe’d already gotten a start. The Wild Card skill fused all of his skills together, so all of his attacks, defenses, or elemental conversions became unconstrained; if he studied exhaustively with this skill, then he should be able to reach the end of his path. Get full chapters from novel⁂fire.net\nThis was ’another step forward’. ’What a difficult next step,’ Lee Shin Woo quietly muttered, and extended one hand forward. At the same time, the Dark Flame Ghosts, which were fighting against the Garuda, stiffened.\n[Gik...!]\n[Kuhik...?]\nOnce he reached level 8, all of his skills (even if they didn’t level up) were affected by his karma and changed in a positive manner. His Rule of Bone was no exception and was strengthened considerably. So much so that he could easily control and restrain the two Dark Flame Ghosts, even though he was tired!\n\"You’ve done well. Now die.\"\n\"You really do talk like a final boss!\"\nIf he let this go on, then the Dark Flame Ghosts would inevitably be killed by the Garuda. That in itself wasn’t a huge problem, but there was a chance that the loot would be burned into dust by the shining flames.\nIf nothing else, he knew the Dark Flame Ghosts had nothing left in them.\n[Guaaaaaah!]\n[Kihiiiiiik!]\nThe Dark Flame Ghost suddenly screamed in agony. Although the Garuda was flustered, it didn’t let go of this chance and unleashed its shining flame onto them.\nBut there was no way that Lee Shin Woo would help him out for nothing. The Dark Flame Ghosts mustered their last remaining strength and barely blocked the shining flames; when their energy was finally depleted and the Garuda was wide open...\n-Kwaaaang!\nLee Shin Woo blew up their black armor. The darkness swelled, covering the Dark Flame Ghosts in their entirety. Then they exploded, unleashing destructive energy onto the Garuda!\n[The Beginner Dark Shadow element has become Lv3. Magic has increased by 20.]\n\"Oh, this Dark Shadow ability’s great.\"\n\"That was Dark Shadow!? Just now!?\"\n\"Yep. Once I acquired the innate element, it became my fundamental element. It’s like my normal attacks are turned into elemental attacks.\"\n\"Sorry. I don’t get it.\"\nThe Dark Shadow element was capable of reversing cause and effect. The explanation was quite ambiguous, but if his image and will were clear, then it was like an omnipotent ability. It was nigh-impossible to do this, aside from Lee Shin Woo himself, so that’s why it was called an innate element.\nLee Shin Woo had used the Dark Shadow element like this just now. Normally, Rule of Bone could only explode bones, but he had reversed cause and effect so that the rest of their body was considered ’bone’. This allowed him to explode their entire body. This was only possible because of his Disguise skill (which he could use on others), as well as his Acting skill, which could even fool the world itself!\n\"That doesn’t make any sense! Now you can fool the world!?\"\n\"It does make sense. You’re looking at it right now. But it’s still imperfect, so don’t go crazy with the compliments.\"\n\"That modesty’s even scarier!\"\n[Guaaaaaaaaaah...!]\nHe’d exploded two level 8 elites, so even the level 9 divine bird (which was in the midst of its undead transformation) couldn’t withstand it unscathed. Lee Shin Woo had landed a direct hit with the explosions, and the Garuda screamed weakly and plummeted. During that time, Lee Shin Woo collected the loot that the Dark Flame Ghosts had left behind.\n\"Jin, if I could, I’d reinforce you, but I have to prioritize the battle for now. Don’t worry, I’ll make sure to make it up to you later.\"\n\"No, you don’t need to worry about that!\"\nLee Shin Woo was deeply moved by Jin’s ’humility’ and soon executed Bone Reinforcement. He reinforced himself with the Dark Flame Ghosts’ bones (he must’ve been lucky, as one of them dropped two bones at once!), while he used the Dark Flame Bone Cores they left behind to reinforce the still-evolving Titan Bone Core.\n[Absorbing the Lv8 Fiery Sand’s Dark Flame Ghost’s wing bone, head exoskeleton, and molar. Fully understanding the Fiery Sand’s Dark Flame Ghosts’ memories. Strength has increased by 80, Agility by 30, Health by 70, and Magic by 65. The Intermediate Dark Flame element has become Lv5 and Magic has increased by 60. The Absorption skill has become LV15 and Magic has increased by 60.]\n\"Mmmmm.\"\nPerhaps it was because he was on equal footing with them now, as the stats he gained were much lower than before. Even if he factored that in, he still gained a huge amount of stats. But more importantly, he had absorbed several bones that originated from the same species, causing them to resonate. This allowed him to see through their entire lifetime!\nHis proficiency in the Dark Flame and the Absorption skills weren’t the only things that grew. By completely analyzing the lives of such high level existences, Lee Shin Woo’s own existence grew. Lee Shin Woo’s state as one who overcame the boundaries of combat skills and elements had grown.\n’But that’s not the issue here. What is...’\nThe memories of them draining the Garuda’s energy for hundreds of years! Those melted into Lee Shin Woo’s body, helping him better understand the Garuda’s abilities, its characteristics, as well as its flaws.\nThey weren’t represented as stats or skills, but these memories gave him the upper hand against the Garuda. Plus...\n[The Titan Bone Core is evolving. You have acquired the Lv8 Dark Flame Bone Core.]\nThe level 8 Titan Bone Core had absorbed four Elite Bone Cores and finished evolving, assuming a different form. The core itself was smaller than before, but the energy within was about two times greater than before! It was such immense energy that Lee Shin Woo wondered why it hadn’t evolved into a level 9 artifact instead.\nThat wasn’t all. Black lines traversed along the outside of the once fully red core like blood vessels. Those lines were the core of its evolution, but it felt a lot gloomier than before, compared to when the lava emitted the feeling of a Giant. But more importantly, the name...!\n\"Dark Flame... Keuk!\"\nHe knew that it meant Dark Flame in English. He knew that, but...! Lee Shin Woo gritted his teeth. Once he’d gotten over the humiliating name, he distanced himself from Jin before the Garuda recovered.\n\"You know you can’t come with me on the golem, right?\"\n\"...If you’re in trouble, I’ll come charging at him to distract him.\"\n\"Thanks, but you won’t need to.\"\nLee Shin Woo grinned. Then, he gripped the core. As the one who’d remodeled the core, he knew best how it had changed, so he didn’t need to check its info.\nOh, right. If he showed the core to Kratia, then she’d be really happy. No, she may look into his new ability first. But in order for that time to come, Lee Shin Woo had to beat this guy.\n\"Synchronize.\"\nThe core absorbed Lee Shin Woo’s overflowing mana, and as it had been remodeled with Lee Shin Woo’s power, it had adopted more of his features; it pulsed darkly and responded.\nThe outside of the core was released and covered his body. The disorderly looking black lines covered the outside of Lee Shin Woo’s body, forming a geometric shape. Eventually, a shape formed onto his body and shined.\n[Synchronization complete. Titan activating.]\nAlthough this was his second time experiencing this, it was really difficult to adjust to the feeling of his small body transforming into a several meter tall Giant. But by reaching level 8, Lee Shin Woo had, in many ways, overcome his physical limitations, allowing him to focus without getting lost.\nHe only realized after the fact, but the Titan was about 10 meters tall. Compared to before, when it was about 7 meters tall, it increased its height by about half. Lee Shin Woo was amazed and clenched both hands tightly. At that moment, a message appeared before him.\n[Activating the Dark Flame Titan. 500 seconds remaining.]\n[Your Strength and Magic temporarily increase by 2,500, and Health and Agility by 2,000.]\nNot only could the Titan be operated for more than double its previous time, but the stat bonuses also didn’t decrease much, despite him leveling up! With the stat bonuses, his total stats were 24,084. In other words, he wasn’t much different from a level 9 being. Plus...\n[While riding the Titan, the Dark Flame skill sublimates. With your current understanding, you can utilize high rank level 5 Dark Flame.]\nA considerable amount of heat radiated from the core and flowed throughout his body, but he welcomed the feeling. The dark flames asserted their existence within the crimson flame!\nAs he had hoped for, the Titan had become a golem specialized in Dark Flame. Although he couldn’t raise his Dark Flame skill over the intermediate level normally, by using the Dark Flame Golem he could.\n\"Shin Woo, it’s coming!\"\n[Kyaaaaaahk!]\nAt that moment, the Garuda struck. It realized that the Dark Flame Titan was no normal foe, and unleashed the largest blast of shining flame it could muster before the Titan could move.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo was already in full control of the Titan. Before he’d gotten on the golem, he had wrapped the Titan in wind mana, and gently raised it up into the sky as if it were floating in response. He extended both his hands and created a wall of dark flame. When the shining flame and his dark flame met, another message appeared before him.\n[You are currently controlling a Titan, and are fighting against a higher level foe, who possesses the power of a god. The Rebellion skill activates. All stats have increased by 56%!]\nThree conditions had been met, so the Rebellion skill gave Lee Shin Woo enough power to fight against a level 9 head on!\n[The Intermediate Dark Flame element has become Lv6. Magic has increased by 20!]\nThe Dark Flame had also intensified and vaporized the shining flame. As he thought, it was still too hard for him to absorb the shining flames, but blocking them was no problem. He had already known about this from the Dark Flame Ghosts, but doing it in person made him shiver.\n[Kyahaaaaah!]\n\"Ha.\"\nCompared to the Dark Flame Ghosts, Lee Shin Woo easily eliminated the condensed shining flame. Seeing that, the Garuda screamed out and charged. Lee Shin Woo summoned the Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatsword to fight it head on. He activated his Gigantification of course, in order to increase its size to 10 meters long.\n[Zenon, let’s go.]\n[I-I understand!]\nZenon meekly obeyed Lee Shin Woo’s orders, settling into the greatsword and reinforcing it. Because of its increased size, Zenon had to expend more energy to reinforce it, but if he couldn’t do that, then he had no right to be an Elder Salamander Prince!\nHe hadn’t done much thus far, so Zenon gritted his teeth and promised that he’d win against the Garuda. It seemed as though his feelings were relayed to Lee Shin Woo, as he smiled more deeply than before.\n[Alright. We’re all ready now! Let’s go!]\n\"You’re too prepared. It feels like you’ll tear the world asunder!\"\n[Gyawooooooo!]\nJin, who’d retreated to a safe distance, retorted, and the Garuda screamed as if belittling him. It fluttered its wings and quickly flew towards Lee Shin Woo. It looked quite majestic; its flames blazed, seemingly twisting the landscape.\n\"It’s only level 9 and it’s contaminated as well, so it must not be an important god.\"\n[It looks plenty important enough to me!]\n\"Yeah. Time for us to kill a god.\"\n[Guaaaaaaaahk!]\nAh, he’d always wanted to say this line.\nWhile wielding the dark flame, Lee Shin Woo hadn’t realized that he’d aroused the hot-bloodedness he’d had as a child. This was the last battle with the dungeon’s boss.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 42 part1",
    "content": "<Chapter 42. Sun God’s Hero - 1>\nThe protagonist awakens in the midst of danger and bravely defeats the final boss; he’s embraced by the princess and then goes home with everyone... That stuff only happened inside comics, Lee Shin Woo realized.\nEven though he’d gained a new ability, there was no guarantee that he could take down the final boss with it. For example, against the Sun God Garuda in front of him!\n[Kureureureureuraaaa!]\n[Huahp!]\nWhenever the black and golden flames clashed, it would let off a deafening roar, as if the sky itself was collapsing. The dungeon had already reached its limit. The explosions caused by the golden flames, which distorted and erased cause and effect, had an indirect effect on the dungeon, causing it to collapse.\n[Guyaaaaaahk!]\n[Keuk...!]\nWhereas Lee Shin Woo was in the heart of these raging flames. Whenever he clashed with the Garuda, he would grit his teeth at the resulting shock.\nIt had been imprisoned for hundreds of years, and had been contaminated by the undead curse. And because of its fight with the Dark Flame Ghosts, its magic had declined; it was in the worst possible situation. Despite that, it wasn’t being pushed back very far in a head-to-head confrontation with Lee Shin Woo.\n[Time remaining: 317 seconds]\nThree minutes had already passed. If he couldn’t beat it by then, then he’d be completely screwed. If it was this tough fighting it while inthe Titan, then how would he fare without it? He wouldn’t get out of this losing just one or two lives.\n’As expected of a level 9 Garuda. It’s strong. Really strong.’\nNow that he thought about it, he felt the exact same way when he’d first met the Archmage. One didn’t level up purely through an accumulation of stats; one needed to achieve enough feats as well.\nHe’d completely changed his way of thinking to reach level 8, but the Garuda had also grown both physically and mentally to reach level 9, so much so that it was difficult for him to comprehend the difficulty. Lee Shin Woo thought he’d be able to defeat such a high level entity by just matching its stats, but he was wrong.\n[Gilululululululu!]\n[Huahp...!]\nLee Shin Woo gritted his teeth, as if to dispel all his hesitation, and thrust his sword. His sword, enveloped in flames, was threatening enough to instill a sense of fear in any strong foe, but the Garuda merely expelled flames from its body and took his greatsword head-on.\nIt was always like this. Lee Shin Woo was used to fighting against stronger foes, and swung his sword so that the Garuda couldn’t dodge. However, the Garuda took his strike head-on, as if never intending to avoid his attack.\nEven if he attacked again, the Garuda wouldn’t be hurt. The shining flames would be diminished for a mere second; they would return to full strength in but a moment.\n’I can’t even inflict a little damage to it like this.’\nDuring their 3 minute long clash, Lee Shin Woo had come to a realization. That it didn’t move its body to fight; it only controlled its shining flames to fight.\nThe shining flames, which enveloped its body, was both a peerless shield and weapon. It would naturally change the shape of its flame to match Lee Shin Woo’s attacks, and it could effortlessly change from offense to defense. Thus, Lee Shin Woo realized that it was far greater at handling its innate element than he was.\n’Most of its stats are probably in magic. It’s completely optimized for fighting with its element alone. But there’s one saving grace: that maintaining its shining flame drains its health and magic simultaneously...’\nAs Zenon had said before, the Garuda had transcended its physical body, and was halfway to becoming a spirit. Therefore, its fighting style resembled that of a spirit using an element, rather than a living being with a physical body. And whether its power came from natural law, magic, a natural element, or an innate element, its shining flames was an almighty ability that erased everything and anything!\nHe could understand why the Magic Emperor had imprisoned it within a barrier rather than fighting it. Rather, Lee Shin Woo thought, ’You’re lucky the barrier lasted so long.’ It was a conceptual barrier that could not be erased by the shining flames, so if he were to fight against the Magic Emperor, then he’d need to prepare some countermeasures. If he could survive, that is.\n[Kureureureureureureuk!]\n[Heup!]\nThe Garuda seized the opportunity, unleashing dozens of shining flame spears, but with one swing of his greatsword, Lee Shin Woo was able to repel them without much difficulty.\nAlthough his sword swing looked simple, it was actually quite complex; he loaded his dark flame into the magic wavelength and moved inscrutably, repelling the shining flame. It was a shocking sight, but Lee Shin Woo, who had managed to do such a feat, just gritted his teeth in fury.\n’We’re still at a stalemate, even after all this...!’\nNow that he could use level 5 High Rank Dark Flame, he remained unscathed, but he had a time constraint. He had 280 seconds left before his time was up; he had to kill the Garuda within that time.\n’There’s a way I can beat it. Though it pisses me off that it’s similar to what the Emperor came up with.’\nIf he could, Lee Shin Woo would’ve wanted to defeat it head-on with his dark flames. Since there was no better opponent than a foe of equal strength to test out and develop his innate element.\nBut that was a miscalculation. He’d promised himself that he wouldn’t get conceited when obtaining great power, but he had been conceited ever since he thought he could beat the level 9 divine bird head-on. He was a level down and had just obtained an innate element. He had just realized this fact.\n[...Fine. I’ll throw away my useless pride, and return to who I used to be: someone who does anything to win.]\n[Can we really call this guy the Sun God’s hero...!?]\nLee Shin Woo hadn’t been wasting time. He had been observing the Garuda’s shining flame ever since it had fought against the Dark Flame Ghosts. And as a result, he concluded that... The way to win was extremely simple, unrefined, and somewhat pissed him off!\n[So what is that simple and unrefined method? I’d appreciate it if you let me in on it, since I’m in the sword you keep smashing into it!]\n[Fine. Let me explain.]\nThe Shining Flame was both a fusion element and an innate element. Thus, the price for using it was high. The more the Garuda (which was specialized in magic) expelled such flames, the more it exhausted its magic. In other words, all he needed to do was make it use up all of its magic. He could easily kill it if he just waited until it wasted all its magic!\nThat’s probably what the Emperor was hoping for when he created this barrier. Although, it had recovered its energy through the undead curse...\n[Everyone knows that! If we (spirits) use up the magic that makes up the source of our existence, then we die too!]\n[That thing’s too strong for me to kill it with any other method!]\nLee Shin Woo couldn’t hold back and yelled. Likewise, Zenon lost his temper. Zenon gritted his teeth and asked.\n[So how exactly are you going to go about this? At this rate, your armor will give out before its magic does!]\n[Hoo. You’re clueless. Everything I’ve done was to gain momentum...]\nIf he continued on like this, he’d never beat it. However, Lee Shin Woo still had a card to play. His innate skill, Wild Card, which he’d gained upon leveling up that combined all of his offensive skills!\n[If you had something like that, you should’ve used it earlier!]\n[Shut up. This skill isn’t easy to use; it won’t unleash its full power just because I want it to. I wanted to beat it with just my innate skills, but I couldn’t activate Wild Card before. I needed time to gather info while I clashed with it.]\nWild Card, as its name might imply, transcended the limitations of active and passive skills. Thus, it was a skill that buffed all of his actions. Strictly speaking, he had constantly been using it up until now.\nWhenever Lee Shin Woo swung his sword in an attempt to harm his foe, his attack would become much faster and more powerful than before. And it was all because of this skill. Lightning Sprint, Lightning Shadow, and Bursting Thunder, all his high rank combat skills dwelled within this skill. Thus, their buffs were included as well. But unlike them, he could use Wild Card with any element.\n’But that’s ultimately just the basic property of this skill. That’s why it doesn’t work unless I’m using my active combat skills, or using an element at the same time.’\nNot only did it fuse several skills in order to explosively increase his offensive and defensive capabilities, but whenever he attacked, he could swiftly switch from a skill to an element. That alone made it an amazing ability, but that wasn’t its true value.\n[Wild Card - Innate Skill Lv1]\n[The most offensive of the Joker’s cards used to engrave their existence onto the world. When you’re in a pinch, all of your abilities are fused together, allowing you to perform an almighty act which can surmount any obstacle, regardless of the circumstances you are in. All of your stats, characteristics, and skills are fused together, and that power is amplified. This skill grows when presented with a clear, indisputable victory.]\nIn a game, a wild card could change into any other card, but the fact that it could change wasn’t very important. What was important was that one could ’win’ as a result of its change.\nTherefore, Wild Card didn’t give him a ’method’ to achieve some result, but would lead him to the result itself. In other words, it would lead him to ’victory’.\n[So, in other words, you win just by using it!? Isn’t that the strongest skill there is!?]\n[You still don’t get it.]\nNothing is free. Every skill had a price, and Wild Card was no exception. In order to be victorious in a game, one must first understand the game.\n[There are four conditions to fully activating Wild Card.]\nUnderstanding his abilities, understanding his enemy’s abilities, understanding the situation he and his enemy are in, and understanding the win condition (the game’s rules).\nMissing any one of these would make the Wild Card a half-assed skill. Like Lee Shin Woo’s battle with the Garuda.\n[Then... Then, can you use the skill to its fullest now?]\n[Yep. Probably.]\nNormally, he would have to use his innate element (which was a match made in heaven with Wild Card), Dark Shadow, to reverse cause and effect a few times to keep things going smoothly. However, his foe had such a specialized power that it had taken this long to set up the game.\nBut if he were to defeat the Garuda and obtain its shining flame as well, things would be different from now on. He would possess three innate elements; he was happy just thinking about it.\n’Now then.’\nHe didn’t need to, but Lee Shin Woo decided to say it out loud to signal the start of his comeback.\n[Wild Card.]\n[Gureuk!]\nLee Shin Woo’s greatsword rushed towards the Garuda a second time. The Garuda snorted, as if saying ’it’ll be the same, no matter how many times you try’ and ignited its shining flame. Follow current novᴇls on NoveI★Fire.net\nAt that moment, Lee Shin Woo’s Combat Sense, Assimilation, Mana Bone, Soul Seeing Eye, Dark Flame, Rule of Bone, Bone Armory, High Rank Regeneration, Mana Acceleration...

These greatswords, armed with Dark Flame, the only power that could erase the shining flame, radiated darkness at their edge and aimed at the Garuda!\nThe Garuda was flustered and widened is eyes, yet it still ignited its shining flame, burning all of the greatswords. But in the blink of an eye, hundreds, no thousands of dark flame swords rushed towards it.\n[I’ve already seen through all your abilities. Erase them all, if you can.]\n[Kikuoooooh!]\nLee Shin Woo was still encased in the golem, with dark flames violently blazing atop it. The Garuda was furious, and expelled shining flames in every direction, as if saying ’I won’t lose’. However, the golem before it remained unscathed.\nNo, it looked a little closer than before.\nThe show had already begun.",

    "content": "<Chapter 42. Sun God’s Hero - 2>\n[Kukaaaah!?] Official source ıs novel_fіre.net\nHow did this human’s power increase so suddenly? Had he been hiding his strength all this time? The Garuda, surrounded by dark flame greatswords, looked around and couldn’t hide its panic.\n[Kikuoooooh!]\n[Next.]\nThough it expelled its flames in every which direction and managed to melt the greatswords, more greatswords would take their place and attack it. Each and every greatsword was tinged in dark flame, so the Garuda could not oppose them without its shining flame!\nAt first, the Garuda thought it may be a hallucination, but there was not a single person in the world that could fool it, the master of the shining flames. Just in case, it allowed one of the greatswords through, but was met with agonizing pain.\nLee Shin Woo’s Dark Flame was much more powerful than the Dark Flame Ghosts’, so the Garuda immediately released its shining flame and erased the greatsword. However, it had taken considerable damage in the process.\n[Guaaaahk! Kugiaaaaah!]\n[Hoo.]\nThere was only one thing it could think of. Either he had way more magic than it did, or he was supplying himself limitless mana through some unknown means!\nBut what about the Garuda? It had just awoken after hundreds of years of imprisonment, so its body was in terrible shape. Its body had been contaminated, its mana hadn’t recovered properly, and it couldn’t use any of its other authorities, aside from its Shining Flame. A few more attacks like this, and it wouldn’t have enough mana to even produce its shining flames!\n[Kureureuk...!]\nThen, what should it do? It obviously had to run away. If it ran away at full speed, a human wouldn’t be able to follow (the Garuda still hadn’t figured out just how fast Jin was). First, it would run away, somehow replenish its mana, figure out the human’s abilities, and then form some countermeasures to them.\nYeah. That would be the rational decision. But because the Garuda’s mind and body had been corrupted by the undead curse, it made the exact opposite call. It unleashed even greater flames, burning away the greatswords, and then charged at the Titan!\n[Kuhaaaaaaaahk!]\n[Nice looking flames you got there!]\nIt was level 9! Although it was standing on the precipice of life and death, there was no way it couldn’t kill a level 8 human! On the contrary, if it were to kill him and then absorb his mysterious mana source, it would soon be restored from this corrupted state!\nIts mind was filled with violence, void of any reason; the Garuda looked like any other undead in the Underground Empire. The Garuda had barely kept itself together before, but had completely snapped after fighting Lee Shin Woo.\n’Good.’\nOn the other hand, Lee Shin Woo couldn’t stop himself from inwardly smiling. After he’d analyzed both his and his enemy’s environment, he had activated Wild Card, which was definitely working.\nOnce he’d activated the skill, he’d anticipated the Garuda’s response, its panicked state, and even its current action... No, by using Wild Card, everything was going according to his ’script’.\n’This skill, Wild Card... Turns a limited space into my stage. It sets up the situation, causing my enemy and the circumstances to go in a certain direction; a direction in which I win. I’m the only main character here...!’\nHonestly, his innate skills (e.g. Disguise, Instigate, Acting, etc.) weren’t suitable for battle. Regardless, Lee Shin Woo had used those skills resourcefully (or forcefully) to overcome danger. However, they weren’t meant to be used to attack the enemy.\nBut when Wild Card fuses all of his skills together and amplifies them, the Joker’s innate skills become the most powerful skills in the world. The clearing, filled to the brim with greatswords, was a good example of this. Those were mostly created with his Disguise and Acting skills... To be frank, they were all falsities that only he and the Garuda could see.\n’If I can make them think it’s real, then it supplants what’s actually ’real’. Moreover, it’s gotten hit by one of my greatswords already, so it’s already afraid.’\nNormally, it would be impossible to use his Disguise, Acting, and Instigate skills on such a large scale. But it was made possible by his Wild Card skill, which made the entire area his own, amplified all of his skills, mixed and matched them, and activated them!\n’You can’t act without the proper stage. Wild Card sets up the perfect stage for me, and when I, the actor, sets foot on that stage, the play begins!’\nOf course, not all of the greatswords within the clearing were fakes. A few of the swords had been created by his Bone Armory skill, so some real weapons were mixed in with the fakes. And when the Garuda had tested to see if it were hallucinating or not, Lee Shin Woo had used a real greatsword. Once it pierced its body, true dark flame erupted from the blade and caused a grievous wound!\n[Kugyaaaaaahk!]\n[You really think you’ll be able to burn all of these with those measly flames? You need more!]\nAs a result, the stage was set. The Garuda thought all of the greatswords were real threats, so it was burning each and every one of them with its flames. While Lee Shin Woo had barely used any mana, the Garuda was releasing its shining flames over a wide area, so its mana was draining fast. Thus, the once close battle had completely turned in his favor.\nIt might be different if the Garuda could reabsorb its mana, but it wasn’t a ’complete’ level 9! Moreover, Lee Shin Woo was dominating the mana in the entire area (as Wild Card had increased his reach), so he was gradually strangling it!\n[Kuguooooooh...!]\nIt hadn’t even been 3 minutes since he’d used the Wild Card skill (he had 140 seconds left before the Titan deactivated), yet the flames that enclosed its body had become pale and diminished significantly. Plus, its form looked clearer than before as well.\nIts half-rotten eyes looked into Lee Shin Woo’s eyes. Its hostility, anger, and regret were reflected within those eyes, as it couldn’t defeat him.\n[Hoo. Hoo. Now you’re starting to look at me.]\n[Kikuoooooh!]\nOriginally, its golden body must’ve been beautiful. However, the many years spent trapped here caused its skin to split, and the undead curse caused his body to rot, blackening its body here and there. That was the biggest cause of its rapidly dwindling intellect.\nIt had been imprisoned by the Magic Emperor’s barrier, and was corrupted by the Undead Emperor’s curse, so the Garuda was just an unfortunate victim of the strife between the two. It was quite pitiful, but directing that anger at Lee Shin Woo would do nothing but inconvenience him.\n[If you even have a shred of reason left, then we shouldn’t have to fight...]\n[You would’ve looked a little cool if you weren’t raising your greatsword.]\nIt seemed as though Zenon had also figured out Lee Shin Woo’s personality by fighting with him, as he retorted like Jin would. But what he didn’t know was that if the Garuda really did have any reason left in it, then Lee Shin Woo would’ve sent it to the surface to wreak havoc onto the Emperor’s forces.\nLee Shin Woo thought about wanting to see the Emperor’s face at least once, and simultaneously thrust with his greatsword forward. His strike was reinforced by Wild Card, allowing it to surpass all limitations. He was able to cut through the weakened shining flame shield like a hot knife through butter and severed one of its wings.\n[Critical Hit!]\n[Dark Flame steals your enemy’s Strength and Magic. While you have the Dark Flame active, Strength is increased by 150 and Magic by 350.]\n[You have acquired the fusion element, Beginner Shining Flame Lv1. Magic has increased by 20.]\nHe had completely severed one of its wings. The severed wing fell from the sky, the dark flames engulfing and vaporizing it on the way down. Then, he felt the Garuda’s strength wane while the Titan’s magic increased! At long last, his Dark Flame had absorbed the Shining Flame and destroyed it, resulting in him acquiring the Shining Flame!\n[Kuguooooooooooh!]\nThe Garuda, losing one of its wings, let out an agonizing cry that threatened to blow up the dungeon. No, it actually happened.\nA high level monster and a Titan had clashed, so the dungeon had begin to collapse on the inside. But its cry was the straw that broke the camel’s back. The ceiling and the walls began to break!\n\"The dungeon’s collapsing!\"\n\"No, more importantly, look over there! That giant bird and that giant...!\"\n\"A greatsword! The size is different, but that’s the greatsword that Sir Kay wields...!\"\n\"Does that mean that that giant is Kay!?\"\n\"A-Are the other members of the 12 generals almost here!? No, even if one or two of the 12 generals do come, we still wouldn’t be able to beat that...\"\nMoonlight fell upon the clashing Garuda and Titan, and the surrounding humans just watched in shock! They now had an audience.\nEveryone watched the several meter tall firebird, and the dark flame giant fighting against it. It was like a reenactment of myth, and no one could do anything as they all just remained rooted in place in awe of what was happening in front of them.\n’This is dangerous.’\nLee Shin Woo had prepared his Wild Card in case it tried to escape, but felt a little nervous that it might go to waste. However, that didn’t end up happening.\nOn the contrary, its contamination spread even further with the loss of its wing, so a somber darkness came out of its body, simultaneously strengthening its magic and taking away all its intellect. As a result, the darkness and the shining flames mixed together, and the Garuda charged Lee Shin Woo once more!\n[Kyahaaaaaaahk!]\n[Darkness? Ha, that’s good news for me.]\nIf it had stuck to its shining flames, then it would’ve lasted longer. But to think it would use darkness against him, when it couldn’t even properly control it yet!\nIn the process of reaching level 8, Lee Shin Woo had completely mastered the Darkness element. Yet, the Garuda was trying to harm him, not with a fusion element, but with the darkness element that naturally clad its body once it became an undead? That’s funny. He snorted and took it head-on.\n[Die!] [1]\n[Kugooooooooh!]\nHe raised his greatsword up high and swung downwards like lightning. As if copying the Garuda, Lee Shin Woo’s blade was clad in both dark and golden flames (half and half), but the power contained within was incomparably greater than the Garuda’s flames.\n\"The power that’s enveloping the golem’s sword...\"\n\"It’s mixing light and darkness together. It looks to be the stronger of the two...!\"\nThe humans looked up at Lee Shin Woo’s sword and yelled in shock. However, Lee Shin Woo merely used Dark Shadow to mix Dark Flame and Shining Flame together. Now that the Garuda’s shining flames had weakened was the perfect time for him to use Dark Shadow!\n[Guaaaaaaaaaaah!]\n[Huahp!]\nWhen Lee Shin Woo’s greatsword and its beak clashed, the Garuda’s darkness energy flowed backwards and exploded. The explosion was both gruesome and beautiful, and the ground cried out once more.\nThe Garuda’s beak was broken into pieces, and its shining flames had dispersed. Lines of flames appeared from its head to its tail. Although it was corrupted, it was still a divine bird. It wouldn’t forgive the greatsword for daring to touch its body and used its last remaining energy to burn it in an instant. However, it couldn’t undo Lee Shin Woo’s strike, so it was cut in half.\nBut it wasn’t over just yet.\n[Young spirit.]\n[H-Huh!?]\nZenon was simply dwelling with Lee Shin Woo’s greatsword. He had been relaxing within it and watched the battle between the Garuda and Lee Shin Woo as if he were watching a movie. But then, he suddenly heard someone initiate a conversation with him.\n[I am the Child of the Sun, the Father of the Flame. Garuda. I have a request for you, as one who has lived the same life as myself...]\nTo think, it was the Garuda, who Lee Shin Woo had just cut in half and killed!\nThat’s right. Once the boss battle was over, the ’conversation with a soul’ event had started. Without Lee Shin Woo at that...!\n[1] T/N: This actually says \"Be cut in half and die\".",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 42 part3",
    "content": "<Chapter 42. Sun God’s Hero - 3>\n’It’s not over.’\nLee Shin Woo narrowed his eyes. Although the Garuda’s corpse had disappeared, it hadn’t dropped any loot yet. He had a hunch as to why. Since a snow-white light rose from within the Garuda’s body as it disappeared and was sticking to the Titan’s body.\nWhen the greatsword melted away, Zenon immediately left the blade and entered the Titan. This peculiar phenomenon probably had something to do with Zenon... His assumption was completely correct. Zenon was busy speaking with the Garuda’s final remaining will.\n[Young spirit. Could you inherit my will?]\n[L-Lord Garuda. I’m just a regular spirit following this human...]\nZenon was conversing with a part of the Garuda’s consciousness. When it had realized that its body and soul were being eroded by the undead curse, the Garuda had torn a piece of its soul off and stored it away; its soul was incredibly pure.\nOf course, not everyone could do this just because they were a high level. It was only possible for the Garuda because it had developed its innate element, the Shining Flame, and the light element to near perfection.\n[The fact that I was able to meet you, one who wields the same fire energy as me, before I died in vain must be due to God. And if you’ve chosen that human as your contractor, then I will respect your decision.]\n[Is that so...]\nThe Garuda spoke amicably, but it just made Zenon feel a sense of awe and break into a cold sweat.\nIt probably didn’t understand Zenon and Lee Shin Woo’s relationship in the least. If that’s not it, then it wouldn’t be so calm! Zenon thought about it faintly, but he didn’t say it out loud.\n[If you have something you want from me, then... Please say so.]\nHis short interaction with Lee Shin Woo was drawing attention to him. Right now, the right move was to just listen to what the Garuda had to say!\n[This human, who you’ve entrusted your soul to, is incredibly strong. Moreover, he’s realized part of the truth of this world at such a young age, so if he doesn’t tread down the wrong path, then he should be able to correct the chaos of this world.]\n[Chaos...]\n[You should already know. That curse, which was able to corrupt even I, who had transcended death, came about due to mankind’s unending greed... If left unchecked, the world is doomed. So long as your contractor... a hero doesn’t correct it.]\nThat’s right. The Garuda possessed some divinity, albeit weak, so it knew that Lee Shin Woo was one of God’s heroes! Hearing that, Zenon slightly tilted his head.\n[Then why aren’t you telling him this yourself?]\n[It’s related to what I’m about to tell you. I will give you the power to erase anything, so... if that hero treads the wrong path, then I’d like you to destroy him with your own two hands.]\nZenon could tell how earnest the Garuda was being and just laughed inside. He doesn’t think that that’s actually possible, does he? However, the Garuda maintained its serious tone and continued. Thıs text ıs hosted at novel⸺fire.net\n[Your contractor’s ability is exceptional. At such a young age, he not only reached level 8 but also possesses the ability to distort the truth. In my long life, I’ve never seen someone like him. He should be able to correct the chaos that plagues the surface and the underground. However, if he were to go astray, then it will result in unspeakable disaster...]\n[Yes, that’s true.]\nNow that Lee Shin Woo was level 8, he considered life and death the same. And with his Wild Card skill, he could distort reality in a limited space. The Garuda probably didn’t know this, but Lee Shin Woo’s innate element, Dark Shadow, was incredibly dangerous (The Garuda thought that Lee Shin Woo’s innate element was something like the Fiery Sand’s Dark Flame Ghosts’ Dark Flame).\nAnd if he were to advance even further? What if he were to use that power for evil? The world would become even worse than it is now. He was right of course. He’s right, but...\n’But I don’t think this human will do something so troublesome. Moreover, contrary to the Garuda, he hasn’t been affected by the curse, and can actually use the curse for himself...’\nZenon couldn’t imagine Lee Shin Woo straying from his path. If he had to be wary of anyone who had a dangerous ability and was talented, then there were so many more that he’d have to be worried about. After all, even the Garuda, who had obtained divinity, had caused a lot of trouble!\nYet, he had the gall to say something like ’exterminate the hero’, so Zenon was speechless. Regardless of the why, Zenon thought it just wanted vengeance against the one who’d killed it...\n’What would Lee Shin Woo... The contractor of the Spirits’ Spring, say at a time like this...’\nLee Shin Woo would keep his mouth shut and get what he could first. If he retorted, then the Garuda might leave, which would be such a waste! Zenon nodded his head and the Garuda continued in satisfaction.\n[Of course, you do not possess the power to oppose your contractor. So I’ll give you what you need. I will instill my power into this golem that you currently reside in, so if the time comes when you must put him down, you just need to come into this golem. It will cause the giant to ignite the accumulating shining flames inside itself, and even your contractor won’t be able to avoid death.]\n[...I understand.]\n[And I’ll give you my power as well. You will become my successor who wields both light and flame, so if you continue to train both, then you will one day be able to use my innate element... Shining Flame! I grant you this authority for the sake of all spirits, so if you’re in a situation where your own power is insufficient, then you should borrow their power to overcome it!]\nSo the Garuda did have an underlying motive for bestowing his power. He was giving him one of the Garuda’s abilities, the power of light which could sever all! It thought that if he was given this power, which could sever all connections if need be, then he wouldn’t be controlled by Lee Shin Woo.\n[Then, young spirit. I hope you make the right decision. I hope that you use this power that I leave behind for the betterment of this world...!]\nThe Garuda’s remaining consciousness emitted a bright light and split into two. One went into Zenon, and the other was absorbed by the Titan. It forcefully raised Zenon’s ’level’ and raised his body and soul to new heights. To be more specific, Zenon’s karma exploded and he leveled up!\n[Lv8 Shining Salamander Zenon]\nThat wasn’t all. Zenon realized that he could now use the high rank level 1 light element. To think he, who was born a fire spirit, would be able to use another element as well! The Garuda wasn’t wrong when it said that he would be its successor!\nBut what he gained wasn’t purely positive either. The Garuda’s will, which possessed divinity, had a huge effect on Zenon and planted a sense of distrust in Lee Shin Woo. But it was the exact opposite of Zenon’s original feelings, so he felt quite uncomfortable.\n[Is this the price of thoughtlessly accepting a god’s power?]\n[Yeah. That’s not something you accept without thinking.]\nHe had forged an improper contract with God and become a magical girl... No wait, he was forced into becoming a hero. Lee Shin Woo genuinely gave him some advice and Zenon found himself nodding automatically... But then asked in shock.\n[Did you hear everything!?]\n[Not everything, but most of it. If it knew that I was the one who made the Titan and it was made of bone, then it wouldn’t have done something as stupid as talking within it. Even at the very end, that asshole looked down on me.]\n[...I think he did. He thought he’d lost to you because of his corruption.]\nOf course, it was true that the Garuda had weakened, so much so that it was incomparable to its original strength, but had made a basic miscalculation.\nIt hadn’t realized that Lee Shin Woo had used his ability to ’create a stage in which he could win against the Garuda’! In other words, Lee Shin Woo was way too talented!\n[I’ll take care of it, so stay still.]\n[Mm, Mmmm...!]\nLee Shin Woo looked squarely at Zenon with his Soul Seeing Eye. Immediately after, he used his Dark Flame and Shining Flame to cut out a piece of Zenon’s body. Then, the unpleasant feeling disappeared. He was a little weaker, but it wasn’t enough to lower his level.\nLee Shin Woo erased the Garuda’s foolish will with his shining flames and absorbed only the essence within.\n[The Beginner Shining Flame skill has become Lv3. Magic has increased by 20.]\nWith this, the negative effects of the Garuda’s power disappeared from Zenon. He was going to erase the traces of the Garuda’s will from the golem as well but decided to leave it be, as he found that he could use it for himself.\nBut Lee Shin Woo found his experiences and abilities a bit lacking to properly study it. Moreover, he couldn’t maintain the Titan Bone Golem any longer.\n[Beginning to recharge heat. Time before fully charged: 45 days]\n’It’s gotten a lot stronger, and the recharge time went down too. It’s more efficient at absorbing heat now, which may be attributed to the reinforced Dark Flame’s power of absorption. ...The next time I call the Titan, I hope I can combine all the flames together.’\nLee Shin Woo gripped the Titan Bone Core, which released the Titan form and returned to its original size, and then sighed.\nThe Garuda had engraved the Shining Flame deep within the golem. If he got more used to the Shining Flame and advanced enough that he was able to combine the Shining Flame and the Dark Flame together, then he should be able to develop the golem even further. To be more specific, he would be able to raise the Titan to level 9.\n[After unearthing the dungeon’s secrets, you managed to defeat the dungeon’s master, who had managed to acquire divinity. You have acquired the title, ’He Who Challenges God’. All stats are increased by 10% when battling against the divine. All stats have increased by 50. The Rebellion skill has become Lv6 and all stats have increased by 10.]\nBy the time Lee Shin Woo had eliminated all traces of the Garuda, a message indicating that the battle was over finally appeared! He had just acquired an innate element, yet there was another headache inducing word (god) that he’d have to look into... But more importantly, he had to collect all the loot!\n[Lucky Strike! You have acquired 681,993,040 Perium! The Lucky Strike skill has become Lv5!]\n[You have acquired the Lv9 Garuda’s Wing Bone and Sphenoid Bone!]\n[You have acquired the Lv9 Phoenix’s Feather. The Bone Reinforcement skill is not at a high enough level, so a change does not occur.]\n[You have acquired the Lv8 God Sword of Light. Through the Bone Reinforcement skill, it changes into the Lv8 Death God’s Shining Bone Sword (+3).]\n[You have acquired a Lv7 Sunstone. Through the Bone Reinforcement skill, it changes into the Lv8 Sun Fossil.]\nNo way. To think Lucky Strike would activate here. He gaped from gaining 700 million Perium all at once.\nThat wasn’t all. Befitting a divine bird trapped underground for hundreds of years, it dropped such amazing loot! But Lee Shin Woo couldn’t keep his eyes off of one of the two bones... the Garuda’s Wing Bone.\n\"Shin Woo, are you ok... H-Huh!?\"\nOnce he’d confirmed that the battle was over, Jin had flown over to Lee Shin Woo, but for some reason, he felt a chill and started shaking. As if he felt the pain that was to come!",

    "content": "<Chapter 42. Sun God’s Hero - 4>\nThe Pope and the Evileye General had requested reinforcements from the other religious orders and the palace at the same time. However, the Evileye General delayed her reinforcements as long as possible; the Pope saw through her scheme and had asked the other religious orders for assistance in saving the hero Kay. Which turned out quite well for him.\n\"In the name of the Great God, we accept your call for help. It would be a waste to let the hero Kay die in a place like this. The Great God has also taken an interest in that man.\"\n\"You came, Bykel!\"\nIt hadn’t been long, yet the reinforcements from the Great God, Merciful God, and God of Life religions had come. They had probably come after weighing their own interests, but it meant they, like the Sun God religion, understood the severity of the situation!\nAs proof of this, the Great God religion had sent their top level 6 Archbishop, Bykel Von Guraolit, while the Merciful God religion had sent their level 7 Paladin Leader, Maria Eldaletz, widely considered the Merciful God religion’s deterrent against the 12 Generals. The God of Life religion had outright sent their entire Paladin order, which consisted of level 6s who specialized in defense.\n\"A level 8 dungeon... Now I’ve seen everything. But I won’t back down. Since the Merciful God will watch over all, even if they worship another God...!\"\n\"The God of Life is the same. His grace extends to all creation, and all living beings have the right to struggle until the end comes.\"\n\"Keuk.\"\nThe Evileye General, Shurina Von Hegel, gritted her teeth as she saw the three religious orders ready to enter the dungeon without hesitation, despite it being a level 8 dungeon.\nIf the level 7 Pope of the Sun God religion, as well as the Paladin Leader of the God of Mercy religion, worked together, then they might be able to save Kay from the level 8 dungeon! And if that happened, then the odds would be against the Emperor’s side, or more specifically her, who was responsible for this area...\n\"Recklessly entering the dungeon is dangerous. As one of the 12 Generals who protect all the citizens of the Empire, I cannot let you enter the dungeon without His Majesty’s explicit instruction, so long as it has become a level 8 dungeon!\"\n\"Sorry, but our hero is still fighting even now. We’re just going to go in, save him, and come right out.\"\n\"You’ll provoke the monsters inside more than is necessary if you go inside. You must go inside only after we’ve established a line of defense!\"\nThose who heard her shook their heads. Her ability to escape reality was on the level of an innate skill.\n\"You’re still uttering such nonsense. A line of defense? What do you think a line of defense will do against a level 8 dungeon!?\"\n\"What you’re trying to do is so obvious that it’s distasteful, Evileye General. If that’s the case, then why hasn’t the palace sent any reinforcements when it’s so close to the capital? It makes no sense that our reinforcements arrived before yours when our religious orders are so far apart from each other.\"\nThe Merciful God religion’s Paladin Leader, Maria Eldaletz said harshly. Although the other religious orders weren’t pleased with Kay’s increasing fame, they decided to overlook it and agreed to work together in order to cut down the Emperor’s authority.\nMoreover, there were rumors that Kay had become level 8, so someone as powerful as him may eventually be able to oppose the Emperor head-on. They couldn’t lose someone so valuable here. No matter what!\n- Kwang!\nAt that moment, the dungeon exploded. Those arguing were shocked and looked back. The dungeon began to collapse and the hot flames melted the ceiling, exposing the dungeon’s interior.\nA giant firebird and giant were clashing against each other.\n\"T-That’s...?\"\n\"The dungeon’s collapsed!\"\n\"More importantly, those are...!? That giant bird and giant... what exactly are they...!?\"\nAs they weren’t within range of his Wild Card skill, they didn’t see the countless greatswords; they merely saw the two of them confronting each other and igniting their flames. But that was plenty.\n\"T-The flames...\"\n\"They’ve been sublimated. To the realm of the gods!\"\nThe sight of the Dark Flame and Shining Flame clashing, exploding, and then vaporizing each other several times was overwhelming, regardless of whether they were fighting or not. The other religions, as well as the Evileye General’s troops reacted similarly, but the members of the Sun God religion...!\nThey, who could wield fire, albeit weakly, instinctively knew what the firebird and giant were, which shocked them.\n\"A greatsword! The size is different, but that’s definitely what Sir Kay wielded...!\"\n\"Then is that giant Sir Kay!?\"\n\"Impossible. His flames have sublimated into something greater than mere flame. That’s... the power of a god. Two gods are fighting against one another!\"\n\"Is that really... Kay...?\"\nHe knew that Kay was strong. He also knew that Kay was hiding something. However, he’d never thought that Kay was ’actually involved with the Sun God’. The Pope just thought that Kay had some ulterior motive and was a clever individual that fit well with them. However...\n\"It’s blinding. A truly blinding power... What else could you call that other than the sun?\"\nThe Pope let his thoughts be known. Of course, Lee Shin Woo’s Titan used Dark Flame as its main element, but he’d added the Shining Flame that he’d just acquired to his greatsword. And with his Dark Shadow, he had reversed the Dark Flame, coating both his greatsword and body in golden flames.\nWhereas the Garuda had, at first, expelled Shining Flame, but was now gradually being enveloped in darkness. It looked like it was currently encased in blackened flames. Their roles had completely flipped.\n\"Aaah.\"\n\"Sir Kay... He really was sent by God.\"\n\"How...?\"\nEven those from the other religions were speechless at the overwhelming sight. The Merciful God religion’s Paladin Leader, Maria Eldaletz focused on Lee Shin Woo’s transcendent element. As she was strong herself, she, more than the others, knew just how impossibly strong Lee Shin Woo currently was.\nAnd the Evileye General, Shurina Von Hegel was no exception. But the way she reacted was different from the others.\n\"A-Are the other 12 Generals not here yet!? No, one or two of them won’t be enough to deal with that...\"\n\"There’s no need to call reinforcements anymore, Evileye General.\"\nAt some point, the Sun God religion’s Pope had approached the panicking Evileye General. He was briefly captivated by the Titan, which exhibited greatness almost in line with the Sun God himself, but he got a hold of himself and looked more energetic than before.\nHe was confident as he smiled at the Evileye General. It was the face of someone sure that God was by his side.\n\"Since it looks like Kay can deal with it himself.\"\n\"How foolish. That giant cannot be controlled by man! How can you be so sure that that giant won’t attack us!?\"\n\"Haha. I suppose you can’t see it. But we’ve spent so much time with Kay that we see it clearly. Very clearly.\"\n\"That’s impossible...\"\nThat’s right. Although he’d changed into an enormous Titan, his moves were synonymous with Kay’s, who they’d spent more than a month with.\nIt couldn’t be controlled by man? No, if that were true, then they wouldn’t need to be afraid. Since it would just be another powerful monster rampaging about. The reason they were in awe of Kay’s new form was because he had full control of that tremendous power and was sublimating it with his own abilities. Kay had become the true master of that power.\n\"Oh Sun God, please grant your blessing to your loving children. And I thank you for your never-ending grace of sending him to us...\"\nAfter he’d shut up the Evileye General, the Pope quietly prayed to the Sun God in thanks. No believer of the Sun God could bear witness to the sight and stay still!\nThe Sun God’s child was using His flames to exterminate the wicked flames that surged from beneath the ground, so they couldn’t be a believer if they couldn’t recognize their god’s flames.\n\"Oh. Ooooh.\"\n\"Sir Kay is swinging his flaming greatsword... He’s clashing with the firebird!\"\n\"R-Run away! The heat’s spreading!\"\n\"Uaaaaaahk!\"\nThe heat from the battle intensified. When the Garuda and Titan landed their final blows, the shock created a wavelength of mana that surpassed mere heat and spread throughout the entire area. However, they were completely oblivious to the fact.\n\"But this heat is...\"\n\"Uoh... Ooooh!?\"\nThe others, aside from the Sun God religion, were shocked and avoided it, but the Sun God’s devotees didn’t move, as if they had been given a revelation from the Sun God himself.\nThey couldn’t oppose such heat... However, when they were struck by the heat, they started glowing with hot mana. The heat hadn’t harmed them. Rather, it had stimulated their own mana and strengthened it!\n\"Fire is burning bright within my body.\"\n\"The Sun God is blessing us right now!\"\n\"No, this is Sir Kay’s blessing...!\" Read complete versıon only at N()velFire.net\nSurprisingly, there were level 6 paladins and priests that grew to level 7 as a result. Three of them had leveled up at that! Those who hadn’t found that their fire element and resistance had increased, and there were those who gained stats, a new title, and even a new skill!\n\"The Sun God.\"\n\"That man is undoubtedly the Sun God.\"\n\"Hoo...\"\nThe Pope was no exception. While he hadn’t leveled up, he had been stuck as a high rank level 7 for the longest time.\nBut the heat had caused several skills to level up, and with his newly acquired title, his stats had increased significantly. He was shocked. He had long thought his advancement was hopeless, but now the path was wide open for him!\n\"Hoo. I’m glad no one has died.\"\nWhile the members of the Sun God religion took control of their newfound power, the others were speechless at their sudden increase in strength, which had more than doubled collectively. Then, Lee Shin Woo came out from the explosion. Of course, this was after the Titan was released.\n\"Hello. I told you I’d leave after I cleared the dungeon, but you called reinforcements anyway. You didn’t need to.\"\n\"Haha. Hahahaha. You’re right. You always say that, so I had no way of knowing whether you were telling the truth or not. So I ended up doing something I shouldn’t have.\"\nThe Pope couldn’t help but laugh at the sight of Lee Shin Woo greeting him from atop a winged horse.\nThe emergence of a level 8 dungeon, the advent of an absolute boss monster that couldn’t be overcome, the giant that fought against it, and the flame of flames!\nThe Sun God’s believers had also awakened from just watching the mythical battle. Those were all unbelievable events, yet Lee Shin Woo, the source of all this, looked exactly the same as before.\n\"I’ve never lied to you before. I’m a bit sad that you thought that way.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s statement only caused the Pope’s smile to widen further. He wanted to bow down before Lee Shin Woo but barely stopped himself. As he requested, the Pope decided to remain as a trader, an equal, and replied.\n\"Don’t worry. I’ll believe everything you say from now on. There’s no one I trust more.\"\n\"Hoo. Good, that’s plenty. And having an audience was kind of nice.\"\nWas the Pope satisfied? Lee Shin Woo grinned. Then, he nonchalantly dropped a bombshell that would surprise all the surface dwellers.\n\"I’ve taken care of the tail end of the darkness that comes from the underground. You need an audience for a moment of history like this.\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 42. Sun God’s Hero - 5>\nLee Shin Woo wanted to put everything aside and just collect the loot but now wasn’t the time. By killing the Garuda, which plugged up the hole, Lee Shin Woo had allowed the underground curse to leak from the partially destroyed dungeon.\nFirst, Lee Shin Woo placed all the Perium, the wing bone, the sphenoid bone, the Phoenix’s Feather, the Death God’s Shining Bone Sword, and the Sun Fossil into his inventory. After that, he called the Pope’s party over. The Evileye General eyed Lee Shin Woo as if she were going to kill him, but everyone else looked at him with admiration.\n\"Sir Kay... You truly are amazing.\"\n\"I could feel the power of a god. The Sun God must’ve chosen you to represent Him.\"\n\"I would like to duel you someday.\"\nHe could understand why the believers in the Sun God were acting so ardently towards him, but he was taken aback by the reactions of the other three religions.\nThey worshipped different gods, so he thought they’d ostracize him, but the power he’d displayed had broken down all barriers among the religions and they looked at him with pure reverence.\n\"Sir Kay, I admire your faith. Although the God you believe in is different from my own, that determination of yours is something to admire. I’d really like to learn that sword aura you used at the end.\"\n\"Oh, mm... I’ll teach you if I have the time.\"\nMaria Eldaletz, the beauty whose blonde hair was tied up, looked at him with a bright expression, which was especially burdensome to him. Seeing that, Jin began to feel worse and worse.\n’You’re so popular. You must be loving it.’\n’You’re popular too.’\n’This isn’t being popular. I’ve become a clown! Even though you’re the Joker!’\nThat’s right. Before, Jin had been considered just a strong horse that Kay rode on, but now that he had steel wings and could fly, the paladins were curious and were checking him out. After all, it was any knight’s dream to fly in the sky atop a winged horse!\n\"So it wasn’t just fast.\"\n\"Is this horse a divine creature sent by the Sun God...?\"\n\"A divine creature... It probably is. I thought it was quite the beautiful horse before.\"\n\"Ahem!\"\nJin saw Maria Eldaletz flirt with Lee Shin Woo and felt unpleasant, so he kicked the approaching paladins with his hind legs. The paladins misunderstood his actions and thought ’it truly is a divine creature that chooses its owner’.\n\"The undead curse, huh. Do you think we can just leave it like this?\"\nWhereas, the Pope remained the most calm out of everyone there. He and the Evileye General knew how serious the situation was. He also knew why Lee Shin Woo had prioritized exploring the bottom of the dungeon first.\n\"Yes. I should be able to do something about it with the power I just acquired.\"\n\"It’s not power you already possessed?\"\n\"I’m telling the truth. Seriously.\"\n\"Haha.\"\nWhile teasing Lee Shin Woo, the Pope exchanged glances with the Great God’s Archbishop, Bykel. Right now, they were keeping the Evileye General in check.\nIf word got out that the undead curse had appeared at the bottom of the dungeon, a dungeon which was close to the capital and was managed by one of the 12 Generals, then the Emperor’s image would worsen. They didn’t know what the Evileye General would do, so they were keeping tabs on her. Lee Shin Woo soon saw what they were doing and understood why they were doing it.\n\"There’s nothing to worry about. That woman won’t be able to do a thing.\"\n\"If you say so.\"\n\"Yes. So long as another one of the 12 Generals doesn’t try and kill us.\"\n\"...!?\"\nIt wasn’t the Pope that was startled, but the Evileye General herself. Lee Shin Woo grinned at her. There was a sharp edge underneath that congenial smile.\n\"The Evileye, was it? They’re quite beautiful.\"\n\"I-Is that so?\"\n\"Now, get a move on while being mindful of others. So that those beautiful eyes don’t get hurt.\"\n\"...Ok.\"\nThe Evileye General shook. Those who saw her awkward movements instantly understood what was going on. She was hiding something, and that secret of hers involved being one of the 12 Generals in some capacity. And Lee Shin Woo had seen through it all...\n’Is it a skill that lets her establish a target? It’s quite unique, but it’s easy to understand.’\nAt first, Lee Shin Woo hadn’t realized this, but he could tell with ease now that he was level 8. The Evileye General’s ability was a support focused ability, rather than an offensive ability.\nIt was an ability that allowed her to ’target’ someone. She could share this ability with her allies, and it increased the likelihood of hitting the target and/or landing a fatal strike. It was a good ability for her own use, but its true value lay in its ability to be shared with allies!\nAnd Lee Shin Woo felt the presence of a powerful foe waiting from afar. They were probably sharing the Evileye General’s targeting ability and specialized in long range attacks.\n’It’s a nice ability, but... Killing her and taking that ability is pointless since it’s a rank lower than my Wild Card skill, which allows me to control the situation in its entirety.’\nMoreover, although its use was unquestionably simple, countering it was also incredibly easy. It would be easy for him to erase the targeting with his Shining Flame, or he could reverse the attack with Dark Shadow. No, he even knew how much damage they would inflict if he decided to tank the hit.\nBut this was limited to Lee Shin Woo alone. He wasn’t sure he’d be able to protect everyone else. If that’s the case, then he had no choice but to kill that general (the one lying in wait). But because that meant that he’d have to fight against the Emperor, he wasn’t too happy about the situation.\nThat’s why he’d warned the Evileye General. He basically said, ’If you don’t want to die, then be good and follow me’.\n\"As I thought, the Evileye General is...\"\n\"Protect Sir Kay. He is currently carrying out God’s will.\"\nAlthough she was a member of the loyal 12 Generals, she had no reason to risk her life. She bit her lower lip and followed the group from the rear. This meant that she wouldn’t try anything.\nSeeing that, Lee Shin Woo smiled thinly and led the group into the dungeon. Due to the clash between the Titan and the Garuda, they were pretty much descending a rock face, but most of the people here were stronger than level 6. No matter how steep the slope, they could follow him with ease.\n\"By the way, if you find any loot, please pick it up for me.\"\n\"Understood!\"\n\"How can this be? Aren’t these the bones of level 8 monsters...? To think that there are so many of their bones laying around.\"\n\"But why are there only bones as loot?\"\nEven if they were the ones that killed the monsters, Lee Shin Woo had claimed ownership over the loot. His karma would change the monster’s loot to bone, but bones already had a high drop rate, so they weren’t really suspicious. Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn novelFɪre.net\nWith the paladins’ help and his discreet use of Rule of Bone, he was able to collect the bones that had been left behind.\n’Nice. Level 8 dungeons are on another level. It’ll be close, but if I give him the Garuda’s Wing Bone, then Jin should reach level 8 as well.’\n’...Wait a sec. The Garuda’s Wing Bone? You’re going to give that thing to me? Hey, don’t! What the hell are you thinking!?’\nLee Shin Woo had been so focused on his fights with the Dark Flame Ghosts and the Garuda that he hadn’t noticed, but during those bloody battles, the level 8 Solar Scarabs had been climbing up from the bottom of the dungeon and died in droves.\nHe didn’t think that there would be that many of them, but... He didn’t know why insect-type monsters were so fearsome. Though they couldn’t be compared to cockroaches, in which finding one meant that there were a hundred more of them, but the Solar Scarabs had been breeding for hundreds of years at the bottom of the dungeon. Thus, there was a surprising amount of Solar Scarabs that had been in the dungeon...!\n\"What if we had to kill all of these ourselves?\"\n\"In a sense, it might’ve been a tougher battle than the one we had with the divine bird.\"\nOnce they arrived at the bottom of the dungeon and followed the path, they occasionally found some shaking Solar Scarabs that weren’t dead. Since there was really no point in killing them, Lee Shin Woo allowed Jin or the members of the Sun God religion to kill them for karma.\nThey were just finishing them off, so they wouldn’t get much karma from it. Even so, they were still killing level 8 monsters, so either their stats or their skills would grow.\n\"There’s nothing we can use these bones for, but they dropped quite a bit of Perium. So much that you could buy a city with it.\"\n\"Haha. I suppose the Lawrence shop won’t need our support anymore.\"\n\"By the way, why did you accept Lawrence’s help? With your power, you should’ve been able to attain whatever you wish, regardless of his monetary support.\"\n\"It’s the opposite. I’m helping Lawrence out. Since he’s my friend.\"\n\"...Ahem.\"\n\"A friend, huh.\"\nLee Shin Woo replied, but for some reason, some of the female paladins and priests turned their heads away and blushed. From their reactions, Lee Shin Woo could tell what the ’friendship novel’ that was being sold in the capital was all about and felt strange. A gay romance between himself and himself? That’s impossible!\n\"We’ve arrived.\"\n\"This place is... Ahem.\"\nHow much longer did they go on like that? Soon, the group arrived at the hole that the Garuda had escaped from. The barrier had been broken into pieces, and they could see the black energy leaking from within. The expressions of any priest that neared the energy darkened immediately, but when Lee Shin Woo extended his hand, they were ok again.\n\"W-What did you just do...!?\"\n\"I burned it away with a clean flame. But be careful. If you approach it without me, then you’ll become undead soon.\"\n\"Undead!?\"\n\"That firebird was undead as well. Because of this energy.\"\n\"Even that bird, which possessed a god’s power, was affected by this energy...?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nLee Shin Woo pondered briefly. Should we talk about the barrier that had originally imprisoned the Garuda? No, that would be a huge mistake. He shouldn’t reveal any more information than is strictly necessary.\nWhen the Emperor gets word of his actions here, he’ll become wary of him anyway, so there was no reason to reveal more information and make him an even larger threat!\n\"I don’t know why the firebird was here for so long. But I do know that if it hadn’t been weakened and degenerated by this energy, then I wouldn’t have been able to beat it.\"\n\"An energy that leaks from underground... We’ve experienced this in a few of the other dungeons. We can’t hold onto the notion that they’re turning into the undead naturally anymore. This is critical.\"\n\"The God of Life will not tolerate this foul energy. If you’ve found this kind of energy elsewhere, then I cannot overlook this. We’ll have to mobilize all of our members and respond!\"\nThey adopted grave expressions and chattered about just by watching the darkness energy leaking out. Even the Evileye General was in a cold sweat.\n\"Why did the Emperor turn a blind eye to this until it’d become this bad?\"\n\"The golem network that the Empire is so proud of couldn’t even pick up such clear signs that this was happening?\"\n\"...I trust that you’re not going to say that the Emperor left it here on purpose.\"\n\"The monsters aren’t the issue here. If this energy reaches the capital, then...!\"\nThe Evileye General cowered at the interrogation. It would’ve been nice if they had managed to kill Lee Shin Woo before all this was revealed, but Lee Shin Woo had seen through her plan! Lee Shin Woo clapped his hands and calmed everyone down.\n\"Now, let’s collect some of the energy. We also need to form a barrier to stop the energy from leaking; a temporary one works too. It’s no time to be going around abandoned dungeons and playing hero anymore.\"\nAll eyes were on Lee Shin Woo. The Evileye General looked like she was about to cry.\n\"This is a holy war. A holy war between us and those trying to turn us into the undead!\"\nThus, Lee Shin Woo had become commander of the surface’s undead resistance force in place of the incompetent God.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 42 part6",
    "content": "<Chapter 42. Sun God’s Hero - 6>\nTemporarily sealing off the leak went smoothly, as some of the members of the God of Life religion were skilled in sealing magic.\nPlus, the priests of the other religions supported them with their own skills and magic, so they were able to plug up the hole and prevent the undead curse from leaking. Lee Shin Woo was surprised to see that and was especially surprised at their ability to seal a portion of the curse into a small container with said sealing techniques.\n\"What a nice ability.\"\n\"It would’ve been nice if we were a tad bit stronger, but this is our limit. But at the very least, we were able to strengthen the seal with the help of your magic, Sir Kay. Thank you very much.\"\nThe priests of the God of Life religion didn’t respect the Pope, yet they were well-behaved in front of Lee Shin Woo. At this point, they were almost revering him, but Lee Shin Woo decided not to let it bother him. Since his title as the Sun God’s hero wouldn’t be enough to unite all of the surface’s forces in their fight against the undead. However, this was a good enough position to do start on that.\n\"Please don’t forget what happened today. This awful mana... You must not make light of this energy of death. This isn’t something that can be solved by a few sacrifices. We all have to work together.\"\n\"I agree with Kay. I believe the Sun God sent Kay to us in order to deal with this threat. Please lend us your strength. I promise that each religion will be rewarded appropriately for their deeds.\"\nThe Pope’s attitude wasn’t much different from Lee Shin Woo’s, but there were differences in core areas. His words were swaying all those present, and it was also coaxing the leaders of the three religious orders as well; the three religious leaders nodded their heads.\n\"Of course.\"\n\"Pope. You don’t even need to ask. We trust Sir Kay.\"\n\"It’s a bit strange to say that we trust him. It’s more precise to say that there’s no reason for someone with such strength to lie to us.\"\nHey, wait. It wasn’t just reverence, but a full blown religion! Lee Shin Woo was surprised and went into a cold sweat, as the situation had progressed so smoothly.\nYet, the Evileye General, Shurina Von Hegel, bit her lower lip and gazed at Lee Shin Woo. However, she looked at him warmly. Her type (the one who couldn’t hide what they were thinking) was so easy to trick! Of course, Lee Shin Woo was the swindler!\n’If I can coax her, then I should be able to acquire some information on the other 12 Generals.’\nOf course, Rem was providing him with general information on them through the golem network, but it would be different to hear it from one of the 12 Generals themselves.\nMoreover, if things went well, he could learn more about the Magic Emperor as well. If he could, he’d like to know more about the Emperor prior to meeting him.\n’You’re thinking about something evil again, aren’t you?’\n’No I’m not.’ Thɪs chapter is updatᴇd by ɴovelfire.net\nInitiating a sexual relationship would be best, but... Jin’s gaze was scary, so he decided against it.\nLooking at her now, he felt like he could control her if he just picked up one of her weaknesses. His relationship with her would go in a different direction from the religious members, which was worsened by the fact that she didn’t think of him as human.\n\"Then, let’s go back. You’ll be really busy from here on out.\"\n\"If it’s to stop the coming catastrophe, then... We’ll do whatever it takes.\"\n\"...Kuheuk.\"\nThey sealed the hole and were on their way back to the capital. The religions had broken down all barriers and became close. They didn’t speak to the Evileye General or her troops, as if they’d made a promise prior (what’s worse, the soldiers were too weak to even enter the dungeon).\nThey wouldn’t allow the Emperor’s forces to get in their way. Although they wouldn’t be able to exclude the Emperor’s forces in such an important matter, they would only allow them to join once the Emperor had acknowledged his mistake.\n...And in the process, the Evileye General would be subject to ridicule. To be honest, they had already considered her a corpse. At that point, Lee Shin Woo quietly spoke to the Pope.\n\"Pope. Could you please leave her to me?\"\n\"You... I know you don’t have a lover, but are you really going to go after one of the 12 Generals? I know she’s good-looking and all, but everything else is a trap.\"\n\"Sir Kay, there’s no need for one such are yourself to desire such a dirty woman! A dog of the royal family is not fit to be by the side of one who can wield a god’s power...!\"\n\"...Haha.\"\nThe Pope reacting like that wasn’t anything new, but Maria Eldaletz had, at some point, come over and was pissed. Her, the Evileye General, and every other strong young woman he’d met were all the same: they couldn’t hide their feelings. Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and said.\n\"That’s not why I’m approaching her. You never know what one will do when they’re at risk of death. If possible, I want her to help us. We should be able to help each other out.\"\n\"...I’m not sure if I’ve told you before, but I’d like to say it again. I’m glad we’re not enemies.\"\n\"As expected of you, Sir Kay. You had such a plan ready...!\"\nAh, this won’t do. The Shining Flame’s buff was way too strong, so they took it positively, regardless of what he said! They should be glaring at him instead!\nLee Shin Woo felt burdened by them and did his best to avoid their gaze. When he locked eyes with the Evileye General, she shrieked and turned her head away from him. Mm, her mental state was so fragile right now that it’d break if he just gave her a slight nudge.\n’Let’s get away from the General following us and then talk.’\nThat would be simple with the use of his Wild Card and Disguise skills. Lee Shin Woo had successfully relayed his message, and the Evileye General, who was at a loss, had cried and accepted his offer. After that, the party reached the capital and the various factions split and went their separate ways.\n\"Mr. Shin Woo, you came back safely!\"\n[Paul Zero! I’m so glad you’re safe. You’re even stronger than before?]\n\"Of course I am. Ah... Sorry, but I think things will be even more hectic than before, so stop with the cute act for now. You can do it all you want later. I’d like to hear your report first.\"\nLee Shin Woo, having safely returned to his residence within the capital, was met by Sinea and Ye Jin Jin rushing towards him. However, he somewhat cold-heartedly restrained them, and then learned of what had happened while he was away.\nTransferring the newly born spirits to the Spirits’ Spring was going smoothly due to Sinea and the other spirits’ efforts, but there was a problem with his shop. He had expected this, but someone was openly sabotaging his shop.\nNot only were there several people messing with his shop, but the key members of the Empire were discreetly aiding the Lawrence shop’s competitors. But because Bisher Moon had mobilized his workers and taken certain precautions, they were able to weather the storm.\n\"But you should have nothing to worry about soon. Public opinion will side with us, and above all, the other religions will support the Lawrence shop as well.\"\n\"How did that happen!?\"\n\"To put it simply... You could see it as all the forces, aside from the Emperor’s, have joined a single team. Since the undead curse isn’t just a threat to us heroes.\"\n[That’s not simple at all, Paul Zero!]\n\"Mr. Shin Woo. You’re so amazing...!\"\nHe hadn’t even told him about the innate elements that he’d acquired, yet Sinea and Ye Jin Jin’s eyes were already sparkling. At this point, Lee Shin Woo barely realized that something was off, and as a result of his self-diagnosis, he confirmed that something was indeed wrong.\nWhen he leveled up, he gained the innate skill, Wild Card, which was always active. But it turns out that it not only buffed all of his skills, abilities, etc... but also had a hugely positive effect on all of his words and actions! In other words, it had evolved into a cheat skill!\n’The skill really fits me and my ’level’ as a Joker has increased, but still, what the hell is this? It seems like my ’level’ as a human has gone down.’\nLee Shin Woo felt a bit down and shook his head, but then, Jin retorted, who was the only one that had remained calm. Since this is something that he needed to hear, he was here too.\n\"But Shin Woo, do you really need to rely on the shop anymore?\"\nIf Lee Shin Woo added his Dark Shadow to his Disguise skill, then he could reduce Jin’s body to less than half. To be honest, he could do even more, now that he’d acquired Wild Card and Dark Shadow, but he was keeping that for later. Lee Shin Woo needed to prepare himself too.\n\"Yeah, I don’t really need it since I’ve cemented my position as the hero Kay. But in the future, the Lawrence shop will probably be more beneficial to us than Kay’s name.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\"Mm. I’m talking about after we’ve eliminated the curse and have dealt with the trouble on the surface. ...It’d probably be difficult for us to return to our original worlds. So, we have no choice but to continue to live on the surface. You get me thus far, right?\"\n\"Yes, of course.\"\nThe reason Lee Shin Woo was preventing the undead curse from spreading to the surface was not only because he didn’t want his enemies to increase, but mostly because he didn’t want to live in a world filled with death. That would be a stagnant world, unable to move forward! Ye Jin Jin probably thought the same.\n\"But if we just protect the world, we lose out. I’m protecting this shop so that we have a way to enter the world without using force. Since money and status are the best for living happily in peace. And the shop lets us gain both.\"\n\"You were thinking that far ahead? ...Then, you must’ve planned for me to be your representative a long time ago.\"\nYe Jin Jin seemed to be misunderstanding something and blushed in happiness. Of course, there was no way Lee Shin Woo thought that far ahead. Disguising himself as a merchant and figuring out the surface had gone a lot better than expected, so he’d changed his objective. That’s all!\nBut for some reason Ye Jin Jin was really touched, so he decided to just let her think whatever she wanted.\n\"In any case, we can just leave the shop as is. So... what about the Red Moon?\"\n\"They’re currently fighting against our Moon Shadow.\"\nThat made sense. If Bisher Moon were inside the capital then there was no way he wouldn’t know about Lee Shin Woo’s return. He had felt it was strange that Bisher hadn’t come to see him, but it seemed like he was busy fighting off the Red Moon.\n\"By the way... Mr. Shin Woo, if we don’t have to worry about the shop from now on, can I fight against the Red Moon too? If we have to move only at night, I can do that.\"\n\"I’ll allow it once you’ve reached level 7. ...Anyway, I plan on going back down soon, so will you be ok?\"\n\"I thought about it, but there’s a lot more I can do up here than down there. If you’re not here, then I’ll be here in your stead.\"\nYe Jin Jin had made her decision. Since she was drinking plenty of medicine because of his trickery, she would soon become strong enough to move around safely without fear.\nIt might be tough on her, as her stats had increased while her skills had not, but her stats should supplement her long-range spear throwing, and if need be, her ability to run away...\n\"Ah.\"\n\"Huh? What’s wrong?\"\n\"Mm... It’s nothing. Really, it’s nothing.\"\nThe Evileye General, Shurina Von Hegel’s eyes would be a good fit for Ye Jin Jin, but it was a little too late to be changing his strategy. After all, he’d decided to use her to gain information on the Emperor.\nMoreover, Lee Shin Woo had no taste in deliberately killing someone weaker than him, especially when they had no intention of harming him. If she were a monster, he would’ve killed her without any hesitation...\n\"I’ll go to the secret shop later and see if there’re any similar abilities or artifacts... Oh, right.\"\nAt that moment, someone softly knocked on his mansion’s front door. Could he really not become a noble? Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and stood up.\n\"We have a visitor. A really important one at that.\"",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 42 part7",
    "content": "<Chapter 42. Sun God’s Hero - 7 [End of Volume 10]>\nThe Evileye General, Shurina Von Hegel, entered his residence discreetly, as if she didn’t want to be seen, and instead of giving Lee Shin Woo a friendly greeting, she said...\n\"Honestly, the best way you can help me is by letting me kill you.\"\n\"You wouldn’t be able to kill me, even if you brought all of the 12 Generals. You’re well aware of this, so you came alone, no?\"\n\"...Yes.\"\nLee Shin Woo grinned at the Evileye General, who’d suffered a total loss. She had been watching him while hiding out of sight... Her eyes were so sharp that they resembled that of a killer’s, but it wasn’t surprising anymore, so he just ignored it.\n\"Let’s start with the situation you’re in. I’ve heard. Apparently, you’re in a bit of a pickle, right?\"\n\"Who do you think is responsible for all this... Keuk. Anyway, you’re right. I’m being watched. Me, one of the 12 Generals. You have no idea how hard it was to sneak over here unnoticed!\"\nDid she really come unnoticed? Lee Shin Woo tilted his head, expanded his senses, and scanned the surrounding area. Nothing bad would happen even if she had been discovered, but... as she said, no one had followed her, as per her title of as one of the 12 Generals.\nAt this point, she was almost crying, and Lee Shin Woo smiled softly.\n\"It must’ve been tough on you. So, who can you trade for your life?\"\n\"I... originally held the lowest seat amongst the 12 Generals. As you well know, I possess a special ability, so I was assigned to every important battle. But because I didn’t have enough strength to protect myself, I wasn’t able to go very far. My subordinates suffered the same fate, and they’re not in the best position right now...\"\nIn other words, there was no one she could even sell out. This part made her swell with emotion, as her eyes brimmed with tears.\nCoercing her didn’t seem like the best course of action, as she would be just more intimidated than before. Therefore, Lee Shin Woo decided to increase their level of intimacy first.\n\"Then let’s talk. How much I can help you depends on what information you can give me.\"\n\"Keuk...!\"\n\"There’s no rush. Why don’t you drink a cup of tea?\"\nThe Evileye General felt slightly immoral for selling out her country, but... Lee Shin Woo’s tea was so warm that it made her forget the situation she was in, and ended up relying upon that warmth.\nEven if she was the lowest seat, she was still one of the 12 Generals. She ended up telling him one or two things that he couldn’t find out through the golem network. Moreover, this new info mixed with his old info, giving him more insight. And there was something particularly interesting amongst the information...\n\"Hmm, so the Emperor hasn’t made an official appearance in years.\"\n\"Yes. The only ones who can see him are the 12 Generals and a small handful of high rank bureaucrats. But we can only see him at a certain time and at a certain place. I’ve never met him in the daytime.\"\n\"...Hmm.\"\nLearning about the Emperor’s appearance was huge. Information regarding the Emperor was top secret... and Lee Shin Woo felt like he was really suspicious.\n\"Of course, His Majesty is a remarkable individual, so we have no idea what he wants or what he’s thinking about... But those who slander his name are coming up with all kinds of false rumors. For example...\"\n\"For example, the Emperor’s a Vampire. Something like that?\"\n\"Gah!\"\nThe Evileye General stiffened. Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and continued.\n\"He only operates at night, so anyone would think he’s a Vampire. So what is he for real?\"\n\"You’ll pay if His Majesty finds out that you’ve put him in the same boat as the undead! He’s a human. His complexion and even his mana are completely human as well...!\"\n\"Despite that, the rumors that he’s a Vampire won’t cease. Aren’t you at least a little suspicious?\"\n\"Ugh.\"\nThe Evileye General stiffened once more. She was sensitive to any unfavorable remark made about the Emperor, as if she had been brainwashed.\nAt that moment, an alarm rang in his head. The feeling got even stronger, so he scanned his surroundings, but there was no one here ’besides the Evileye General’.\n\"That’s... They just don’t know how great His Majesty truly is, and aren’t aware of what’s in store for them. His Majesty is an Archmage and has realized something we haven’t, so we cannot judge him...\"\nHearing that, Lee Shin Woo had already considered the Emperor a Vampire, or considered other possibilities that might apply.\nBefore, when he’d gotten the report from Bisher Moon regarding the Red Moon, he had been surprised by how bold the Vampire had been, but... if the Emperor himself was also a Vampire, everything mades sense.\n’If that’s the case, then God wasn’t referring to the Undead Emperor, but to the...’\nShe’s said that the Emperor had sought immortality. What if she was referring to the Magic Emperor, not the undead one? Perhaps part of the reason for the rapid progress of golem development was for that very purpose.\nAnd if that’s true, then it explains the Emperor’s current appearance, the immense magic he sensed from the far-off palace, and the Red Moon, which controls the capital at night. Lee Shin Woo thought and scoffed.\n’Their goals are completely different, but their means are similar. This is no laughing matter. As expected of brothers...’\nThe Crown Prince had banished the 2nd prince hundreds of years ago, so he’d thought that perhaps the current Magic and Undead Emperors were different, but with what he knew now, he discarded all such thoughts.\nLee Shin Woo was sure that the surface and underground were ruled by the Crown Prince and the 2nd prince respectively. Nothing else would explain their lunacy and obsession.\n’But if that’s true, then... Does the Emperor not care if the others become undead? Is that why he just left the death energy as is? But what if the undead underground were to invade the surface? It didn’t make sense that he wouldn’t have something prepared. It seemed fine for now, as the undead curse was the only thing surfacing, while the undead themselves seemed to have no intention of invading...\nBut Lee Shin Woo was confused about something. The undead had overcome their greatest obstacle by becoming the undead, so why hadn’t the Undead Emperor ordered his forces to invade the surface yet? What exactly was stopping him?\nWas it Arema Steelworker? Seagald Von Retadane? Though they were forces independent of the Emperor’s, they only held one of the 12 General positions a piece. On the other hand, the Emperor possessed the Archmage, as well as the remaining 12 Generals, so it made absolutely no sense that he couldn’t come up to the surface because of them.\n’But it’s not like I can go and ask the Archmage, ’Hey, why aren’t you guys going to the surface?’.’\n\"Why aren’t you asking anything else? Did you get everything you wanted... If not, then are you thinking about something that she can’t answer?\" Official source ıs novel(ꜰ)ire.net\nAt that moment, the Evileye General (who sat in front of him) said something out of the blue. The mood, which Lee Shin Woo had been controlling, had changed.\n\"...What?\"\nThis time, Lee Shin Woo was surprised. Her body and voice hadn’t changed, yet... the quality of her magic had changed! Moreover, Lee Shin Woo was somewhat familiar with that magic. He narrowed his eyes and voiced his assumption.\n\"Darkness magic... The Emperor?\"\n\"If you were that curious about me, then you should’ve come to see me yourself. You see, I hate incompetent individuals like the owner of this body, but I like people overflowing with talent like yourself. Indeed, whenever, wherever.\"\nLee Shin Woo raised his head and looked straight at the Evileye General. He sensed darkness mana deep within the recesses of her eyes. It was an unseverable relationship that he must have made beforehand.\nLee Shin Woo had experienced this before; by giving one’s name, an unbreakable link would be formed. And this link was formed between the Evileye General and the Emperor.\n\"Ha, so the Evileye General was disposable from the very beginning.\"\n\"She had a chance. But she wasted it. The contract is absolute, but she didn’t realize that. How unfortunate.\"\nThe Magic Emperor spoke brazenly with the Evileye General’s face and voice and shook his head. Lee Shin Woo snorted and simultaneously analyzed his mana. He came to an immediate conclusion. It was an innate element.\nDarkness and... probably the lightning element. It would be simple to call it the ’Dark Lightning’ element, but the dark lightning he felt from the Emperor wasn’t so simple. Lightning’s speed, power, and conductivity... It felt like he’d developed it in a completely different direction. And it was probably what was allowing the Emperor to perform such a feat.\n\"Do you all get such unique abilities when you reach level 9?\"\n\"Hoh. You saw through my Lightning Bind with one glance. I suppose that makes sense. Since you managed to kill the divine bird that was on par with me...\"\n\"Now that we’re at it, let me ask you something. How did you imprison it?\"\nHe didn’t ask because he was really curious. When he absorbed the Garuda’s bone, he’d know then. But he wanted to ask a good question to buy him some more time.\n\"Oh, I thought you’d ask me about that.\"\nWas it because he was sure that he was stronger than him? The Emperor answered happily. Perhaps the Emperor was still underestimating him, he who had defeated the divine bird that had escaped its imprisonment.\n\"Its innate element responds when it recognizes external stimuli. If that’s the case, then you make it so that it can’t recognize it. If you prevent it from moving, then the next step is simple. You must’ve felt it, but my power, Lighting Bind, is quite powerful in that regard. Since you didn’t even notice that you’d been affected yourself.\"\n\"Yeah, you’re right.\"\nLee Shin Woo hadn’t been able to move his body ever since the Emperor had shown up.\nIt would probably be easy to dispel with his innate elements, whether it be his Dark Shadow, Dark Flame, or his Shining Flame, but he was deliberately not doing so. If he did, the Emperor would just restrain him again.\nThis space was already filled with the Emperor’s magic. It might be different if he had been facing another level 8, but it would be difficult for even him to take control of a level 9’s mana.\n\"Did you spread your mana all over the Empire?\"\n\"All the materials used to create the capital’s buildings and roads are subject to the palace’s approval. Each of those materials is saturated with mana, mana which I can change into my own whenever I wish. No one managed to figure it out, so don’t be so frustrated, Sun God’s hero, Kay.\"\nEven Lee Shin Woo couldn’t see through this elaborate trap. The Wild Card skill had its limitations. Lee Shin Woo couldn’t break through the barrier set up over hundreds of years and see through the Emperor’s mana.\nWas this a level 9’s power? Lee Shin Woo suddenly realized how wide the world was due to the Emperor’s ability and unfathomable method of controlling the capital. He’d heard from Kratia that a magician’s power would increase several times over within their workshop, but this bastard had turned the entire capital into his workshop...\n\"Do you have anything else you’d like to ask? As a parting gift, I’ll answer any questions you have.\"\n\"Why are you ignoring the undead curse? At this rate, the undead curse will spread to the Empire.\"\n\"Ho. You’re not going to ask if I’m a Vampire or what not?\"\n\"Since there’s no point.\"\nLee Shin Woo declared. He didn’t know how the Emperor took it, but he grinned and replied.\n\"You must think it’s so urgent, but that curse is still too weak. More people need to die to unite the Empire.\"\n\"...Hmm.\"\nDid he not get a report from Arema Steelworker regarding the undead curse? The true power of the curse lies in its ability to kill the world itself, not just living beings!\nNo. The Emperor, with his high rank innate darkness element, should be able to absorb all of the curse’s energy. If that’s the case, then he could understand why he was speaking so peacefully.\n\"Don’t worry. Everything is going according to plan. Humanity has been subject to danger a few times before, but each and every time we work together and overcome said danger. And every time, humanity dwindles in size and then repopulates itself. This is the way the world works. ...However, there’s one problem this time.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"It’s you. I was confident that with our golems, which are spread across the Empire, that we would know about all dangers and preempt them, but... I didn’t know about you, one who possesses enough power to clear a level 8 dungeon by yourself, beforehand. And because of that, my plan has gone a bit awry.\"\nThe Evileye General’s face became wrinkled. It didn’t fit a young woman’s face, but for some reason, he didn’t feel like it was strange. It must’ve been because of the mood.\n\"I thought long and hard before I came to see you, but I couldn’t understand. I struggled and looked at all the possibilities, but there was only one answer I came to... Though I couldn’t believe it myself.\"\nThen, the Emperor looked straight at Lee Shin Woo. The words that came next... Lee Shin Woo would probably never forget them.\n\"You’re a hero, but also an undead. God sent you like that, right? To spy on the surface and the underground!\"",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 43 part1",
    "content": "<Chapter 43. Return - 1>\n\"None can hide from me on the surface, especially if they’re strong. But that wasn’t the case with you. I formed several hypotheses, but none of them fit. Of them, there was only one remaining possibility: that you came from a place beyond my gaze. And that means you either came from another world or the underground...\"\n\"Hoh, what an interesting deduction.\"\n\"You may think that you’re the only hero here, but God has brought several heroes here from other worlds.\"\nNo, he already knew that. After all, there were two other heroes on the surface right now!\n\"But unfortunately, God’s summoning magic is too conspicuous. After the golem network was created, I would find and kill any hero summoned on the surface, unless one of God’s apostles secretly descended into the world.\"\nWait a sec... The surface, not the underground? This is the first time he’d heard about it. So God had sent heroes to the surface rather than the underground in the past? Why? In order to defeat the Magic Emperor, who assumed complete control over the Empire?\nOf course, just looking at the Emperor gave him some idea. The Underground Empire wasn’t the only problem. Both the surface and the underground had their fair share of problems!\n\"Hoo.\"\nThe Emperor noticed that Lee Shin Woo was beginning to listen, sported a disgusting smile fit for a middle-aged man, and continued.\n\"God can no longer send heroes to the surface. Thus, you came from underground. Moreover, the barrier doesn’t allow the living to pass through it, so you must be undead. But if you were one of the underground’s undead, then you wouldn’t have been able to leave...\"\n\"Mm...\"\nWait a sec. What he was saying was largely contradictory. On the outside, Lee Shin Woo acted calm, but he was actually quite shocked.\n’The hell is this guy saying?’\nLet’s say that the Emperor was talking about the barrier under the assumption that Lee Shin Woo came from the underground.\nBut what did he mean after that? If he were one of the underground’s undead, then he couldn’t have come out? Why not? They had gone through the trouble of turning themselves into the undead to pass through the barrier, so why couldn’t they leave?\nBut the Emperor spoke firmly and voiced his conclusion as if he were putting an end to Lee Shin Woo’s many questions.\n\"So I thought about it. If God wanted to nurture a hero without being noticed by me, then she would call them underground and transform them into an undead so that they could go through the barrier! Am I right? Undead hero!\"\n\"...Phew.\"\n\"Hoo. Not so relaxed now, hmm.\"\nOf course he wouldn’t be. Since it was so laughable! That probably wasn’t God’s plan when she made him an undead! He’d gotten it all wrong, yet he’d still come to the right conclusion: that he was an undead hero. Lee Shin Woo couldn’t suppress his admiration.\nWhereas, the Emperor, who couldn’t know what he was thinking, raised a hand towards Lee Shin Woo and stretched out his fingers (Lightning Bind, which restrained Lee Shin Woo’s movements, got even tighter). Then, he smiled in satisfaction.\n\"You fooled me with that disguise ability of yours... I acknowledge it. It’s impressive enough that even I cannot replicate it, but you were much too rash and arrogant. That’s why you failed.\"\n\"...I’d like to ask one last thing. How do you plan on killing me? I don’t know what you think of me, but I’m the one who killed that divine bird. You won’t be able to kill me through trivial means.\"\n\"Hoo. You’re still bluffing, even though you can’t even move a finger due to my Lightning Bind.\"\nThe Emperor smiled and refuted him. He must’ve thought what Lee Shin Woo was saying was ridiculous.\n\"It was called a divine bird long ago. But it was weakened by my barrier, the parasites, and the undead curse. You think I don’t know? That you could barely beat it by sacrificing all the Sun God religion’s paladins and priests?\"\n\"Mm.\"\nAs he thought. On the way back to the capital, Lee Shin Woo and the Pope had conversed discreetly. If his abilities were revealed, then the Emperor would be more wary of him than necessary, so they would spread rumors that not only was the divine bird weakened but that the Sun God religion had sacrificed its paladins and priests to defeat it.\nOf course, he didn’t doubt the Pope’s abilities, but those rumors had reached the Emperor in just one day. Not only that, the Emperor completely fell for it. Did the Evileye General not properly report to him?\nNo, the Emperor probably thought that she was exaggerating his abilities to save herself, and may not have completely trusted in her report.\n’Then that means... That innate element, Lightning Bind, was nothing more than the ability to connect himself with someone else whenever he wanted. This means he can’t read one’s mind, see the past, or get notified if something doesn’t make sense in his domain.’\nIts power was incredible, yes, but compared to his other innate elements, which could affect cause and effect, Lee Shin Woo felt like it was weaker. Was Lee Shin Woo the only one who thought that way? Perhaps the Emperor hadn’t even completely mastered the darkness element.\n’It looks perfect, but this guy’s information network is full of holes. It’s fine, now that I know.’\nThen again, the only thing he could interfere with was the status quo, so he’d so diligently created golems and spread them across the Empire. Moreover, it seemed like the Emperor wasn’t yet aware that Rem had taken control of those golems, so he couldn’t help but laugh.\nNo one other than Lee Shin Woo could’ve thought up something like this. With this, however, Lee Shin Woo was already above the Emperor. What the Emperor said next was proof of this.\n\"Shall I tell you what the biggest reason you were discovered was? Someone with the strength to match a divine bird couldn’t have been so easily ensnared by my ability. You’re the hero who defeated the divine bird one-on-one when you couldn’t even resist my ability and are just waiting for death? Haha, what a funny lie.\"\n\"If I die here, then it’ll become rough on you. You shouldn’t look down on the feelings of so many people.\"\nIt wasn’t a threat. He wasn’t trying to buy time either. He didn’t need to anymore anyway. He was just curious. Rumors of the dungeon and the undead curse were spreading throughout the capital, so if Lee Shin Woo were to die, everyone would suspect and hate the Emperor. So what was he thinking?\n\"That’s only temporary. Didn’t I tell you before? As time passes, the people have no choice but to fall back on the palace, on the absolute Emperor. Without you, the religious order cannot lead people. You... must be sacrificed to maintain public order.\"\n\"...\"\nAnother simple answer. This so-called Emperor placed way too much confidence in his power. He was speechless that a guy like this would be brazen enough to utter the word ’arrogant’.\nOf course, he possessed such absolute power, which enabled him to control the Empire. Moreover, he’d become a Vampire and thus immortal, so he could understand why the Emperor felt like he had nothing to fear... But it seemed like he still hadn’t realized it. That nothing lasts forever in the world.\n\"If I had my way, I would’ve destroyed Lawrence as well, but there’s no way a mere merchant can take your place. There should be no problem with just leaving him be.\"\n\"You shouldn’t look down on Lawrence.\"\nSince I’m Lawrence.\n\"Haha. I don’t look down on people. I make my decisions objectively. And if I’m acting confident, then there’s only one reason for that. ...It’s because I am the Emperor who rules over all creation!\"\nHaving said his piece, the Emperor tightly clenched his hand. The large quantity of mana enclosing Lee Shin Woo... No, the entire mansion converged onto Lee Shin Woo and exploded!\nAnd as a result, the Emperor... or the Evileye General was affected as well. She was dead the moment she’d picked Lee Shin Woo over the Emperor.\n- Saaa\nThe magic explosion muffled all sound, and the entire mansion was vaporized. In its place, the darkness of the capital flooded in and filled the area to the brim.\nThe only thing that proved that the Evileye General had been here was her skull... and soon, even that melted into the air and disappeared. Content orıginally comes from N()velFire.net\n[The Wild Card skill has become Lv2. All stats have increased by 30.]\n[The Beginner Dark Shadow element has become Lv5. Magic has increased by 20.]\n[The Acting skill has become Lv21. Your acting can even fool magic.]\n[You have acquired the Lv7 Evileye General, Shurina Von Hegel’s skull.]\n\"So in order to fool the Emperor, you’re hosting a hero get-together here?\"\nLee Shin Woo smiled at Pleine, who had pushed her head forward over the counter and looked speechless.\n\"It’s been a while. It’s nice to see you, Pleine. Haha.\"\n\"It’s nice to see you too... Wait a sec! That’s not what I want to say!\"\n\"Wow. That scary shop lady’s talking so proudly...!\"\n[Was I able to enter because we formed an official contract? It’s a really interesting space.]\n[So Lee Shin Woo, who is that woman!? I sense divinity from her!]\nThat’s right. Lee Shin Woo’s entire party was in the secret shop right now. To be more specific, Lee Shin Woo, who’d sensed the Emperor’s visit, had sent everyone else to the secret shop. Then, he’d spoken with the Emperor and come to the secret shop after.\n\"I can’t believe you acted in front of the Emperor and managed to fool him.\"\n\"Well, that’s my karma. Ah, and because he was using the Evileye General’s body, he couldn’t control his magic perfectly, which is one of the reasons that I could deal with him so easily. That Lightning Bind element or whatnot didn’t seem like it was at a very high level either.\"\nAnd what were his countless reasons? He had several ways of dealing with the situation, but he’d chosen Wild Card and Dark Shadow this time around. The Emperor said it, didn’t he? That there was no way someone powerful enough to fight the divine bird head-to-head wouldn’t be able to resist his Lightning Bind.\nHe was right. The Emperor believed that he was restraining Lee Shin Woo with his Lightning Bind, but what he was actually restraining was Lee Shin Woo’s armor. If Lee Shin Woo had completely understood the Emperor’s innate element, then his armor wouldn’t have been restrained by his opponent’s magic either.\n\"The next step was easy. When he unleashed that magic explosion, I used Dark Shadow to twist cause and effect, focusing the explosive power onto the Evileye General. I hid my body within the darkness, took the Evileye General’s bone, and then came here, to the secret shop.\"\nWhen one reaches the peak of the darkness element, doing something like this became possible. Lee Shin Woo waved his hand as if he were bragging. His hand softly melted into the darkness, flickered, and then returned to its original form. Seeing that, Pleine shook even more.\n\"What’s worse, you came without any permits! You shouldn’t just come in here whenever you want with the Heaven Door’s Key!\"\n\"Well, it couldn’t be helped. Since I don’t have any permits left...\"\nWhen he came to the surface, the Heaven Door’s Key had eaten all of his permits, and he hadn’t gained any on the surface. If Ye Jin Jin didn’t have any permits left, then he would’ve had to use the Heaven Door’s Key to get them here, but if he did, the Emperor would’ve known.\n\"We’re not going to stay for very long, so just look the other way this time. If I had been properly rewarded for my actions on the surface, then I would’ve had permits to spare.\"\n\"Ah, nothing makes sense anymore...\"\nLee Shin Woo looked at the grief-stricken shop owner and grinned. Then, he suddenly thought of something. The one thing the Emperor had said that had bothered him.\n\"Pleine, I’d like to ask you something.\"\n\"I can’t promise you that I’ll answer it, but go ahead.\"\n\"Why hasn’t the Undead Emperor gone to the surface when he can supposedly go through the barrier by being undead?\"\n\"...\"\nPleine’s eyes became empty. Lee Shin Woo spoke even more forcefully.\n\"Can’t you tell me at least this much? I deserve to hear it.\"\n\"...You should already know the answer to that question, Mr. Shin Woo.\"\nPleine responded with a bitter smile. Immediately after, she said something so simple and clear... the despondent truth.\n\"It’s because the undead cannot move forward.\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 43. Return - 2>\n\"B-But...\"\n\"But what? You already knew this, Mr. Shin Woo. That all the undead in the Underground Empire have stagnated. Even if they raise their levels, their ’existence’ won’t change...\"\nThere was no doubt about it, so when she said the unthinkable, he fumbled with his words.\n\"But don’t the undead have a clear sense of identity? Like the Archmage. Compared to most humans, he’s much more...\"\n\"Mr. Shin Woo, an undead’s sense of identity or their intellect has no bearing on their true identity. It doesn’t matter how rational or knowledgeable they are; having a clear goal doesn’t matter either. Because the undead are irrevocably tied to the past, they cannot see the future. And they cannot even act in the present. That is their ’identity’, which they cannot escape from.\"\nLee Shin Woo was struck by a dull shock. He could understand it mentally. That’s exactly what individuality and identity meant. No matter how skilled one was, they couldn’t go against their natural instincts.\nAnd to the undead, that instinct was ’stagnation’. The undead didn’t want to change. They wanted to stay in the same place and repeat things over and over again. Lee Shin Woo could understand. At least, he thought he could understand, but... he really didn’t get it.\n\"How... How can that be? The Undead Emperor is level 9. The Archmage is not only level 8 like me, but understands mana much better than I do. What’s worse, he knows spatial magic, so he can get through the barrier whenever he wants...\"\n\"It’s because they’ve become undead. They must’ve stayed underground for far too long. They have become unable to go to the surface.\"\n\"...\"\n\"They forever remember the day that they were banished, and they hate everything on the surface. They want to tear the Magic Emperor to pieces, but... Despite that, they wish to remain underground. You must accept it, even if it doesn’t make sense. It’s their natural instinct, just like eating is necessary for humans to survive.\"\nHow pitiful. Lee Shin Woo briefly thought that they did nothing wrong. They researched a way to get out, and made themselves into the undead, yet... As a result, they were unable to escape and were trapped underground. How ironic.\n\"Come to think of it, God told me that I had to kill the Emperor to stop the ’spread of the undead curse’. She didn’t say, ’they might come to the surface, so stop them’.\"\n\"Yes. For her part, she didn’t lie to you about that from the very beginning. It was also something she couldn’t hide from you.\"\nIt was so obvious that he’d forgotten at some point. He’d stopped thinking at a crucial moment. No, he’d thought that the fearsome undead weren’t affected by logic and could do whatever they wanted.\n’I can understand why the Magic Emperor wasn’t worried. He should’ve gotten a report from Arema Steelworker on the Undead Emperor’s movements, so he would be sure that the Undead Emperor isn’t going to invade the surface. That must be why the surface dispatched heroes at first, but then stopped soon after.’\nHe’d finally solved the puzzle. There were still some mysteries he hadn’t solved yet, but he could just look into those in the Underground Empire. Like the actual goal of General Seagald’s Anti-Skull...\n’What a pain in the ass. That guy’s goal might be different from what I first suspected...’\n\"Mr. Shin Woo. You’re not thinking something strange, are you? Something like, ’I’ll send all of the undead to the surface myself.’\"\n\"Oh, nice idea.\"\n\"Mr. Shin Woo!?\"\n\"I’m just joking around.\"\nPleine was startled and yelled. Lee Shin Woo grinned and tried to calm her down, but it didn’t work. She must have some deep-rooted feelings.\n\"When God made you into an undead, she granted you a little bit of divinity to erase the undead’s ’identity’. It was a desperate attempt on her part, but it worked a lot better than she could have hoped. But to think you’d be able to do the same with other undead...\"\n\"Ah, as I thought.\"\nLee Shin Woo was talented in using the darkness element, and was even able to make the Pauls his subordinates when he was at a low level, making them freer than before. They prioritized his orders, but they had no other restraints.\nIn other words, they weren’t stagnant like the other undead in the Empire. They were freed from the past and were capable of moving forward.\n\"So I thought you might take the Empire’s side and lead them to the surface...\"\n\"Putting the deceased on the proper path, huh... That sounds pretty cool.\"\n\"You wouldn’t be putting them on the proper path, but on the path to ruin!\"\nIt was a joke, of course. To repeat, Lee Shin Woo didn’t want to live in a world filled with death. But this plan showed him some actors that he could control on his stage. Since ancient times, there was nothing better than a foreign enemy to unite the people.\nIf he controlled the situation properly, then he could lead it in a favorable direction for him. His vague plans, which he’d formed upon coming to the surface and acting as Kay, were being adjusted in his head.\n\"...Haha. It’s become quite interesting.\"\n\"Haha. Your ominous smile is making me shake all over.\"\nWhen he was level 7, he may have had some special abilities, but he was still at a much ’lower level’ than Pleine. But by reaching level 8, his existence had fundamentally changed. As a result, he became almost on par with God’s representative, Pleine.\nShe still beat him in terms of pure magic and power, but he was ahead of her in terms of his authority. It seemed like Lee Shin Woo was still unaware of this, but Pleine had noticed.\n’No matter how talented he is, or whether he was bestowed divinity or not, I didn’t expect him to max out one of his elements already. It’s much more surprising than learning a high rank element! But what is his element? I can’t tell with just the energy it’s emitting...!’\nOf course, she didn’t say all that. She didn’t want Lee Shin Woo to be biased or conceited about his own abilities. He would continue to grow at a rapid pace, and if she said something now and affected that growth, then she wouldn’t be able to take it back.\n\"Alright, I get it. In the end, my job hasn’t changed much.\"\n\"If you’re willing, I’d like to hear what the job of yours entails... You won’t tell me, will you?\"\n\"You can just watch and enjoy, Pleine.\"\n\"Will I really be able to enjoy it...\"\n\"Jin Jin, come over here.\"\n\"Y-Yes!\"\nWas she intimidated by the sight of them talking so intimately? After they’d deepened their relationship, she acted close to him too, but she walked over stiffly, as if she’d forgotten all about that. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and asked.\n\"Are you still far from level 7?\"\n\"Ah, no. I’m not close if you look at my combat experience, but I achieved a lot of feats in the Underground Empire, so I gained a lot of stats. And as you know, I used a lot of the money I got from working as Lawrence’s representative to buy medicine...\"\n\"You bought it and...?\"\n\"I need about 1,000 stats to reach level 7.\"\n\"So you’re still not there yet... But it’s a relief. You’re farther along than I thought.\"\nShe had grown a lot, considering the fact that she had been at the tail end of level 5 when she came up to the surface. If the other heroes knew about this, then they would’ve wrung her neck. She had grown faster than he did when he was at her level. However...\n’Hoo. She’s my own creation, so this much is expected.’\nLee Shin Woo knew how diligently she’d been working. If she had just taken what he had given her for free, then she wouldn’t have grown so much.\nTo achieve a feat, one needed to be proactive, no matter how little it was. If she hadn’t tried so hard, then she wouldn’t have achieved it. And she probably hadn’t been lax on her skill training either.\nShe’d ’ground her bones’ [1] to catch up to Lee Shin Woo, if even a little. But Lee Shin Woo was made up of nothing but bones, so it wasn’t enough!\n\"...You’ve nurtured another hero quite well.\"\nPleine, who was listening to their conversation from the side, was astonished. But Lee Shin Woo shook his head, as if displeased.\n\"In case I had to leave Jin Jin on the surface alone, I wanted to get her to level 7. But that damn Emperor came looking for me and messed up my plans. So going back there isn’t such a good idea, and though it’s not ideal, I have no choice but to proceed like this...\"\n\"Why isn’t it a good idea?\"\n\"In a sense, me ’dying’ is good for me.\"\nLee Shin Woo explained the current situation, as well as what he would do in the future to Ye Jin Jin, who was tilting her head, and the rest of his party.\n\"The Emperor destroyed the Lawrence mansion, fully prepared to take a hit to his reputation. My fame went up significantly, and the fear and animosity towards the undead curse increased as well. The person at the center of all that was killed, so everyone will direct their anger towards the Emperor.\"\n\"That’s true.\"\nThe Emperor said he was prepared for all that. He added that the people had no choice but to rely on the Emperor. And he was right. As long as things continued as they were, that is. Thɪs chapter is updatᴇd by novel·fiɾe·net\n\"But what would happen if I came out and said ’Actually, I’m alive.’? Of course, the people would be happy, but that forces me into a fight against the Emperor. Since I ’came back to life’, the Emperor will consider me his mortal enemy, and it’ll become hard to move around afterwards, so... It’d become really, really tough on me.\"\n\"But you said that it couldn’t go on like this.\"\n\"Yeah. So I’ll set up Kay’s replacement. That’s you.\"\nHearing that, Ye Jin Jin looked extremely confused.\n\"But I’m already Lawrence’s representative...\"\n\"Lawrence will come forward. Lawrence, angered by his friend’s death, will do everything in his power to keep his friend’s wishes alive. Together with you, who is both Lawrence’s and Kay’s representative. If we tell people that you’re not just business savvy, but you were trained by Kay, have great power, and can wield flames, then wouldn’t that make quite the story?\"\n\"...It’s such a great story that I feel like a story depicting the love triangle between Kay, Lawrence, and Izuna (Ye Jin Jin’s false name) will come out.\"\n\"Exactly. It’ll draw people’s attention. If that happens, then those who supported me will support you and Lawrence. You see, if they harm you, the successor to Kay’s name and beliefs, then the Empire will break down completely.\"\nHonestly, that crazy Vampire Emperor may damn the risks and try to kill Ye Jin Jin anyway. So, he would need to set up some countermeasures just in case.\n\"It seems like the perfect plan. However, Mr. Shin Woo... Aren’t there actually two huge problems with that plan?\"\nYe Jin Jin, who was deeply absorbed by what he was saying (acting in Lee Shin Woo’s stead felt romantic to her), pointed out some flaws in his plan, as if she felt really bad for doing so.\n\"First off, Lawrence is one of your names, Mr. Shin Woo. But you’re going back to the Underground Empire, aren’t you?\"\n\"From now on, Bisher Moon will become Lawrence. Not only has Lawrence never officially appeared, but through my influence, Bisher has become able to disguise himself freely, so he can play the part of Lawrence. Moreover, he can more freely connect the Lawrence shop and Moon Shadow together, so there’s no better choice.\"\n\"Now that you mention it... But even you can’t fix the second problem, Mr. Shin Woo.\"\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\"It’s me. Me!\"\nLee Shin Woo looked oblivious and Ye Jin Jin ultimately looked at him with a half-crying face and yelled.\n\"I’m not as strong as you and I can’t wield flames! You even told me to get to level 7, but I couldn’t even do that. Mm, even though I tried my best. I really did my best...!\"\n\"That’s ok.\"\n\"That’s ok!?\"\nLee Shin Woo took out an artifact from his chest, and once he did, it drew everyone’s attention. They had no choice but to pay attention to it.\n[Phoenix’s Feather]\n[Lv9]\n[Durability: So long as one ember remains, it self-repairs itself]\n[Defense: 2,500 - 3,500]\n[Element: Fire Lv8]\n[Options: All stats increase by 100, Magic increases by an additional 100, you take no fire damage, you take no critical damage, automatic health recovery, and level 8 fire is added to every one of the wielder’s attacks]\n[Special passive skill: Sun God’s Breath - By storing enough fire mana, the wielder can concentrate the flames and discharge it whenever they wish.]\n[Special active skill: Sun God’s Blessing - When the wielder dies, the wielder can defy death once through the use of the flames that burn away cause and effect and return to life. The one who revives through this effect receives the Sun God’s blessing.]\nThe soft dress boasted greater defensive capabilities than any of the armor within his possession. Plus, it increased one’s stats by a crazy amount, and it would even add an element to one’s attacks, increasing one’s offensive abilities. It was the whole package, excelling in both offense and defense.\nIt was the greatest inheritance left behind by the divine bird, the Garuda... What’s worse, it was the first time God’s representative, Pleine, had ever seen a level 9 piece of equipment.\n[1] T/N: Ground one’s bones is a Korean idiom. It means to feel unbearable pain and/or work incredibly hard.",

    "content": "<Chapter 43. Return - 3>\n\"Y-You’re going to... give this to me?\"\n\"Yep. Well, I’m not exactly giving it to you, but lending it to you.\" Get full chapters from novel⁂fire.net\nIt was a level 9 artifact, so just giving it to her wouldn’t have a good effect on her karma.\nHe could barely even lend it to her, as the item’s level was much too high, but... by using his Dark Shadow and Wild Card skills, he was able to make up for her deficiencies.\n\"What?! Mr. Shin Woo, this is the best item I’ve ever seen! How could you hand it out so casually?!\"\n\"I pretty much have no way of using it right now, so I decided to give it to Jin Jin, who can use it effectively.\"\nPleine, who was watching from the side, widened her eyes and tried to stop him, but Lee Shin Woo just shrugged.\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo was well aware of how amazing the Phoenix’s Feather was... It didn’t matter that it was more geared towards women. If he were to absorb it, he could adjust it to a form that suited him.\n’But that’s the problem. I can’t.’\nWith a little more study, his Bone Reinforcement, Rule of Bone, or Bone Armory skills may evolve to even greater heights. However, that wasn’t happening anytime soon. These skills wouldn’t be able to alter an artifact that the level 9 divine bird, the Garuda, dropped.\n\"Still... Do I even have the right to accept this? I-I’m scared. If something happens to me and I can’t return it, then... Especially this special active skill! You can only use it once, but if I were to waste it...!\"\n\"That ability’s why I’m giving you this item. Think about it. The Sun God’s Blessing is ultimately the Garuda’s blessing. But I killed the Garuda, so will that blessing actually benefit me? I don’t think so.\"\nThis was the truth. Though the Garuda had rotted away (literally), it was still a level 9 divine bird. Even till the bitter end, it was suspicious and wary of Lee Shin Woo, so there was a chance those feelings were stored within this artifact. It wouldn’t be much of an issue with Lee Shin Woo’s abilities, but it was still kind of awkward for him.\n\"The best case scenario is if nothing happens to you, but... it’d be a weight off my shoulders if you were to use this skill to survive if you find yourself in danger. So, don’t feel so burdened and just wear it.\"\n\"However...\"\nAs expected, Ye Jin Jin still felt burdened from his request, even though he’d gone so far to assure her. Well, it made sense. To Lee Shin Woo, a revival ability wasn’t really a big deal, but to Ye Jin Jin, it must be. The artifact’s other abilities were quite considerable as well.\nHe supposed it couldn’t be helped. Lee Shin Woo decided to give her some ’extra service’. He beckoned her with his finger and Ye Jin Jin came over to him, albeit confused. Then, he whispered a few words into her ear. It was super effective!\n\"Huah... I-I understand!\"\n\"Good girl.\"\nShortly after, she distanced herself from him. However, her face was flushed beet red as she quietly nodded her head. She had barely accepted the Phoenix’s Feather. Her reaction caused him to smile in satisfaction, and those who had watched their interaction narrowed their eyes. Of course, he didn’t let that bother him at all.\n\"But there’s no way that you can just wear this cheat item. It’s impossible, so long as you don’t possess the level 6 high rank fire element like me. I can temporarily trick the item by using my Wild Card skill, but it won’t last so it won’t work with me alone.\"\n[...Is that where I come in?]\n\"Hoh. You got so smart from just one level up, our little Zenon.\"\nHe hadn’t even called him, but Zenon came forward. Once he’d become a level 8 Shining Salamander, he retained his appearance as a fire lizard. However, his body was a lot smaller than before, as he had shed his skin. He had much smoother curves than before and gave off a sense of elegance. As he thought, the higher level the spirit, the more attractive they became.\n[I can control that artifact. That girl... Ye Jin Jin, right? I can help her use the artifact. Moreover, if I were to help her, Ye Jin Jin will be able to unleash even greater flames, and she won’t have any problems being your representative.]\n\"90 points. You’re just a little bit off.\"\n[I’ll stay by her side and protect her. At the same time, I’ll relay information on the surface to you. And... you’re hoping that I grow with her, right?]\n\"Bingo. 100 points. You’ve just obtained the light element, so you need time to try out your new abilities and grow. If you stay by her side, then you can go wild without people suspecting a thing.\"\nAs expected, forming a contract with a spirit would cause the spirit to adopt some of the contractor’s qualities. Zenon had said exactly what Lee Shin Woo had wanted and went inside of the Phoenix’s Feather. The Phoenix’s Feather, which had unrestrainedly expelled flames everywhere, calmed down and looked like a normal red dress now.\nHe passed the dress over to Ye Jin Jin without hesitation. Ye Jin Jin accepted it with much difficulty and felt the dress over. Then, she carefully voiced her appreciation.\n\"When I look at it up close, it looks quite splendid. It might be difficult to talk to someone wearing this everyday!\"\n\"Who cares? It’s better for a hero to stand out anyway. You’re pretty and have a nice body, so it’ll look nice on you. Don’t worry.\"\n\"Hehehe...\"\nHe added in some compliments here and there, making her feel happy. ’If she met a silver-tongued bastard, then she’d be completely fooled by him...’ he thought. But when he thought about it again, Lee Shin Woo realized he was that silver-tongued bastard.\n\"Ye Jin Jin, Zenon, and Bisher Moon (who’s still in the Empire working); you guys will be responsible for the surface. Rem will support you too. I made sure to check, but the Emperor doesn’t know that I’ve taken control of the golem network. We should be able to acquire information regarding the movements of his forces, the 12 Generals, and his plans. Mostly everything, aside from the Emperor himself.\"\n\"Understood!\"\n[I trust that you haven’t changed your mind. I’ll definitely make a world where all spirits can live in peace.]\nWhat a trustworthy response. Although Ye Jin Jin currently needed the Phoenix’s Feather and Zenon to do much of anything right now, if she were to be ’Lawrence and ’Kay’s representative’, then... the amount of karma and Perium she gained would skyrocket.\nThus, she’d quickly become level 7. She might even reach level 8 before the underground heroes. That’s how far his influence reached!\n\"Mm. I’ll lend you one more thing.\"\nNo matter how offensively capable the Phoenix’s Feather was, it was still a defensive item, so Lee Shin Woo decided to let her borrow a weapon too. It was a javelin created by transforming the level 7 Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatsword!\nIn exchange for its special options, it gained the ability to amplify the fire element when thrown.\n\"This is an amazing item!? Can I really have it?\"\n\"Yeah. You can have this one. If it breaks, I can fix it from afar.\"\nAlthough he had to use one of his 10 Bone Armory slots for it, both his Rule of Bone and Bone Armory skills had grown significantly; even if she were on the surface and he were underground, he could still maintain the weapon for her and even reinforce it.\n\"Wow. Wow...!\"\n[Mm. I should be able to reinforce and withdraw the weapon with my control if it’s a weapon with such powerful flames.]\nIt wasn’t much for Lee Shin Woo, but to Ye Jin Jin, it was an ’unbreakable’ divine spear. And thus, he had successfully created a hero on the spot. The Emperor must be astonished right now!\nHe also wanted to transfer the Evileye General’s Evileye to her, but he couldn’t as of yet. If his Bone Reinforcement advanced a little bit more, and if he studied how to interfere with bone and other matter a bit more, then he should be able to do it, but he couldn’t yet.\n\"And Sinea.\"\n[Y-Yeah? Do I have to stay on the surface too?]\n\"Stay in the Spirits’ Spring for me. We need someone to lead the spirits in the Spirits’ Spring in Zenon’s stead. Since we’ve formed an official contract, you can always call for me, no matter where I am, so don’t feel so lonely...\"\n[Euuu.]\nSinea had stuck to Lee Shin Woo all the time lately as if she thought that being by his side was only natural. Was that why her eyes were brimming with tears?\nBut the Elder Dryad Princess knew full well that she shouldn’t be stubborn. In the end, she nodded her head and said.\n[Make sure you dote on me later.]\n\"You got it.\"\n\"...Dote on her, huh.\"\n\"How do you think he’ll dote on her?\"\nHe ignored the other’s reactions again and Lee Shin Woo ordered to go their separate ways. Ye Jin Jin nodded her head and bought medicine with all the money she’d accumulated thus far. She took all of it at once, wore the Phoenix’s Feather, with Zenon inside, placed the Javelin Lee Shin Woo had created for her on her back and then left.\n\"...Then, shall we get going?\"\n\"In the end, it’s just us two going back.\"\nPleine, who was wondering what the rest would have to say, widened her eyes.\n\"Oh my. Are you really not going to shop for anything? Moreover, the two of you should have some plans moving forward. Are you not going to tell me what they are?\"\n\"I told you. Watch and enjoy.\"\nLee Shin Woo winked at her and activated the Heaven Door’s Key. Lee Shin Woo took out some of the accumulated bones from his inventory and used all the mana he’d saved up to create a gate... Pleine watched on vacantly, but when they took one step into the gate she said to their backs...\n\"You don’t need to feel sorry for me.\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"Since I knew this would happen. I’m actually quite happy that this day came much faster than I’d expected.\"\n\"I appreciate it.\"\nJin tilted his head from beside Lee Shin Woo. Did he not understand yet? It might be for the best if he didn’t understand till the very end.\n\"So you don’t need to avoid me out of guilt. Do you understand? I told you in advance.\"\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\"Thank you. While you’re at it... My stupid little sister might trouble you, but be kind to her for my sake.\"\n\"I’ll think about it.\"\nLee Shin Woo was a stern man. Pleine was pouting, saying that ’he wasn’t a simple skeleton’, but Lee Shin Woo, who was half-way through the gate, turned his head back and asked.\n\"Is my body really not your type?\"\n\"Oh my.\"\nDid he even say that ever since they first met? Pleine narrowed her eyes and replied.\n\"That was a lie. You see, I’m not the type of girl that judges people based on their bodies. You’re flirting with me, aren’t you?\"\n\"I’d always wanted to tell you this.\"\nLee Shin Woo smiled refreshingly and told her his true feelings.\n\"I really wasn’t flirting with you. And your face is pretty, but you’re really not my type. See you later!\"\n\"What...!\"\nLee Shin Woo, who’d successfully carried out his revenge, waved his hand at the shaking Pleine and left the secret shop. For some reason, Jin, who wasn’t even a part of their conversation, was laughing along side of him.",

    "content": "<Chapter 43. Return - 4>\nThe first thing they did after leaving the secret shop was inspecting the wine factory’s facilities. After that, they told the Dryads where their princess was, and what she was doing.\nAfter he’d calmed down the spirits that latched onto him, he collected the wine barrels and supplied new oak barrels. And only then could he sigh.\n\"We’ve finally come to a safe place... so shall we start?\"\n\"...Start what?\"\nJin replied, and gulped down spit he didn’t even have. He tried to feign ignorance, but he already knew what Lee Shin Woo was planning. He could tell just looking at Lee Shin Woo taking out and sorting the 10,000 or so bones he’d collected from the level 8 dungeon!\n\"What do you mean? Before we go, we’re going to level you up.\"\n\"I still need 2,500 stats to level up. Do you really think it’ll be that easy?\"\n\"Yeah. So long as I have this, the Garuda’s Wing Bone!\"\n\"I think so too...\"\nJin saw Lee Shin Woo’s unnecessarily brisk smile (whenever Lee Shin Woo smiled like this, it usually meant that something assuredly not fun was going to happen), and realized that he had no way to escape. Since meeting with Lee Shin Woo this time, Jin’s best friend ’resignation’ had been patting him on the shoulder.\n\"You could say that your level up is the fruit of your time on the surface. I’m sure of it this time. If you absorb the Garuda’s Wing Bone, then... When you level up, you’ll gain real wings!\"\n\"You could make me wings. Can you not make me into a human!?\"\n\"Oh, about that. I hadn’t really explained that part thoroughly enough to you.\"\n\"Ugh...\" Thıs content belongs to novel⁂fire.net\nLee Shin Woo suddenly sobered up. Jin, who had been pushing him, felt tense. Jin thought that maybe Lee Shin Woo could already transform into a complete human.\nHe didn’t get this from Lee Shin Woo’s reaction but from Ye Jin Jin and Sinea’s reactions. ...All the more reason he didn’t want to hear it from him. He was scared of getting a definite answer.\n\"You must have some idea by now, but just a little while ago, I became able to disguise myself completely as a human. No, to be more specific, calling it a disguise at this point doesn’t really fit. It’d be more accurate to say that I can ’define’ myself. It’s because I have this ability that I was able to use the Wild Card or Dark Shadow skills.\"\n\"Ugh...\"\n\"However, that ability’s focused on me. Which means I can’t yet use it to fundamentally change others. Several of my abilities grew as I leveled up, so... I could probably change your outside appearance to that of a human’s, but it’s ultimately limited to just the outside. ...I thought that might hurt you even more, so I didn’t say anything. Sorry.\"\n\"Ugh... Uaaaaah.\"\n\"Jin!?\"\nLee Shin Woo had made up his mind and spoken, but Jin reacted in a completely unexpected way. He expected him to kick with his hind legs or use his Magic Breath, but Jin just rolled onto the ground while screaming.\n\"Eugeuuu! Uaaaaah!\"\nLee Shin Woo was truly taken aback at the sight of Jin rolling on the floor, his four legs writhing. Because Jin’s agility was so high, his feet left afterimages, but laughing would be the worst possible decision here, so he suppressed the feeling.\n\"Heueu. Hoooo...\"\n\"Jin, have you calmed down?\"\n\"Grr.\"\nA few minutes later, Jin stopped writhing around. But when he asked a question, Jin grit his teeth. Seeing that, he realized that Jin hadn’t calmed down yet, so he decided to wait patiently for a few more minutes. Jin skillfully stood up by himself and stepped onto the ground with his four legs.\n\"I’m good.\"\n\"A-Alright.\"\n\"Just wanted to get this out there. You didn’t do anything wrong. I just wanted to vent. Moreover, I know that you’re trying to figure out how to turn me back into a human.\"\n\"Mm...\"\nIf he were to say ’You knew about that already?’, then their partnership might break. Lee Shin Woo looked into his eyes and Jin sighed. Then, Jin spoke much softer than before.\n\"You said you could change my outer appearance, right?\"\n\"Yeah. To whatever appearance you recognize.\"\n\"Alright. Then could you turn me back, before I level up, just once? I want to show you what I looked like when I was still human.\"\n...It was a long time coming. At least, that’s what Lee Shin Woo thought. When Jin said that, the hanging tension between them had already implied the coming results.\nEven so, he couldn’t not do it. This was an event of sorts. An event that had to occur if Lee Shin Woo and Jin wanted to continue to be partners from now on. In the end, Lee Shin Woo nodded his head.\n\"...Alright.\"\n\"I’m all set.\"\nLee Shin Woo slowly extended his hand towards Jin and used his Disguise skill. The change was immediate. The horse shape turned into a human’s build, and in the middle of it, skin began to cover Jin’s body.\nIf Lee Shin Woo were disguising himself, it wouldn’t take this long. But because he was using it on someone else, so dramatically at that, the process was a bit horrifying. The basic modeling was finished, which set the groundwork for adjusting the fine lines of the human body; it was starting to look like a human now.\n\"...Hoo.\"\nJin’s image was indispensable, as he was transforming from a skeleton horse to a human. Not a weak image, like something he’d seen just once or twice, but his own image, the image of himself all his life.\nTherefore, there could be only one viable result: Jin Taylor’s human appearance on Earth.\n\"It really is my body.\"\nShe was finished disguising. Jin’s voice was always quite beautiful, but it had become even more so when she’d transformed into a human. It was the type of voice that made someone feel better just by listening to it.\n\"...That so?\"\n\"Yep.\"\nJin’s legs were slender as if it was evidence that she was a sprinter, and the beauty of her leg lines, which started at her muscled thighs, was truly striking. The hot pants really fit her.\nHer upper body was thin as well. Jin’s loose-fitting T-shirt didn’t cover fully cover her slender waist. It was the same for her slender stomach. But her chest was so voluptuous that he wondered whether she could really run with it. Jin saw where he was looking and smiled as if she found it funny. Then, she explained.\n\"Shin Woo, you shouldn’t underestimate the recent sports bras.\"\n\"What’s worse, it even disguised what you’re wearing as well... Never mind.\"\nHe’d only transformed her outer appearance, but he’d almost responded unnecessarily. It was definitely because he was agitated. Lee Shin Woo then asked her.\n\"So how do you feel?\"\n\"Mm.\"\nLee Shin Woo looked into her eyes (as she was laughing) and smiled bitterly. Her blond ponytailed hair was quite striking, but her endlessly blue eyes and her facial features were so beautiful that he felt like it was a bit of a waste that she was an athlete.\n’When she was still an athlete, she must’ve had a ton of fans’, he thought calmly... and then he bowed his head and apologized to her.\n\"I’m sorry for everything till now. I’m a real bastard.\"\nThat’s right. He’d desperately ignored it until now, but he’d already known for a while.\nThat Jin was a girl.\nThere was no way he couldn’t know.\n’Our countries were different, the way we lived were different... We had too many different fundamental values that couldn’t be attributed to just those two factors.’\nNo, that was just an excuse. He’d known from the beginning. He was suspicious when he’d first heard Jin’s voice, and he was sure of it when he saw how well she got along with Ye Jin Jin.\nHe had been a company employee in South Korea. There was no way that Lee Shin Woo, who’d met so many people during his time as a company employee, wouldn’t recognize his partner’s gender, who he spent 24 hours a day with. But the reason he’d regarded Jin as a man was because ’it was more comfortable for him that way’.\nJin knew that, and he trusted that Jin understood.\n\"You don’t need to apologize. At first, I thought it’d be better if I kept it ambiguous. Even if I’m a skeleton horse, it’d be tough to ride on top a girl’s back, right?\"\n\"No... I’m so sorry.\"\n\"Moreover, look. We’re a skeleton and skeleton horse. Who cares about gender? What was the point in even distinguishing my gender?\"\n\"I’m sorry.\"\nLee Shin Woo had thought that way, so he’d left it alone, but you never know how someone might react. They really should’ve tackled this issue from the beginning. That’s why Lee Shin Woo was apologizing.\n\"The more you apologize, the more miserable I feel... Haha.\"\nThe reason why trivial issues like this had become such a big deal, despite them being a skeleton and a skeleton horse was because... well, it was kind of obvious. Could he really write it off by saying that their timing was off or their mental attitude wasn’t good?\nIt was fine when Jin was still a skeleton horse since her feelings wouldn’t show on her face, but now, he could see her bitter expression on her face. So no matter how shameless Lee Shin Woo was, he felt like something was stabbing him in the heart.\n\"I guess there’s some hope for me yet if you’re feeling so apologetic. Though it’s kind of laughable for me, a skeleton horse, to be saying stuff like this.\"\n\"I should be able to turn you back into a human soon.\"\n\"Alright. I trust you. When the time comes, we can start there. ...We’ll be able to start from there, right?\"\nJin’s specialty was acting weak and unconfident, despite her exceptional abilities. Even after she assumed her beautiful human form, she remained the same, so he smiled automatically. She was well aware that her outer appearance was just a secondary factor to their relationship.\n\"Yeah, of course.\"\n\"Alright. I trust you, so I’ll go back to being a horse. I’ll level up as fast as I can.\"\n\"Ok.\"\nLee Shin Woo used all the elite level 8 bones, as well as the Garuda’s Wing Bone on Jin, and Jin finally leveled up. In the process, she’d gained actual wings! Though they were comprised of bone, she wouldn’t need to use the ’jet engines’ all across her body anymore to stabilize herself in the air. Steel Heart formed over the bone wings, and by shooting out mana from that section alone, Jin would be able to fly.\nAnd there was one more trivial change as well.\nThe moment he’d used the Garuda’s Wing Bone for Bone Reinforcement, both Lee Shin Woo and Jin gained the light element.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 43 part5",
    "content": "<Chapter 43. Return - 5>\n[You have learned the Lv1 High Rank Light element. Magic has increased by 100.]\n[Light is one of the two great elements that govern the world. It is the power that signals the beginning, accelerates the growth and development of all creation, and is the power that allows you to reach an unreachable domain. Light dispels the darkness and possesses the power of severing relationships.]\n[It is incredibly difficult to grasp the nature of the light element, and is not an element easily wielded. This power, which can be acquired only by severing everything, is often referred to as divine power by priests. As true divinity is something only gods can wield, the light element is not true divinity.]\n\"Ah, so this is how I get the light element, huh.\"\nLee Shin Woo perused the message a few times and was deeply moved. He hadn’t shown any signs, but he’d been trying very hard to obtain the light element.\nHe’d used his Bone Winged Serpent staff to reverse darkness into light, studied his Light Resistance, recollected Seira Von Retadane’s powerful light and had tried to copy the mana pattern she’d used, to no avail. To put it bluntly, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that he’d dumped all his free time into acquiring the light element.\n\"The fact that I did all that, but still didn’t get it must mean that I don’t have much affinity with the light element.\"\nThat was only natural. The Light element wasn’t normally obtainable by the undead, so it made sense that his compatibility with the element was at an all time low. Lee Shin Woo wasn’t aware of this, but whenever the Garuda used the light element or its Shining Flame, which was mixed with the light element, it took damage, as it had degenerated into an undead.\nRegardless, the Garuda was able to wield the high rank light element with ease, and as a result of absorbing its bone (he still had his share, the Garuda’s Sphenoid Bone, but in the process of reinforcing Jin with the Wing Bone, the Sphenoid Bone had awakened as well), he was able to acquire the High Rank Light element as well.\nIf God hadn’t bestowed him with Light Resistance, then even Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t have been able to obtain the light element. Jin was in the same boat.\n’Dark Flame is nice and all, but Bone Reinforcement’s the best for permanent growth.’\nRather than researching the element by himself, it was a far more effective approach to absorb a divine bird’s bone, which could wield the light element at an already high level.\nOf course, he kept in mind that there was a chance that he wouldn’t obtain the light element from Bone Reinforcement either, but he got lucky. Since he’d been yearning for the light element ever since he’d acquired the darkness element, he felt like he’d just completed a high rank quest.\n’It makes sense that I got the element, but it’s really surprising that Jin did as well. It might’ve been the best time for her to level up. If not, maybe my Joker karma affected her?’\nNormally, humans (all of mankind, excluding monsters) couldn’t wield the elements themselves. Even if they could, it would be the result of processing natural mana, or through a special skill or spell. Which meant that they would have to go one step higher from the middle. However, Jin had acquired the light element regardless!\nThere were several reasons as to why she did. Lee Shin Woo’s Joker karma could’ve affected her, or perhaps Jin gained a deeper understanding of magic and her limits were released as she leveled up. If not, then perhaps Jin was considered a monster, rather than a human being now.\nHe had one more idea, but if he said it, Jin would definitely hit him, so he just thought about it. Since Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t be able to look at Jin for a while!\n’Now that I think about it, the Emperor used a high rank element with ease. Maybe the difference between man and monster becomes meaningless when one passes level 8.’\nWhen he had reached level 8, Lee Shin Woo had reached the peak of the darkness element. And because of his innate skills, he could ’define’ himself however he wished, so it felt like he was right.\nHe accepted it and nodded his head. Lee Shin Woo looked at Jin, who was flying with her steel-covered wings and tried using his light element again. It had been so hard getting it, yet once he did, it was so simple to use.\nBut he could already control cause and effect through his Shining Flame and other innate skills, so Lee Shin Woo didn’t feel that the light element, which ’severed relationships’, was very appealing to him.\n\"Though I suppose it’s useful in healing, growth and development, or attacking at an incredibly fast speed.\"\nLee Shin Woo glimpsed to the side again. Jin, who’d become accustomed to flying with only her wings, used light mana as an auxiliary propulsion system... she was trying to fly even faster with those ’boosters’ of hers and managed to top her previous max speed.\nShe wasn’t able to control her speed 100%, so she collided with objects here and there. He decided to ignore the fact that her doing so was causing the underground cave to reach its limit.\n\"Uaaaaah! It’s too fasssssst!\"\n\"Sorry, Jin. I can’t understand you at all.\"\nBefitting the skill God had bestowed upon her, Jin had truly become a Child of Light. She could reach light speed now! He was so jealous! But it wasn’t in his character to just stay jealous.\n\"Yeah. There should be several innate elements that are derived from the light element.\"\nAfter all, Lee Shin Woo possessed the Beginner Shining Flame already. Of course, this was created from the divine bird’s karma, so Lee Shin Woo could only advance it to the intermediate level.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo knew that there had to be a high rank derivative of the light element or even a fusion innate element. The message that described the light element had been extremely suspicious. It would allow him to reach an unreachable domain... This must not be referring to learning the light element itself, but what lays beyond it!\n’Now that I think about it, when I was first affected by the light element, my Holy Resistance reacted, resulting in the creation of Light Resistance. Which means...’\nPerhaps the holy element was an innate element that was derived from the light element...? No, it might even be a fusion element with the darkness element. With that in mind, Lee Shin Woo felt his heart pound (he was still in his human form).\nBut he couldn’t try it out right now. Just because he knew that he could combine the two elements and create an innate element didn’t mean that he could just be like ’how about I give it a go?’ and combine them so easily.\nInnate elements required, above all, karma that suited them. The resulting change in the element would follow. So, Lee Shin Woo was merely at the starting line now.\n\"If for no other reason...\"\nLee Shin Woo raised the remaining sphenoid bone. It was fine if he didn’t get much from it. If the Shining Flame was reinforced, then... that would be fine.\n[Absorbing the Lv9 Garuda’s Sphenoid Bone. Strength and Health have increased by 130, Agility by 200, and Magic by 250. The High Rank Light element has become Lv4 and Magic has increased by 60. The Beginner Shining Flame element has become Lv5 and Magic has increased by 20. The Soul Seeing Eyes skill has become Lv5 and all stats have increased by 10. The Mana Acceleration and Mana Bone skills have become Lv8, and Magic has increased by 40. You have learned the special passive skill, Manatization. Health and Magic has increased by 20.]\n...He thought, but he gained something else entirely. Manatization. Lee Shin Woo had a feeling as to what it was when he obtained the skill.\nWhen he thought back to the Garuda’s body, he knew the answer. It had made half its body into mana. That ability had become a skill.\n’A level 9 indeed. An unimaginable skill just pops up out of nowhere.’\nLee Shin Woo closed his eyes and thought. He was already somewhat capable of turning his body into mana. As a result of reaching the peak of the darkness element, he could temporarily turn his body into darkness.\nHowever, this skill, Manatization, was similar but also fundamentally different.\n’This skill is... permanent.’\nThe Garuda was almost half spirit. It had attempted to transcend the limitations of its physical body and soul by turning its body into mana.\nIn lieu of that though, the Manatization skill would transform his body into mana. To be more specific, it would replace all his stats: Strength, Agility, and Health, etc. with Magic.\nCould he call it artificially becoming a spirit? Was it a natural development for him... No, he supposed it was only one of the many possibilities of maximum growth for one who understands the principle behind magic. Official source ıs Nov3lFɪre.ɴet\n’But this skill... There are a lot of things I’m concerned about.’\nOf course, turning his body into mana wasn’t without its weaknesses. The spirits’ physical strength wasn’t very good.\nThere was no going back once he decided to change his body into mana, and training the Manatization skill meant that he would be picking one of the two roads in front of him, without the ability to go back.\n...For everyone besides Lee Shin Woo that is.\n\"I gained quite the ability here.\"\nCold sweat trailed down his back. He could already ’define’ his existence however he wished, and change it whenever he needed to!\nIn other words, even if he trains the Manatization skill and changes all his body into mana, he could immediately change his body back whenever he wanted! To be blunter, he, who had focused most of his stats in Magic, had become able to redistribute his stats at will!\n\"...Training Manatization might be better thantraining to get the holy element.\"\nEven he thought this was a cheat skill. Combining his ability as a Joker and the Manatization skill was far too dangerous!\nBut that’s precisely why he was drawn to it. If Lee Shin Woo switched between his mana body (in other words, an evil spirit) and his physical body, then he could respond with the appropriate form during battle. Perhaps that was, in its own way, a ’perfect form’...\n\"Moreover, maybe I can solve my skill issue with this.\"\nChanging his body into mana meant that he would be changing his bones into mana as well.\nIf he could cause a fundamental change in his bones by training his Manatization, then wouldn’t it fundamentally change his Bone Reinforcement, Rule of Bone, and Bone Armory? Perhaps he could raise them to an even higher level!\nThis was only speculation for now, but Lee Shin Woo realized that his Manatization was the key to evolving his skills. if he were to train this skill, which changed everything he was into mana, then he would ultimately transcend matter and magic!\n\"Lord Garuda, thank you so much. If I get to level 10, then it’s all because of you!\"\nLee Shin Woo genuinely thanked the dead Garuda. If it knew, it would probably be really pissed, but fortunately, there weren’t any problems on that front, since its soul had been burnt away as well.",

    "content": "<Chapter 43. Return - 6>\nHe still had two pieces of loot left. One of them was the level 8 Sun Fossil, [1] which he’d made before by using the Shard of the Sun Temple’s Central Pillar.\nLee Shin Woo wondered what he should do with this but ultimately used it on his Titan Core. Not only did the recharge time reduce by 2 weeks, but its growth (due to the Garuda’s power) was accelerated as well.\nHe touched it in satisfaction and turned his attention to the final piece of loot. This was the biggest issue here. It was just too good of an item.\n[Death God’s Shining Bone Sword (+3)]\n[Lv8]\n[Durability: 5,000/5,000]\n[Attack Power: 2,500 - 2,750]\n[Element: Light Lv8]\n[Options: Strength +150, Magic +100, and when you attack, you sever your enemy’s link between their Health and Magic]\n[Special passive skill: Smile of the Death God - When you are attacked or attack during battle, there is a high chance that the Shining Bone Sword will duplicate, which will automatically attack your foe. Once the duplicated Shining Bone Sword strikes, it disappears.]\n[Special active skill: Fury of the Death God - This ability can only be used by accumulating a large quantity of mana within the sword. Unleashes a slash at every foe within your sight, and severs all spatial and magical interference.]\nOne might think that Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t feel enthusiastic about the weapon, as he’d given the Phoenix’s Feather to Ye Jin Jin just a little while ago, but this was actually the first time he’d ever gotten a level 8 weapon!\nAs evidence of this, its attack power was ridiculously high, even when factoring in its evolution and the +3 tag. Plus, its max attack power was about 250 higher than his previous most powerful weapon, the level 7 Giant Drake Horn Lance.\nWhen he took into account the fact that the Death God’s Shining Bone Sword could be wielded with one hand, while the Giant Drake Horn Lance required two and could only be used when charging, Lee Shin Woo could tell just how high-class this weapon was.\n\"If I fought the Emperor with this in hand, wouldn’t I just win...?\"\nLee Shin Woo briefly deluded himself, but soon shook his head. He wasn’t sure about the Undead Emperor, but the Magic Emperor was no pushover.\nHe could die if he was conceited. Even though he had 154 extra lives, it wouldn’t change the gravity of death.\n’Let’s stop thinking about such pointless stuff and... absorb this.’\nHis Bone Armory skill was now level 10. His weapons and armor were reinforced within his Bone Armory, as the equipments’ info was shared with each other. In other words, if he were to absorb the Death God’s Shining Bone Sword, then all of his stored equipment would be reinforced instantaneously!\nIt was less burdensome to absorb equipment than bones, but absorbing such a high level weapon should take a lot out of him. Once he had prepared himself, he gripped the sword and absorbed it.\n[Storing the Death God’s Shining Bone Sword in the Bone Armory. Strength has increased by 150 and Magic by 100. The Bone Armory skill has become Lv11, and Health and Magic have increased by 20. You can now summon and maintain twenty pieces of equipment at a time. All equipment stored within the Bone Armory have been reinforced.]\n[You can now summon the Lv7 Dead Bone Full Armor.]\n\"!?\"\nLee Shin Woo had expected his Bone Armory to level up once he absorbed the Death God’s Shining Bone Sword. Since this was his first time absorbing a level 8 artifact. But he didn’t think his Bone Armory’s summoning limit would double!\nWhen Bone Armory reached level 10, the skill had become much stronger, but Lee Shin Woo was shocked, as he didn’t think one more level would make this much of a difference. By becoming level 8, Lee Shin Woo could use more mana at one time and could even draw in ambient mana, so this could be seen as his Bone Armory becoming two times as effective!\nNot only that, his armor set had been upgraded to level 7 as well. He had nothing else to ask for. Lee Shin Woo felt as though his Bone Armory skill was almost ’perfect’ and shook.\n\"With this... Maybe I really should hold a ceremony for the Garuda... More importantly, are there no half-rotten mythological creatures in the Underground Empire?\"\n\"You’re terrible.\"\nJin, who’d returned after becoming somewhat familiar with her new body and the light element, looked at Lee Shin Woo unkindly.\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo didn’t pay her any mind and immediately swapped his armor. After that, he resummoned his Prayer of the Dead (the cape), which had become slightly stronger both in terms of its defense and subsequent properties. If he included Ye Jin Jin’s javelin, then he had three slots used up right now.\n\"Alright. Then to fill up the other seventeen slots...\"\nHe summoned two Giant Drake Horn Lances, two Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatswords, two Light God’s Fury, and two copies of the Titan’s Fortress. After that, he summoned nine Death God’s Shining Bone Swords and attached one of them to his waist.\nLee Shin Woo’s mana had bottomed out, as he had used so much at once, but by using his Mana Acceleration and Mana Bone skills, his mana was quickly replenished. Lee Shin Woo dominated the mana around him, which somewhat resembled the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin.\n\"It would be a sight to see, shooting all the fully charged Death God’s Shining Bone Swords.\"\n\"The fact that these weapons are going to be following us around everywhere is terrifying...\"\nOf course, charging level 7 and level 8 weapons was still an arduous task for Lee Shin Woo, but it would also be good mana practice for him. It would be his warm-up for his training in Manatization.\n\"Then, there’s nothing else to do here, right? Jin, let’s go inspect the troops.\"\n\"Inspecting the troops... What exactly do you mean by that?\"\n\"Moving a mountain with one finger, or making a tunnel, or setting up a barracks... You know, stuff like that.\"\n\"How are you going to move a mountain...? With a beam...?\"\nLee Shin Woo climbed atop Jin, whose speed was incomparable to before (they both felt a bit awkward) and left the wine factory. They then went to one of the large cities (in the level 3 danger zone), where the Heaven Defying General’s troops were divided and stationed, went down into the sewers, and checked on the condition of his troops.\nWhile he was on the surface, he had given his appointed commanders (the Giants’ commanders were Ellata and Arogan, the Chimeras’ commander was Chi Paul, and finally, the Avenger, Shino Rendu was the Paul Corps’) orders to move around his troops in rotations. As they were undead, which didn’t tire, there were a large number of bones gathered from each squad.\n[Lord Paul Zero, it seems like you’ve become even stronger!]\n[That’s not all. The power he’s conveying is even stronger than before. The Titan has become even stronger!]\n[Ooooh. As expected of the Titan’s second coming...!]\n[Look at me. I’ve received the Titan’s energy and can now wield flames!]\n\"You guys are no pushovers. I’ll make you even stronger, so bring me all the bones you’ve collected.\"\nThe Giants were first. The conspicuously large Giants were forced to move carefully, killing everything in the area and then returning to hide within the sewers. Even so, they had collected the largest amount of bones amongst the squads. He used most of them to reinforce the Giants but kept the garbage bones to himself. Lee Shin Woo could always use them to either fuel the Heaven Door’s Key or heal himself.\nNot only were they strengthened by Bone Reinforcement, but the reinforced Titan Core had strengthened the entire tribe once more. The Giants saw him off and Lee Shin Woo moved on to the next group.\n[Lord Paul Zero. I’m glad you’ve come back safely!]\n\"Yeah, I’m glad you’re safe too. You’ve become a lot stronger, huh.\"\nNext up was Shino Rendu’s squad, which consisted of the quickest of the Pauls. This squad was best suited for investigation or infiltration. They had found a hidden level 5 dungeon and had brought back a large number of elite bones.\n[I’d like to become level 8 as soon as possible too...!]\n\"Don’t be impatient. If you do your best, then you’ll reach level 8 eventually.\"\nShino Rendu, who thirsted for revenge, had inherited Metafel Rerdan’s essence, and could thus develop his stats and skills separately without achieving a feat, using Bone Reinforcement, or leveling up his skills, by eating any monsters, including the undead.\nHow much must he have eaten for him to possess an intermediate level 7’s stats? Moreover, Lee Shin Woo had used only the elite bones to reinforce him, yet Shino hadn’t had his fill. It seemed like he was excited by Lee Shin Woo’s level up.\n\"What about the 12 Generals’ movements?\"\n[Nothing much changed after my last report. But... we met the Fire Slayer Sword God on our way back from a hunt.]\n\"The Fire Slayer Sword God?\"\nSince coming to the Underground Empire, he’d met several people with extremely chunni titles before, but this was the first time he’d ever heard something as ridiculous as the Fire Slayer Sword God. Lee Shin Woo tilted his head and Shino Rendu added.\n[He was definitely Seagald Von Retadane.]\n\"...Ah.\"\nAs he thought. Seagald was one of the 12 Generals, so that must’ve been the title he received from the Emperor. But he still had his doubts. It was way too much to give one of the 12 Generals a title like that. The Fire Slayer Sword God? Would the Emperor really give one of his men the title of ’God’?\nLee Shin Woo felt like he’d need to look into this further. But there was something more important than that to be done...\n\"So what happened? The fact that you’re here means that he didn’t kill you.\"\n[He asked us to join his troops, but I refused, saying that I already followed someone else. I was prepared to die, but surprisingly, he just let us go. I felt like he wasn’t our enemy, for now at least.]\n\"...Yeah. As long as you came back alive, it’s fine.\"\nWhen faced with an unbeatable foe, Lee Shin Woo’s policy was to trick them and get out of there alive, but... It would’ve been better had he gotten a spy to infiltrate Seagald’s ranks. They had all survived though, so that was good enough.\nLee Shin Woo tapped Shino Rendu’s shoulder, who looked like he was saying ’I stayed loyal to you until the very end, Lord Paul Zero!’. It seems like he’s gotten smarter than before, but... perhaps this was as far as his intellect would go.\n[We exist for Lord Paul Zero!]\n[Uooooh! It’s not Seagald who walks the righteous path, but Lord Paul Zero!]\n[Glory to Lord Paul Zero!]\nMoreover, Shino’s Pauls were saying that they’d follow Lee Shin Woo instead of General Seagald till the very end. They didn’t even give Lee Shin Woo an opportunity to retort. Lee Shin Woo looked tepidly at Shino and asked.\n\"Did you hear anything out of the ordinary from him?’\n[He said that he could probably cooperate with you, Lord Paul Zero. He said that our enemies are the same.]\n\"Enemies, huh...\"\nHe felt like he’d heard that somewhere before. Now that he thought about it, it was the same thing that he, as the Heaven Defying General, had told the other heroes. He moaned automatically.\nIn any case, so long as Seagald was aware of the Heaven Defying General, he would have an opportunity to meet with him in the not too distant future. Since Seagald’s power was an unknown, he would have to approach him carefully. Latest content publıshed on novel•ﬁre.net\n\"Alright. I may need your power soon, so rest up for now.\"\n[I understand!]\nCompared to the other squads, the golem squad had sustained more casualties, as they followed their master’s orders to the letter. However, they were also easier to restore back to full strength, as they had brought back the cores.\nOnce he’d finished reinforcing the golems, he approached the Chimera squad. They had been using the underground waterworks of a city that bordered the level 4 danger zone as their base camp, and because their revenge was mostly focused on Arema Steelworker and the Emperor, they had been the most active. They also had some information they needed to share with him.\n[Arema Steelworker is on the move. He is heading towards the city in the level 4 danger zone... Bayran.]\n[1] T/N: I assume that this Sun Fossil and the Hands that Cover the Sun are equivalent.",

    "content": "<Chapter 44. Bayran Infiltration - 1>\n\"Bayran.\"\nBayran was located in the level 4 danger zone and was an extremely large city, which led directly to the capital. He knew he needed to go there eventually. But to think that Arema Steelworker was going over there... This was obviously no coincidence.\n\"Arema Steelworker, huh.\"\n[That’s correct. You already knew that their movements were unusual following our last great battle. We’ve also seen the Emperor’s forces and the Anti-Skull fight in a few small skirmishes, but...]\n\"Did they make any suspicious moves after that?\"\n[Yes. Arema Steelworker and some golems, which emitted a strong energy, appeared where you said they would, and we’ve confirmed that they’re moving in a particular direction. It’s the route to Bayran.]\n\"...As I thought. Good work. It’s important info. But you mentioned that their movements weren’t particularly hidden?\"\n[Yes. ...They moved so conspicuously that I suspect it was on purpose. Please take that into consideration.]\nHe could trust in the Chimeras’ and their hostility towards Arema Steelworker, but something smelled off with their info...\nWhy was Arema Steelworker acting now, when he had been so quiet thus far? According to the information he’d procured on the surface, Arema Steelworker wasn’t the type to take risks against the Undead Emperor. Moreover, he’s showing himself and going to Bayran? That was way too suspicious.\n’That guy’s objective might be the heroes instead.’\nEverything was progressing as the Magic Emperor wished. However, all of the heroes were currently underground and attempting to overthrow the Undead Emperor. A few of the 12 Generals had been killed, and killing the Undead Emperor had become an actual possibility. Perhaps Arema Steelworker was wary of the heroes interrupting his plan.\nIf not, then perhaps he was trying to eliminate them in case they posed a threat to the surface... No, that was unlikely. Since Arema Steelworker should have in-depth knowledge regarding the underground barrier.\n’If it’s none of those options, then there’s only one possibility left... He may be trying to kill the Heaven Defying General.’\nPaul Zero, or the Heaven Defying General was considered the ’hottest potato’ underground. They didn’t know where the Heaven Defying General would pop up and he was bizarre, as he acted outside the scope of normal undead behavior. No one could tell whether the Heaven Defying General was really an undead or not.\n...Thus, there was a high likelihood of Arema Steelworker being wary of him. Arema Steelworker’s conspicuous movements must be to draw the Heaven Defying General to Bayran and annihilate his forces.\n’Let’s assume this information has been leaked to the other heroes... He may be trying to get the Heaven Defying General and the heroes to meet.’\nLee Shin Woo quickly organized his thoughts. And then, he smiled bitterly at the Chi Pauls, who were awaiting his orders, and said.\n\"I’m going to Bayran. I have another mission for you.\"\n[But my lord!] ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ novel⟡fire.net\n\"It’s a trap, I know. He’s probably trying to get us, the imperial troops, and the heroes to fight against each other. Going with a large force is a bad idea.\"\n[That’s true, but my lord, I’m concerned for your safety!]\nThey claimed they were concerned for his safety, but they couldn’t hide their thirst for vengeance that dwelled within their blazing goblin fire. If anyone other than their master, Lee Shin Woo, had ordered them not to go, then they might have fought back. Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and explained.\n\"If I bring you all with me, then they’ll know I’m the Heaven Defying General. Also, you don’t have to be concerned for my safety. Even if he attacks me with all four of the Four Heavenly Commanders, I can win all by myself. Of course, he could have something hidden up his sleeve, but the moment we face off head-to-head, he’ll be no match for me. I’m sure of it. You see, I have a secret weapon of my own.\"\n[A weapon...?]\nThat’s right. Once he’d ascertained Arema Steelworker’s true identity, he’d given Bisher Moon a single order through Rem.\nBisher Moon had fulfilled his duty and gotten Lee Shin Woo what he’d wanted. Fortunately, Bisher had passed it on to him before Lee Shin Woo had to leave the surface. So long as he had ’that’, there was no chance that he’d lose to Arema Steelworker.\n’Though I wasn’t able to create a new seal that surpassed Arema Steelworker’s...’\nThe end justifies the means. What’s important was that Arema Steelworker’s golem army posed absolutely no threat to Lee Shin Woo. Lee Shin Woo didn’t even consider him a target anymore. He was worried about the other 12 Generals interfering, especially...\n’Seagald Von Retadane...’\nOne of the 12 Generals, who possessed the title of Fire Slayer Sword God. He was part of the Four Heavenly Commanders. The undead who commanded the organization, Anti-Skull.\nHow would he, who researched till the bitter end so that his people didn’t turn into the undead, have turned out? Would he be deluded, just like the Undead Emperor? If not, then would he be independent and free-willed like Lee Shin Woo?\n’Perhaps my greatest foe will be him...’\nWould Seagald have missed Arema Steelworker’s movements? Unlikely. He’d even encountered Lee Shin Woo’s troops, who had moved as secretly as possible. They had been quiet until now, but if they decided to act in earnest, then their mobility and information gathering wouldn’t lose to any of the other factions.\n\"I suppose I won’t know anything for sure until I meet him in person.\"\n\"Meet who?\"\n\"Anyone. This might be as big of a mess as the one on the surface.\"\n\"You’re the one who’s going to make the mess, Shin Woo. Just like what you’ve done up till now.\"\n\"I’m just preparing myself thoroughly.\"\nPrepare yourself for the worst, ready yourself for every variable, and then make your move. This line of thinking had become even better ever since he’d gained the Wild Card skill. If Jin could read his mind, then she’d say ’so in the other words, you’re going to make a mess of things from now on too.’ and despair, but fortunately, she didn’t possess a mind reading skill.\n’I wanted to go only after I’d gathered a few more maps.’\nHe possessed three Bayran Inner Maps. These maps were dropped by the 12 Generals. Unfortunately, each of the three maps’ contents were different.\nIf he had two more maps, or even just one more, then he would be able to compare the differences among them and create a singular map, but... It couldn’t be helped. He didn’t have any more. Lee Shin Woo had no other choice but to arrive on site and rely on his Wild Card skill!\n\"Hoo... Mm?\"\n[Lord Paul Zero...!]\n\"Good grief.\"\nLee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and sighed. However, Chi Paul was looking straight at him. His gaze was so intense that it felt like lasers would shoot out of them.\n\"...Fine. Let’s go. You have to try and get your revenge, don’t you.\"\n[Really!?]\nTheir very essence was made up of vengeance. He couldn’t stop them from coming, especially when they wanted to meet the target of their revenge so badly.\nAbove all, Lee Shin Woo felt slightly guilty towards all of his undead subordinates. He thought that if his subordinates had free-will, then he’d respect it. However, that had turned out to be a lie.\n\"I’m going to pretend to be a human. I told you before, but we can’t go together. So we’ll space ourselves out, exchange opinions from afar, and then act.\"\n[Understood!]\nChi Paul was a level 7 elite. Ever since he had been in Lee Shin Woo’s service, he had been a level 7 elite. However, he had grown immensely, and through this recent round of Bone Reinforcement, his stats were almost at 9,000.\nMoreover, four of the other Chi Pauls had gotten to level 7 through their recent reinforcement, so they were more than enough to take on one of the 12 Generals. If he used them well, then they would definitely be a lot of help to him.\n’It’s nice to be back underground. After all, I can call guys like this without hesitation.’\nNow that he thought about it, Lee Shin Woo’s actions on the surface had been a ’one-man show’. Even his most trustworthy ally, the Pope, hadn’t stepped foot onto the battlefield and was the type to show his true worth when dealing with other people.\nLee Shin Woo wondered how Ye Jin Jin was doing on the surface, but soon grinned and organized his thoughts.\n\"Then, get ready to leave. I’ll do a final check over the data.\"\n[Yes sir!]\nWas there really any need to look over the data? Lee Shin Woo wanted to pay his respects to his seniors before the battle, and it was also meant to act as a pick-off throw. He then accessed the chatting channel.\n[Lee Shin Woo: Seniors, have you all been well?]\n[Lloyd H.K.: I feel like I’m going to die.]\n[Erian Ruparte: I feel for you. We just got out of a dungeon. You have good timing, Lee Shin Woo.]\nThe first person to greet him was Lloyd. He’d gone through a lot, but Lee Shin Woo could say that Lloyd was, without question, the most hero-like of the heroes. After his duel with Lee Shin Woo, Lloyd had matured mentally a little bit, and had become a hero that would really suit a comic book.\n[Lee Shin Woo: I’m glad you’re alright. I just cleared a dungeon myself. It’s nice that there are so many dungeons in the level 4 danger zone.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: But there’s danger lurking everywhere. You never know when you’ll meet one of the 12 Generals.]\n[Prince Altania: I agree 100%.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: ...Senior Prince, there’s no reason to deliberately follow Kratia’s speech pattern, is there?]\n[Prince Altania: I’m not. It’s just that, hanging out with her for so long has made me talk a lot less!]\nShe didn’t seem to talk any less than before, but he just grinned and went with the flow.\nHe felt at peace somewhere in his heart, as he was able to talk with his comrades after such a long time. It was a relationship filled with lies and deceit, but he felt warmth from the relationship regardless. Perhaps this was proof that he was changing.\n[Erian Rupate: I was concerned since you hadn’t kept in contact for so long. Though I know that you’re the type of person who works well alone.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: I apologize. I knew I needed to get a lot stronger, so... I was completely absorbed in my endeavors.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: It’s fine, since you’re ok. ...You see, I have high expectations for you. I was able to grow because of you, so I hope you always stay as you are... Why am I suddenly saying something so embarrassing!?]\n[Prince Altania: So you can feel embarrassment, huh. You really have grown.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Prince, you...!]\nWill there come a day where he tells them the truth? If not, then would it be better if he never told some of them, since he can assume a perfect human form...\nHe briefly pondered on the multiple scenarios that popped up in his head and just grinned. Lee Shin Woo realized that he considered the other heroes as comrades, or allies. Back then (when he had first come to the Underground Empire), he would’ve held his stomach in laughter.\nOf course, this had only become possible because he had become so strong than none of them could pose a threat to him.\n’But still, allies huh...’\nIt wasn’t a bad feeling. That was even more surprising, but Lee Shin Woo decided to accept that newfound feeling. Perhaps this was natural growth that came about due to his level up.\n[Prince Altania: In any case, Kratia suggested that we meet up. You must have it rough being alone, Junior, so I’ll come personally to...]\n[Lee Shin Woo: I’m going to Bayran right now. It’s a large city within the level 4 danger zone. Is there anyone currently in that area?]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Bayran...]\n[Prince Altania: Eut. That’s...]\nThey muttered, but none of the other heroes said yes. It was exactly as he’d expected. It would be dangerous anyway, as there was a chance that the other 12 Generals, or undead forces would be there, so he was just going to warn them that they shouldn’t approach.\n[Lee Shin Woo: Yes, it’s dangerous. And it’ll get even more dangerous from here on out. I recommend that you do not approach Bayran unless I ask you for help. You too, Senior Prince.]\nThat’s right. This was his way of keeping his seniors out of danger, but...\n[Seira Von Retadane: I’m already on my way there. ...What a coincidence, Lee Shin Woo. Would you like to meet up?]\n\"...Huh?\"\nA coincidence? He was pretty sure he should be the one saying that.\nThe person he’d least wanted to associate himself with had taken the bait.",

    "content": "<Chapter 44. Bayran Infiltration - 2>\n[Seira Von Retadane: I felt uneasy going alone, but I’d feel a lot better going with someone as talented as you. Let’s meet in front of the city.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: Oh, uh... that’s...]\n[Seira Von Retadane: Then let’s do that. I’ll send you a private chat request when I get close.]\n[Ms. Seira Von Retadane has left the chat.]\nRetadane had one-sidedly left the chat without giving Lee Shin Woo the chance to retort. He was dumbfounded by the unexpected turn of events and remained quiet for a moment. Then, Lloyd interjected.\n[Lloyd H.K.: She definitely likes him.]\n[Erian Ruparte: Doesn’t she just like him as a strong hero...? Though I felt that exchange just now was a bit strange as well. Did she just acknowledge him as her partner? It seems like Retadane, who had always acted alone, is finally forming a party.]\n[Prince Altania: Uaaaah. That woman’s really unpleasant! Hey, Junior! PM me a little later!]\n[Lee Shin Woo: Senior, please don’t shorten it like that.]\nSeira Von Retadane. He couldn’t get a read on her. But it was a fact that accompanying her to Bayran and watching her would be more comfortable for him than sending her off by herself. Especially because Seagald may interfere.\n’It’ll be a lot harder to use Wild Card it seems.’\nWild Card was the ability to set up a stage where his victory was absolute. However, it first required that he completely understood the situation and its many variables. Adding in a level 8 hero like her would create more problems for him. But recognizing and controlling those factors was what the Joker karma was all about.\n’I can’t forget about my promise with Pleine either.’\nEven if he let her foolishly enter Bayran alone, all that awaited her was a dog’s death at the hands of Arema Steelworker or Seagald Von Retadane. He was glad that she was being more active in overthrowing the Underground Empire, but no matter how enthusiastic she was, she would still die.\n[Lee Shin Woo: I feel like she made the decision on a whim, but it feels good to form a party with such a powerful Battle Priest... In any case, for the time being, please don’t even think of approaching Bayran.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Shin Woo, hit me up with a private chat later. I want to know how far you two went... Guek!]\n[Erian Ruparte: She may not look it, but Retadane is a delicate woman. She’s deeply regretful too. ...Lee Shin Woo, please take care of her. I trust you.]\nContrary to the witless Lloyd, Erian implored him to understand her, as she was a woman herself. To Lee Shin Woo, Seira Von Retadane’s inner darkness wasn’t as simple as she suggested, but he nodded his head for now. However...\n[Prince Altania: PM. Gogo.]\n[Ms. Prince Altania has left the chat.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: ...]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Seems like Prince likes Lee Shin Woo too.]\n[Erian Ruparte: Lloyd, please don’t say that to Prince. Seriously.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Of course I won’t. Do I really look that witless? I won’t tell her in person.]\n[Erian Ruparte: Oh, Lord...]\nErian sighed. Lee Shin Woo grinned and was getting ready to leave the chatting channel. However, there was something that he remembered.\n[Lee Shin Woo: What about our rookie? Silene Viesa.]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Ah... That guy. I haven’t seen him lately.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: ...Hm.]\n[Erian Ruparte: I’m worried that something might have happened to him. Since we can still request a private chat, he’s not dead, but...] ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ NoveI~Fire.net\n[Lee Shin Woo: I’ll try to contact him later.]\nHe felt uneasy. ’It’s too late’, he suddenly thought. What could’ve happened during the two months he’d been gone? In any case, he would eventually learn Silene Viesa’s fate so long as he was still here.\nIf he could, he would at least pick up Silene Viesa’s bone. He then left the chatting channel. It was fine since the private chat request hadn’t disconnected. Lee Shin Woo had gotten a private chat request from both Kratia and Prince simultaneously, but he chose Kratia first.\n\"It’s been a while.\"\n[Yeah. Good job.]\nHe decided not to ask. She seemed to agree with him, as she went on to the main point.\n[Bayran. We’ll go there too. Our special training’s done with, and Prince has gotten a lot better (personality wise).]\n\"There’s a chance that Arema Steelworker, Seagald Von Retadane, and the other 12 Generals will show up. To put it bluntly, it’ll be dangerous for you too.\"\n[We’ve trained enough. I want to become stronger now too. Like you.]\n\"...How did you know?\"\n[Shin Woo, you may seem bold, but you’re actually quite thorough. If you weren’t at least level 8 by now, then you wouldn’t be going there. You’ve probably gotten some new ability too. I can’t wait. I really want to see it.]\nAs expected, her intuition was sharp. Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and agreed with her. But he didn’t forget to warn her.\n\"I may not be able to keep you safe. You might die.\"\n[I’m like you, Shin Woo. I won’t go if there’s a chance that I could die. If I do die, then it’s because I miscalculated. I won’t hate you.]\n\"If you die, then it’ll feel pretty awkward for me, but... Well, whatever. If you’re that confident, then I’ll leave you to it. Ah, Senior Prince too.\"\n[If need be, make me into a named undead. I like being a human, but being an undead would be kind of interesting too.]\n\"Don’t say that kind of thing, even as a joke.\"\nLee Shin Woo exchanged a few more words with her, and after designating the time and place they were going to meet, closed the private chat. He then declined Prince’s private chat request since she was with Kratia, and decided to just ignore her for now. After all, harassing her like this would get a better reaction out of her.\n\"So wait. Three more girls are going to be joining up with us? We’ve just gotten away from Jin Jin and that spirit...\"\n\"Is that really that important?\"\n\"It is.\"\nJin kicked the air with her legs, as if she were displeased and fluttered her steel-covered wings. (they were currently flying)\nShe’d lowered her speed so that the Chi Pauls would be able to follow them, but she slowed down even more (the Chi Pauls were Chimeras, so they were capable of morphing their bodies; with it, they could change their stats slightly. Their ’running mode’ was fast enough to keep up with Jin, who was flying at a leisurely pace).\n\"Let’s make some time for just the two of us. Feel free to train your skills in the meantime.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Shin Woo was speechless at the loving and honest skeleton horse’s response and trained his skills as she suggested. He imparted his mana into the seventeen weapons floating around them and controlled them; at the same time, he trained his Manatization! If he felt it became too easy, then he would study the Light element as well!\n[The High Rank Light element has become Lv5 and Magic has increased by 20!]\nHe had started training it last, but it was the first to level up. He was astonished that it had gone all the way up to level 5 when he had gotten it just a short while ago. But by absorbing the Garuda’s bone and the Shining Bone Sword, his understanding of the light element had deepened. Therefore, it wasn’t completely unreasonable that he was making such progress with it.\n\"You’re not going to train those innate elements or what not?\"\n\"Studying an innate element requires that I understand my own existence. In other words, you can’t attain them by focusing on a single point. It only becomes meaningful when other people are added into the fray, and their focus points are linked and fused together with your own. So, making a lame attempt by yourself won’t get you anywhere. Moreover, it’s not something you can train while you’re on the move either.\"\nThey weren’t innate elements for nothing. The Dark Shadow element, which was only at the beginner level, was a lot harder to use and used much more mana than the high rank light element. Of course, he could gather that much mana in the blink of an eye now!\n[The Manatization skill has become Lv2, and Health and Magic have increased by 10. A portion of your skin is manatized. Although your physical strength decreases, you have a chance to ignore physical attacks. A portion of your Strength, Health, and Agility are manatized.]\nNext up was his Manatization. This skill would manatize more and more of his body, depending on its level. As Lee Shin Woo had expected, this skill had changed his other stats into magic, from the tens to the hundreds, once it had leveled up.\nJust in case, he tested it out. He was able to ’redefine’ himself whenever he wanted to redistribute his stats. This was as expected as well. Lee Shin Woo had a really high affinity with this skill. It was a skill that would help him become whatever he wanted... a skill comparable to the Joker’s innate skills!\n\"If I could, I’d coop myself up somewhere and train, but the situation won’t allow it.\"\n\"Shin Woo, I honestly think that you can already do whatever you want right now.\"\n\"Jin, I’m the type who gets to the max level before fighting the boss.\"\n\"I have no idea what you’re talking about...\"\nShe didn’t understand what he was saying, but as she wanted, they were alone together and they could talk freely. Before they left, Lee Shin Woo had inspected himself, which allowed him to level up his skills.\n[The Manatization skill has become Lv3 and Health and Magic have increased by 10. A portion of your internal body is manatized and you can more effectively handle mana. But at the same time, your muscular strength decreases proportionally. A portion of your Strength, Health, and Magic is manatized.]\n\"If I can, I’d like to level it up to level 5 before I get there. But is it not possible for a high rank skill like this?\"\n\"It’s amazing that you were even able to level it up to level 3 in such a short period of time.\"\nLee Shin Woo touched his halfway transparent hand and inspected his Manatization skill for the last time. After that, he returned his hand to its normal, human state. His stats, which had been converted into mana, were returned to their original values as well.\nHe wasn’t entirely sure before he’d started training his skills, but now he was. Once he mastered this skill and leveled up his Disguise skill even further, his bone-related skills would be able to affect everything, not just bone!\n\"...But Shin Woo, why do you think Seira Von Retadane is going to Bayran all of a sudden? Did she figure out where the Fire Slayer Sword God or the Golden General were going?\"\n\"That’s unlikely. She said she was going there before I even said anything, so she has no ulterior motive for me... Ah!\"\nThey had gotten close to their destination and gradually began their descent. Lee Shin Woo, who’d finished inspecting his skills and had been talking to Jin, realized one possibility and was shocked.\n\"Retadane took most of the loot from killing the Vulture General... If that’s the case, then maybe she has one of the Bayran Inner Maps too.\"\n\"Then there are four of them. It’s safer now, so isn’t that better for us?\"\n\"It is.\"\nJin cheered, and Lee Shin Woo agreed with him. Immediately after, his voice became slightly lower.\n\"If I could tell her that I killed two more of the 12 Generals, that is.\"\n\"Oh...\"\nHe could already see the three women from afar waiting at their meeting place. It was time to make a choice. Lee Shin Woo briefly thought about it and soon made his decision.",

    "content": "<Chapter 44. Bayran Infiltration - 3>\n\"I see you two came as well. It doesn’t matter to me... As long as you don’t hold me back.\"\nOnce she saw Prince and Kratia, Seira Von Retadane shrugged her shoulders and said. She was being genuine, but she still managed to piss Prince off.\n\"Hold you back!? Didn’t you see me use that really strong spell back then? You ever heard of the Fire Demon?\"\n\"Yes, I saw it. It was indeed a powerful spell, but I’m not sure you’ll be able to protect yourself with it. A magician is most powerful when protected by several of their allies. However, there aren’t that many of us, and we’re attempting to infiltrate a city where we don’t know how many enemies there are or where they are. I do believe you’re not cut out for this.\"\n\"But...!\"\n\"And please call me Retadane.\"\n\"Ugh.\"\nRetadane pointed out her flaws, being correct from start to finish, and Prince became weak. Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and added.\n\"We’ll have to move covertly, but I’ll take care of it. Since I have just the skill for it.\"\n\"As expected of my Junior! You do the things that Retadane can’t do so naturally! It makes me shiver in excitement!\"\n\"That sounds incredibly unpleasant. You’re spiteful towards me for some reason, while you’re really possessive of Lee Shin Woo. ...Though I don’t have any complaints if you can deal with the issue of stealth.\"\nIt seemed only natural that she acted this way if he took into consideration that she was a level 8 hero with the highest seniority, but... To Lee Shin Woo, who knew about all the forces involved with Bayran and the inside story on Retadane, he felt like her actions were foolish, or even a bit cute.\n’She must be hoping that Seagald doesn’t come.’\nHe briefly organized his thoughts and then asked Retadane. This was to put the decision he’d made beforehand into motion.\n\"Retadane, do you have a reason for going to Bayran?\"\n\"Yes. Now that you mention it, I wanted to talk about that.\"\nRetadane then pulled out a piece of paper from her chest. As he suspected, it was a Bayran Inner Map.\n\"Ooooooooh!\"\n\"Hm.\"\n\"I got this from the Vulture General. You should remember seeing it when I was distributing the loot. It seems like it’s only given to the one who inflicted the most damage to him. In this case, me.\"\nAs expected, that’s why the map had automatically come to him when he’d killed the Beast General. Lee Shin Woo thoroughly looked over the map. While he was analyzing the map and mentally comparing it to the other maps he owned, she continued to speak.\n\"I wondered why this came off of one of the 12 Generals, and also suspected that it might be a trap... I came to the conclusion that I needed to see for myself. After that, I investigated for two months and prepared my skills and equipment... When I was about to leave, Lee Shin Woo mentioned Bayran.\"\n\"So what, you think it was fate?\"\nRetadane explained calmly, but it seemed like Prince found something unpleasant about it, as she pouted suddenly. Then, Retadane nodded her head seriously.\n\"Yes. The fact that Lee Shin Woo was headed to Bayran too means that God is leading us there. I feel like there’s something important in Bayran. Something that’s related to our purification of the Underground Empire.\"\n\"...Oh, that’s what you were talking about?\"\n\"What else is there?\"\n\"Oh, nothing. Never mind.\"\nRetadane ignored Prince’s clearly suspicious signs (Kratia softly hit the back of Prince’s head instead and Lee Shin Woo inwardly applauded) and went deeper into her motives. Read full story at novel·fıre·net\n\"Moreover... Moreover, I know this place well.\"\n\"You know this place well... Perhaps...?\"\n\"No. My family wasn’t responsible for this area. It’s just that... this place was created for a special reason.\"\n\"A special reason...\"\n\"Yes. ...This city was created for spirits.\"\nFor a moment, Lee Shin Woo stopped moving. Retadane retained her bitter expression.\n\"The citizens of the Empire loved spirits. They believed that spirits were God’s representatives and that their forms were far more developed than humans’. Thus, Elementalists, who could commune with spirits and borrow their power, were treated very well.\"\n\"...I see.\"\nThat’s only natural. Since only those who loved spirits and the spirits themselves were sent underground. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and Kratia’s eyes shined.\n\"Most magicians reject Elementalists. Since their power often goes against a magician’s reason. Like Shin Woo.\"\n\"You didn’t have to add that last part.\"\n\"It’s strange that the Empire, which had progressed their magic engineering so far, would love spirits so much.\"\n\"There were, of course, some people within the Empire that hated spirits as well.\"\nRetadane confirmed Kratia’s theory with a nod of her head.\n\"Bayran was created to protect the spirits and the Elementalists from such individuals. It’s connected directly to the capital, the lake is clean and beautiful, and there are several mountains around it. It’s a place well-suited for the spirits. The palace’s Elementalist Order used Bayran as a branch office as well.\"\n\"And what about protecting the spirits?\"\n\"If the spirits are scattered, then there’s a chance that they’ll be hunted down by humans, but if they’re all in one place, then even the entire Knight Order would be no match for them. The Empire wanted to create a place where the spirits could stay and relax. ...Though it was a failure.\"\n\"A failure, huh.\"\nPerhaps joining up with Retadane had been a good idea. Since there was no other way to obtain such detailed information about the Empire, aside from someone who had actually lived during that time!\nLee Shin Woo inwardly nodded in satisfaction at granny Retadane’s story as she was just getting to the climax of the story.\n\"They wanted to create a special dungeon called the ’Spirits’ Spring’ within Bayran. They sought to create a space where only spirits and those the spirits permitted could enter, but... In the process, something went wrong. The palace’s Elementalist Leader, Princess Dana Von Etliber was put in charge of creating the Spirits’ Spring... and was also put in charge of Bayran as well.\"\n\"Dana Von Etliber.\"\nHe could tell how this was going to end. Lee Shin Woo had heard this story and this person’s name before. Lee Shin Woo narrowed his eyes and Retadane continued calmly. He briefly felt an indescribable sadness and fury from her expression, but Lee Shin Woo wanted to believe that it was just a delusion. He wanted to believe it was, but...\n\"She is also one of the 12 Generals, called the Spirit General. To this day, she’s probably still in Bayran.\"\n\"!?\"\nKratia and Prince’s eyes widened. Lee Shin Woo just sighed.\n\"We don’t know whether or not the other 12 Generals will come, but there’s already one of them there.\"\n\"Plus, it should be filled with several corrupted spirits as well. Even so, I will find her. I was scared thus far, but... I believe now is the time to go looking for her. Lee Shin Woo, could you please help me? Are you prepared to fight against the 12 Generals?\"\n\"Yes. After all, it’s our duty to take down the 12 Generals.\"\n\"Good. Just keep thinking like that. ...You’re quite reliable. Please make sure I don’t lose my way.\"\nIt seemed like she was trying her best to not show any signs, but Lee Shin Woo could hear the loneliness within her voice. Retadane, who was likely the daughter of a duke, must’ve been close with the princess.\nHe thought she was just a crazy woman who was only interested in killing the undead, but looking at her now, perhaps her hatred towards the undead wasn’t so simple... He felt that pointless feeling slightly, very slightly.\n\"With this party, killing the 12 Generals is... No, it’s a piece of cake. We’ve only gathered elites!\"\n\"If we exclude you, Prince.\"\n\"Why would you exclude me!? I’ve gotten a lot stronger too! I’ve really gotten a lot stronger!\"\n\"Taking on one of the 12 Generals isn’t an issue. I already told you. That there wouldn’t be just one or two of them there. ...If you’re not confident, then you can turn around now.\"\nPrince was pissed as she hung onto Kratia and questioned Retadane, but Lee Shin Woo replied calmly. Hearing that, Prince straightened her back, as if ice had been poured onto it, and responded confidently, even while pouting.\n\"I’m all ready. I’m just shaking a bit! Since I’m so excited!\"\n\"Then you’re fine. I came prepared too, so I have something to show you.\"\nLee Shin Woo then took out three pieces of paper. The three women tilted their heads, but one of them stiffened at the sight of the papers.\n\"These are...\"\n\"They’re all Bayran Inner Maps...\"\n\"Lee Shin Woo, where did you get these?\"\n\"I got each of them from a different member of the 12 Generals.\"\n\"What!?\"\nKratia remained calm, as it wasn’t news to her. Prince’s pupils shook. Seira Von Retadane didn’t even respond; she just looked stiff. Lee Shin Woo didn’t give them a chance to respond and continued.\n\"I’m not sure how Bayran was when you last saw it, but the imperial troops have made a lot of changes to it. And if we put all the maps together, then...\"\n\"Wait, it’s filled with traps everywhere! Such vicious traps at that!\"\n\"The worst part about it is that there may be more maps than just these four. There are twelve generals, per their title. But the chance of that is low. Of course, there may be some fakes among the maps, but... with this many of them, we should be able to pick the safest route by comparing them, no?\"\nHe was originally going to do this, but he didn’t say that and just looked at Retadane. She was still looking at the maps with a stiff expression, but once she realized that he was waiting for her response, she quietly agreed.\n\"My knowledge will be helpful in your analysis. But we’ll need some time to prepare. We should stay here before we infiltrate the city. I’m sorry everyone, but could you prepare the camp?\"\n\"Of course.\"\nShe probably had much she wanted to ask him and much she wanted to tell him, but she generously let it go. Whereas Prince looked like she wanted to ask Lee Shin Woo a hundred questions, but Kratia immediately stopped her.\n\"You knew, didn’t you!? That my Junior took down some of the other 12 Generals alone!\"\n\"Of course. Since I was with him each time. So technically he didn’t take them down alone. We took them down together.\"\n\"Aaaaaaaah!\"\nLee Shin Woo had not only killed a few of the 12 Generals in an unknown place without her knowledge, but Lee Shin Woo and Kratia had taken them out, just the two of them (though Jin was actually with them as well!). Upon this realization, Prince screamed and was hit by Kratia again.\n\"Why didn’t you tell me...?\"\n\"I knew you’d worry about me. I’m sorry, Senior. We didn’t fight them because we wanted to. We had the misfortune of running into them, so we had no choice but to fight them to survive.\"\n\"Ahhhhhh!\"\nIt was a lie, of course, but Lee Shin Woo’s acting was enough to trick her. Retadane, who was standing beside them and perusing the maps, nodded slightly. She probably attributed that to why ’Lee Shin Woo was so strong’.\n\"...In any case, I’ve gotten a lot stronger too. You don’t need to do something so dangerous alone anymore. Just follow me!\"\n\"Ok, Senior. Then please help me set up this tent.\"\n\"Leave it to me!\"\nHe really loved idiots; they were so easy to manipulate... Lee Shin Woo watched Prince busily move around to set up the tent and smiled. Beside him, Kratia and Jin were speechless, but as always, Lee Shin Woo just ignored them.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 44 part4",
    "content": "<Chapter 44. Bayran Infiltration - 4>\nPrince groaned as she attempted to set up the tent, but was unable to, so Kratia came over to help. While they were at it, Lee Shin Woo started cooking dinner. He took out fresh vegetables and meat from his inventory, and even had rice, which was all hard to acquire, even from the secret shop. Seeing that, Prince’s eyes popped out.\n\"Where did you get that!? Did you go to the surface or something?\"\n\"I obviously bought it from the secret shop.\"\nOf course he’d brought it from the surface. He had stored the Lawrence shop’s best products in his inventory, but he’d never have guessed that she’d figure it out on her first try! Lee Shin Woo was shocked by her insight and somehow gave her the slip, but it unfortunately had the opposite effect.\n\"Liar. I’ve never seen such juicy meat before... What kind of meat is this? No, the meat’s one thing, but I’ve never seen this grain in the secret shop before! I’ve never seen these spices before either!\"\n\"Shin Woo, you know how to cook too?\"\n\"Yeah, I know camp cooking. Wait and see. You’ll love it.\"\nWhile Lee Shin Woo prepared a fire and the food, Prince and Kratia hung around him, fiddling with the meat’s bone or chewing on the uncooked rice rather than setting up the tent. It seemed like they couldn’t believe how good the ingredients were. Then, Retadane, who had been diligently studying the maps, silently said.\n\"Saving the best products and giving them to her favorites is just like her.\"\n\"What!? Junior, are you and that terrifying shopkeeper...\"\n\"Senior, this is all money. You can buy the shopkeeper’s affection with money.\"\n\"Affection!? As I thought, you...!\"\n\"Ah, this senior’s a real pain in the ass.\"\nThe dinner menu consisted of a stew that consisted of meat, veggies, and wine. He’d also used the meat’s fat to fry off some Arancini as well.\nThe stew and the rice were finished at the same time. He added in the leftover veggies, meat, and cheese from his inventory, and then crushed the bread into a fine powder. Lee Shin Woo coated the mixture and fried it off. If he were to add a hot ragu sauce, it’d be perfect.\n\"This really is a man’s cooking...\"\n\"That’s what I said. Please make do with this ready-made sauce.\"\n\"I’ve never seen this ’ready-made’ sauce before. Mm, it’s delicious!\"\nPrince grabbed the Arancini with both hands and downed them, throwing all etiquette away with the wind. Kratia didn’t really like eating, but it seemed like she was satisfied with the taste, and Retadane was surprisingly a glutton.\nHer face was as icy as ever, but he could tell that she was satisfied with the meal based on how much she ate.\n\"Thank you for the fine meal. It’s not nearly enough in return, but I’ll brew us some tea.\"\n\"Thank you. How’s it going...?\"\n\"I keep looking at the maps, but it’s hard. It may be impossible to find a route without any danger.\"\n\"When I’m finished cleaning, I’ll come and help you.\"\nOnce they were finished doing the dishes and preparing camp, the four gathered around and put all their attention into finding the safest route. They were shocked by how large Bayran was, and they were just as surprised to find that the Empire had laid magic traps all over the city.\n\"Why did they have to go this far...? Wasn’t this a city designed for spirits?\"\n\"...This... It seems to operate by drawing magic from the city’s inhabitants. There must’ve been another reason.\"\n\"Probably. Last I saw her, the princess was really tired, and she seemed to be hesitating about something. Perhaps another project was underway at the same time as the Spirits’ Spring project.\"\n\"The Spirits’ Spring Project...\"\nThe party studied the maps and conversed; in the middle of that, Lee Shin Woo dwelled on the word ’Spirits’ Spring’. At first, he’d thought they were modeling it after the Spirits’ Spring on the surface, but there was a chance that it was something else entirely.\nEspecially because Bayran was covered by a type of mana he was quite familiar with... spatial mana. It was even more likely if the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin, was involved with the city.\n’Well, I guess I’ll find out when I get inside. And so long as the Archmage himself doesn’t appear, I have nothing to worry about.’\nHe was able to get Retadane’s help, so the current situation was a lot better than he’d anticipated.\nThey were beginning to decipher the contents of the maps and Lee Shin Woo relayed these details to the faraway Chi Paul through his Assimilation skill and his darkness element induced telepathy, and nodded his head. The sight of the Empire’s darkness covering Bayran made him feel like a demon would pop out.\n\"In other words, they’re on my stage...\"\n\"What did you just say, Junior?\"\n\"Nothing. I’m just excited as to how strong our enemies will be.\"\nWith Retadane’s memories and the four maps, as well as Lee Shin Woo’s insight, they were able to complete the map by tomorrow morning.\n\"If we go through this route, then... we should be able to avoid critical danger.\"\n\"Even if we can deal with the magical traps, we can’t deal with all the physical ones. If we’re unlucky, then... we may end up with normal critical injuries.\"\n\"I don’t think critical injuries are normal in any way...!\"\n\"There are also critical, critical injuries.\"\n\"!?\"\nThe four heroes (+Jin) had finished off yesterday’s stew, steeled themselves, and set off on their designated route. Fortunately, there was no threat of danger along the way, but the closer they got to the city’s walls, the more shocked they were by the scale of the city.\n\"What a huge moat.\"\n\"It must be hard for humans to manage. To my knowledge, it was cared for with the help of water spirits, but... I’m not sure how it is anymore.\"\n[Kyahaaaaaah!]\nOnce Retadane was finished talking, they heard a shriek from the center of the moat, which was wide enough to be a lake. Lee Shin Woo could see the spirits coming up from underneath the water.\n[Lv5 Corrupted Undine]\nIts translucent body, reminiscent of slimes’, was mixed with foul water. If they were all at the ’corrupted’ stage, then it meant that there was no helping them anymore. They were far too contaminated. Upon seeing the spirit in such a state, Lee Shin Woo bitterly smacked his lips, but then, more and more Corrupted Undines popped up everywhere.\n\"There were other dangers aside from the traps I see.\"\n\"They’re probably here to distract you enough to set off the traps. The entire city is set up with traps designed to kill intruders.\"\n\"But we’re lucky. This is easy.\"\nKratia quietly took a step forward and extended her hand. The tiny orb, the Eternal Ice shined, and radiated light within the air. Then, the plentiful water filling the moat froze over.\n[G-Giiik...!]\n[Gigigigigigi]\nThe Corrupted Undines were also caught by her spell, and merely screamed, as they couldn’t get out of the ice. Kratia ignored their cries and took another step forward. The moat was frozen solid, so they could walk wherever they pleased. The party watched, dumbfounded, then hesitated for a moment before following after her.\n\"To think you were able to freeze such a large area...\"\n\"You didn’t reach level 8 already, did you...?\"\nLee Shin Woo killed one of the Corrupted Undine to see what loot they dropped, but he already possessed both high rank water and ice elements, so he didn’t feel as though their drops would increase them any further. If they had any effect, then he might’ve sent his party off first, stayed back, and killed the undines.\n’Chi Paul. Take this opportunity to go into the city too. Mm... If you’re this far away, there’s no chance of you running into us.’\n[Understood. Once we’ve safely infiltrated the city, I will report to you again.]\nThey crossed over the frozen moat and were met by the front gate. This was also Kratia’s job. It was set up so that a person without sufficient magical knowledge would be unable to open it without being bombarded by magic shells.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo had figured out that around half of the mechanisms that fired those magic shells were already broken. They were destroyed so technically and delicately that a normal person would not likely realize it.\n\"It seems like someone’s already inside.\"\n\"The imperial troops wouldn’t have been caught by the traps. So then who would... Ah.\"\nShe must’ve come to a realization as she spoke. While speaking, Retadane’s complexion changed. Her eyebrows wriggled ever so slightly. Lee Shin Woo just shrugged his shoulders.\n\"I wonder. Perhaps it’s another faction unrelated to the imperial army.\"\n\"Lee Shin Woo... you knew?\"\n\"I’m not privy to the details, but I had a hunch. I don’t know what they’re doing inside, so... let’s hurry.\"\n\"Keuk.\"\nBut no matter how rushed they were, they actually didn’t progress that quickly. It was because the very core of the magic traps that covered Bayran was spatial magic.\nFeotane Von Seldin had put his heart and soul into this giant magic circle that covered the city. It would blur one’s senses, partially distort the surrounding space, reduce it, and ultimately not allow one to move as they wished. Even if one knew the right path, one would have to go round and round in order to escape the effects of the spatial magic!\nMoreover, there were magic circles across the city that sucked in magic. These would steal magic from anyone lost in the city and torment them. What’s worse, these magic circles would use the stolen magic to activate the magic traps! It was like a demonic world.\n\"Would the capital also be like this?\"\n\"What could they possibly be hiding that they’re going to all the effort to...\"\n\"Magic. Terrifying magic.\"\nKratia, who had been constantly emitting her mana and leading the party on the right path, quietly reported. Lee Shin Woo sympathized with her and nodded his head.\n\"There’s a high concentration of magic focused in one place, which cannot be explained by human logic. Spirits’ Spring? No. The magic’s far too aggressive. Countless elements are gathered in one place, but it’s not natural. I’m curious what Shin Woo thinks, since he’s a spirit expert.\"\n\"I’m no spirit expert. ...I won’t know until I get close. But I do wonder whether this place was really set up for spirits.\"\nLee Shin Woo could understand that the undines were corrupted by the undead curse. That was fine.\nBut he felt as though the traps and the magic circles across the city weren’t there just to repel invaders; they were also set up for a specific reason or purpose. That feeling was even stronger after actually infiltrating the city and looking into it further.\n\"This isn’t a city designed for someone to live in. Rather, it’s a fortress city created for a specific purpose... No, that’s not it either.\"\nLee Shin Woo was keeping it a secret from his party, but he could overcome the spatial magic at any time. Therefore, he could ignore the spatial magic current, which would otherwise obscure his vision of anything further than 100 meters, and looked at the building in the center of the city. The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the novel•fire.net\nHe saw a metal cylinder aimed towards the sky. Every kind of magic circle imaginable was placed on it; that alone was enough to evoke a sense of danger, but even now, Lee Shin Woo could feel various currents of mana being gathered into it.\nIf he ignored the enormous quantity of mana, then it looked like a cannon.\n\"It feels like this entire city was sacrificed to complete a weapon... No, it’s already complete, but it was left alone for so long that it was heavily modified.\"\n\"A weapon?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nLee Shin Woo had widened his senses, which had enabled him to see the cannon, as well as something else. He’d felt this mana signature before... Arema Steelworker was over there. He was getting closer and closer to the center of the city, where the cannon was located. ...well, he was getting closer and closer, but because of Feotane Von Seldin’s magic, he was going at a very slow pace.\n\"I feel another person’s magic too. We should really hold a party.\"\n\"So what are you saying?\"\n\"We should quicken our pace. Now isn’t the time to be worrying about spirits.\"\nSo many heroes had gathered in one place, so he thought they’d be able to take care of this easily. However, the Heaven Defying General may need to take center stage. Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and grabbed the map. Retadane just quietly watched him.",

    "content": "<Chapter 44. Bayran Infiltration - 5>\n\"This way is safe. We’ll be fine as long as we go this way.\"\n\"Oh? I thought this spot originally had traps...\"\n\"The traps have been destroyed.\"\nOnce he’d sensed Arema Steelworker’s energy, Lee Shin Woo had volunteered to lead the group. Prince was the first to notice that they progressed at a much faster pace.\n\"Junior, what are you doing? For some reason, it’s become easier to walk and I’m not as dizzy as before.\"\n\"I was conserving my magic before, so that I wouldn’t use more than is strictly necessary, but I felt like I’d miss something important. So I’ve taken out my secret weapon.\"\nLee Shin Woo said, and with the hand not grasping the map... gripped his delicately made, snow-white bone sword. The faint light that it emitted relaxed his party. Retadane noticed how high the concentration of light was and said.\n\"It’s a light element weapon, I see.\"\n\"Yes. As you know, the light element possesses the ability to sever things. This weapon focuses that ability into defense, and it also has a maximized special active skill as well. With this ability, I can remove some of the spatial magic that is meddling with us.\"\n\"Uooooh. Nice!\"\nPrince was pointlessly amazed. However, the weapon didn’t actually have an ability like that! It did possess the special passive skill (Death God’s Smile) and the special active skill (Death God’s Fury), but they were more designed to kill one’s opponent.\nLee Shin Woo was using his Wild Card skill as the base and from there, used his light and shining flame elements to eliminate the effects of the spatial magic.\n\"Junior, where did you find such an amazing weapon?\"\n\"I got it from the treasure box after beating the boss of a level 7 dungeon. I was really lucky.\"\n\"A level 7 dungeon...!?\"\nHe wasn’t lying. When he had first entered the dungeon, it was certainly an elite level 7 dungeon. Although, it had become a level 8 dungeon later and the boss was a level 9 Garuda!\nBut it seemed like his lie was still enough to astound his party members. Especially Prince, who was the most shocked.\n\"Level 7! ...Level 7!?\"\n\"Ah, please quiet down, Senior.\"\n\"Then what level is that weapon? Level 6? Level 7? Wait, it’s not...\"\n\"Yes, it is.\"\n\"Level 8!? It’s just a weapon, but it’s a higher level than me!?\"\nPrince rolled on the floor, mortified. Lee Shin Woo watched on, speechless. Then, Retadane interjected.\n\"The fact that you obtained a level 8 weapon, a light element weapon at that... Was the dungeon boss level 8 by any chance?\"\n\"It seemed like it’d just become level 8. However, it was indeed level 8. I had to prepare a lot beforehand to take him down. I got some help from the secret shop too. The reason I was out of contact for so long was because I was so busy clearing that dungeon...\"\nThe boss had, in no way, ’just become a level 8’. And although it had been weakened, it was still a level 9 divine bird that had remained trapped for hundreds of years. Plus, Lee Shin Woo had pretty much only bought bones from the secret shop!\n\"Since you’ve taken down three of the 12 Generals, you must’ve had plenty of Perium. I’ve never bought expendable equipment from the secret shop before, but if that woman supported you fully, then...\"\nRetadane was dumbfounded, yet nodded her head. He was sure that, right now, she was thinking of Pleine as a wasteful woman.\nThe misunderstanding between the sisters was deepening, and may even lead to a feud in the future! However, Lee Shin Woo decided not to worry about trivial matters.\n\"But even so, if you’re not strong enough, then it would still be impossible. In other words... Lee Shin Woo, are you level 8?\"\nHe pondered briefly, but there was a chance that he’d have to show a portion of his power in this city. If that’s the case, then it would be impossible to hide his level. Lee Shin Woo didn’t really feel the necessity in hiding it any longer either. Thus, he just honestly nodded his head and said.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"...I thought you’d shown us all your tricks, but to think there was even more to you. I’m surprised. You’re always showing me something unbelievable.\"\nThis time, Retadane was actually shocked. It wasn’t because she’d come to know that Lee Shin Woo was level 8. It was that she hadn’t recognized how powerful he was before now.\nNormally, the ’level’ of one’s existence is shown freely, and one would need to work tirelessly to hide it. But to her, Lee Shin Woo had never shown a ’level’ that was similar to hers.\n\"I was level 7 then, Retadane. It was only after that I reached level 8, by going through a variety of experiences. You can trust me.\"\n\"...I thought I was the one testing you, but it seems like you were the one testing us all along.\"\n\"I wasn’t testing you. I think of you all as trustworthy comrades. Ah, that includes Senior Lloyd and Senior Erian as well.\"\n\"Comrades...\"\nComrades. Retadane let that word roll off her tongue a few times and then smiled bitterly, as if she’d just eaten licorice.\nLee Shin Woo could tell that she was repulsed by the idea and merely smiled. She had been a hero for dozens of years and had gone through every kind of ordeal imaginable, so she may have felt that it was pretentious of him to say.\n\"Retadane, regardless of what you think...\"\n\"Shin Woo, something’s coming.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nBut before Lee Shin Woo could tell her anything, Kratia curtly warned him. Spirits. He didn’t know what allowed them to move freely without being affected by the spatial magic, but all of the corrupted spirits in the city were coming for them.\n[Lv5 Corrupted Sylph] Thɪs chapter is updated by n0velfire.net\n[Lv5 Corrupted Salamander]\nThe large force was mostly composed of Sylphs and Salamanders. The fire and wind spirits mixed together, becoming a black storm that came rushing towards them; the sight of which was truly frightening.\nSpirits were composed of pure elemental mana. This was their greatest feature, and the more spirits there were, the more their power would increase (exponentially)!\n\"There’re tens of thousands of them at least!\"\n\"We’ll intercept them. Focus on your magic!\"\nRetadane and Kratia were already poised to intercept them. However, the firestorm was so large that they were akin to a speck of dust. They didn’t know what to do to push them back.\nUnfortunately, the spirits were unaffected by the spatial magic and didn’t set off the traps either. On the contrary, they received mana from them and their attacks became even greater than before.\n\"Fire Demon! Tch, you should’ve attacked the other trespassers instead!\"\nPrince summoned the Fire Demon much faster than before, perhaps due to her special training with Kratia, and complained. Then... the coming firestorm that had been coming straight for them began to go astray.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What the hell is that?\"\nThey found it strange, yet they didn’t let their guard down. However, the firestorm went more and more astray. As more time passed, the firestorm completely missed them and ran off into a completely different direction.\nThen, the firestorm descended. Someone was fighting off the firestorm and gathering their mana. The Corrupted Sylphs and Salamanders were truly attacking another invader!\n\"Senior...\"\n\"Prince Altania...\"\nLee Shin Woo stared blankly at Prince, and the other party members soon followed. Kratia quietly said.\n\"Prince, when did you learn Word Magic?\"\n\"Hehe...\"\nShe wasn’t entirely sure what was going on, but since it’d gone favorably for them, she decided to bluff. Prince swept her hanging silver hair with one hand and with a haughty expression, declared!\n\"Those spirits definitely changed directions after I spoke up!\"\n\"There’s no way you know Word Magic, but I’m glad the situation was resolved well. We must continue with caution. Lee Shin Woo, please continue to lead us.\"\n\"Ok. Let’s take the shortest route.\"\n\"Then why did you even praise me in the first place!? Hey! Are you really going to embarrass me like this!?\"\nBut the events continued to repeat. While Lee Shin Woo nullified the spatial magic and they went full speed ahead towards the center of the city, they sprung a few unavoidable traps (traps that would randomly draw nearby spirits and traps that summoned monsters out of nowhere). Despite that, the traps had all avoided their party.\n\"W-What’s going on?\"\n\"Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth. Perhaps they’re afraid of the light element?\"\n\"It’s possible if my weapon’s hidden ability activated, but... this is too much. Perhaps another group of trespassers are provoking them that much more. Regardless... we have no choice but to take advantage of this opportunity and go deeper into the city.\"\nThe party had stubbornly advanced, and the spirits and monsters had taken notice of this! Because they headed for the other invaders, there was a huge commotion within the city. The spirits and monsters slowed the other group’s advance, while allowing Lee Shin Woo’s group to advance even quicker. They couldn’t ask for any better.\n’Is it you?’\n’Of course it is. I did it the moment I sensed the other trespassers.’\nLee Shin Woo shamelessly answered Jin’s question and moved his legs. He was obviously using the Wild Card skill right now. And the element he was using? Dark Shadow!\nHe knew all about the surrounding area, as well as his enemies from afar. With the shadow that loomed over the city, he connected the two together, causing the spirits and monsters to go over to them. This level of twisting cause and effect was child’s play! He could achieve such a result by just manipulating cause and effect, so it was indeed suited to be a Joker’s innate element.\n[The Beginner Dark Shadow element has become Lv7 and Magic has increased by 20.]\n’Oh, it leveled up again.’\nWhen he’d first entered the city and used Dark Shadow, the innate element had leveled up, but one more hour of distorting cause and effect had caused it to level up again!\nLee Shin Woo was looking forward to getting Dark Shadow to the intermediate level. His intermediate dark flame was quite powerful as well, but he could only imagine how powerful his innate element would end up being if he were to level it up to the intermediate level!\n’You were already dangerous before, but now that you’ve gotten an innate element, you’re controlling the situation, even though it doesn’t look like you’re actually doing anything.’\n’That’s the very definition of a Joker.’\nIn the midst of his naive comrades counting their blessings and traversing through the city, Lee Shin Woo and Jin spoke to each other and he smiled wickedly. His poker face should’ve been perfect, but Kratia, who had been watching him, looked sullen.\n\"Shin Woo, you’ve started hiding a lot more from me.\"\n\"Really? I think I’m always being honest.\"\n\"When we’re alone, prepare yourself.\"\n\"Kratia, don’t threaten my Junior.\"\nThe party bickered, yet continued through the city smoothly. It took another hour before they had arrived before the city walls that divided the inner and outer parts of the city.",

    "content": "<Chapter 44. Bayran Infiltration - 6>\nThere existed a high thorn wall that surrounded the palace, which existed at the center of Heita, or the Underground Empire’s, capital. It was the final defense against any invaders and was around 100 meters tall. It also possessed magical properties that allowed it to sense any intruders that would do its master harm beforehand, as well as stopping them from entering.\nWas that all? Its defensive capabilities were without peer, and anyone lower than level 8 couldn’t damage the wall, regardless of what they did.\nIt might go differently if one uses magic or an element, but pure physical strength and skills wouldn’t be able to damage the wall. At this point, it could be considered on the level of an authority. The thorn wall’s defense was absolute, and only after getting through that wall could the heroes even dream of challenging the Emperor.\n\"I didn’t think there’d be one here too...\"\n\"A thorn wall... I caught a glimpse of it once before. It was at least 80 meters tall. Though it does seem smaller than the one in the capital.\"\n\"Last I saw, it wasn’t here. Which means it was created later. As I thought... There were rumors that the Empire was undertaking some secret project that was hidden from even the high rank nobles.\"\nAs expected, there had to be something important here if the defense was so severe. What was the Emperor thinking? And why was the Spirit Princess so deeply involved in this project?\nRetadane looked up at the black, sharp thorned wall in anguish. Lee Shin Woo wasn’t hoping for much, but he asked her anyway.\n\"If you were a high rank noble, then you must know a way to easily tear down this wall, no?\"\n\"...No. All I know is that the nobles who opposed the creation of this wall were killed.\"\n\"Seira, you sure are useless. You’re just old. You’re not even as helpful as our Junior here.\"\n\"Please call me Retadane.\"\n\"Ugaaaaah! My face! My beautiful face is cracking! Junior! Juniooooor!\"\nLee Shin Woo saw Retadane, who was unable to restrain herself, give Prince an iron claw. He then tapped on the thorn wall. It was so tough that he groaned.\n\"What exactly is this made of?\"\n\"’Evil Eye’. It’s said that this ore is formed by long-term exposure from darkness element magic. It is the source of the darkness element here, which is what allowed the Underground Empire to flourish. It’s to my understanding that that ore was mined and used for the creation of the thorn wall.\"\n\"Hoh. So there was a different source of magic, aside from the Emperor’s, that I felt from the capital.\"\n\"Stop talking between yourselves and help me, Junior!\"\nIt would be hard enough to take on the level 9 Emperor, yet he even had this weapon up his sleeve. The more he learned about this damn Underground Empire purification quest, the more difficult it got.\nHe was beginning to understand why God was so depressed.\n\"In other words, the thorn wall is nothing more than a byproduct of that magic source.\"\n\"As I said before, Evil Eye must be exposed to darkness magic for such a long time that we can safely say that this is all they have. I’m actually quite surprised that they even have a thorn wall in Bayran. When exactly did they make it? They likely constructed it right before the Empire’s demise.\"\n\"...Please let her go now. She’s starting to foam at the mouth.\"\n\"Ah.\"\nRetadane let go, and Prince whined, her eyes seemed to be asking him ’why didn’t he help earlier’. Lee Shin Woo consoled her and then investigated the thorn wall.\nThey seemingly placed a great amount of trust in the wall, as there were no traps nearby. When he looked further into it, it was simply because the thorn wall would activate on its own and destroy any nearby traps.\n\"The thorn wall is a fortress in and of itself.\"\n\"So if I were to gather my magic, I’ll get attacked?\"\n\"Yep. It’s really dangerous, everyone stay back.\"\nLee Shin Woo sensed tremendous energy undulations behind the thorn wall. He could feel a large quantity of mana that had been accumulated for dozens of years at the center... as well as a rebellious living energy. Perhaps this was... No, it was definitely a spirit’s energy.\n’A city designed for spirits. ...No, it wasn’t.’\nNow that he’d gotten to the center of Bayran, he was sure of it. This city wasn’t created for spirits. Rather, this city was created to use spirits and to create something with them.\nSpirits’ Spring? There was something that lay dormant inside that didn’t suit such a peaceful and gentle environment. ...Perhaps it hadn’t been able to sleep in the first place.\n’The Spirit General, or the Spirit Princess... Either way, she’s not in the best of shape.’\nAnd he was certain that the Spirit General and Retadane were deeply involved in the past. ’If we go in like this, won’t it just turn into a melodrama?’, Lee Shin Woo thought and sighed deeply.\nWhile investigating the mana, he also looked for the location of the other trespassers. Because he’d activated the traps (through the traps, the spirits and monsters attacked the other trespassers, who had no recollection of ever setting off those traps), they were progressing as slow as a turtle.\n’But... There’s another group coming from the north.’\nWho was it? That was obvious. It was probably a force sent by the Emperor after he’d noticed the commotion. Though they hadn’t entered the city as of yet, he was sure they were coming to Bayran based on their direction and speed.\nAnd thus, the elite heroes, Anti-Skull, Arema Steelworker’s golem force, as well as the imperial troops had gathered in one place.\n\"Everyone, gather up. Let’s talk.\"\n\"Alright. It’s time for my brilliant brain to go to work.\"\n\"I’ll show you the location of the other invaders on the map. I also have a general idea as to where the Spirit General is. But the problem’s the imperial troops that are coming down to Bayran as we speak.\"\n\"Shin Woo, your mana detection is abnormal.\"\n\"If you’re bitter about it, then get to level 8 too.\"\n\"Keuk.\"\nLee Shin Woo placed four dots on the map. He could identify Arema Steelworker’s magic, so he knew where Anti-Skull and the golem’s forces were.\nBut he was worried about the forces that came from the capital. They were far away, but for some reason, he was familiar with this presence. Their presence was faint, such that if he stopped focusing he felt like he’d lose sight of the presence. Check latest chapters at N0velFire.ɴet\n\"A faint presence...? No way!\"\nRetadane looked at the quickly approaching dot, gritted her teeth and yelled.\n\"Golden Shadow...! Vellun Von Dorthe is coming with the Emperor’s personal intelligence unit!\"\n\"Golden Shadow... I think I’ve heard that somewhere before.\"\n\"It’s an organization that consists of people who are stealthy and quick on their feet. By the Emperor’s command, they wander across the Empire in secret and collect information for him... They’re also famous for eliminating anyone who opposes the Empire without anyone ever knowing.\"\n\"So they’re assassins.\"\nNow he remembered. A long time ago, when Lee Shin Woo was having so much fun ’destroying cities’, the lord had misunderstood and thought he was part of the Golden Shadow. Considering the fact that the Golden Shadow was the Emperor’s personal hit-squad, he could completely understand the lord’s reaction.\n\"But wait a second. Did you say Dorthe?\"\n\"Yes. Vellun Von Dorthe. He’s the Dorthe clan’s firstborn. Their family has a long history of being a ’shadow’ clan. Back then, both brothers were chosen to become a part of the 12 Generals, which was the topic of conversation at the time. That reaction... Did you perhaps...?\"\n\"Yes. I killed his younger brother.\"\n\"Junior. Lately, your personality’s really starting to show in your voice.\"\nThe Golden Shadow General, Vellun Von Dorthe. He was the Lightning Shadow General’s older brother, and apparently, he was more skilled than his younger brother in several ways. Perhaps he could completely assimilate with his shadow.\n\"Shadow, huh...\"\n\"That man’s dangerous. He’s incredibly fast and stealthy. It’s difficult to detect him, even if he’s right in front of you. In a way, he may be more dangerous than the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin. This is troubling. We may be able to take him down if we work together, but if we’re attacked by the other forces, then...\"\n\"I suppose it won’t be such a pleasant experience. Alright. Let’s formulate a plan.\"\n\"What plan?\"\n\"A plan that makes all the forces inside the city fight and destroy each other.\"\nIt really was a Lee Shin Woo-esque thing to say. Kratia and Jin nodded their heads as if expecting him to say that, but Prince and Retadane looked on vacantly.\n\"If that were so easy, then there would be nothing to think about. How would you...?\"\n\"It’s easy. Now that you mention it, this city is filled with traps, monsters, and spirits. If we can figure out how they’re organized, then all we need to do is gradually lead the forces to them.\"\n\"Let’s say you lead the other forces to the traps. What are you going to do about the imperial troops? They know this city inside and out.\"\n\"I’ll just draw them out myself. I can do that much.\"\nLee Shin Woo said confidently, and Retadane was so speechless that she slapped her forehead.\n\"You heard me, right? There’s a chance that the Golden Shadow General is with them. Your abilities are remarkable, but you’ll die if you’re ambushed.\"\n\"You said that that guy could melt into shadows, right?\"\n\"That’s right. He can assimilate with his element, a possessor of a transcendent ability that only a handful of people in the Empire...\"\nRetadane stopped right in the middle. Kratia and Prince were the same. Lee Shin Woo’s hand had also melted into the darkness.\n\"I also possess such a transcendent ability. There’s a chance I won’t be taken out. Please trust me.\"\n\"How can this be...\"\n\"Shin Woo...\"\n\"Junior, where did you even come from? Are you really my Junior?\"\nWhile Kratia and Retadane remained dumbfounded, Prince, with a worried expression, walked over to Lee Shin Woo and pulled his cheek. She’d never pulled his cheek before, so there was no way that she could confirm whether he was the real deal or not. But he was well aware that she was truly concerned for him.\n\"I said I went through a level 7 dungeon. I couldn’t clear it without getting this strong.\"\n\"Mm...\"\n\"Is that all?\"\nRetadane suddenly asked, her eyes tinged with suspicion.\n\"Are you cooperating with someone right now? In other words... Like that undead who told us about the Heaven Defying General.\"\n\"Yes, you’re right.\"\nLee Shin Woo answered nonchalantly and Retadane furrowed her brows.\n\"As I thought... I was suspicious when you said you were coming to Bayran alone, but the fact that they’re not around means that... No, are you trying to be considerate?\"\n\"It’ll be troublesome if both sides were to fight.\"\n\"Hoo. That was the right call. I told you that your decision was right, but I don’t have the confidence to hold myself back in front of them... However, my thought process hasn’t changed. You cannot trust them completely. You’ve acquired power, so I trust that you won’t be taken down by unforeseen circumstances.\"\nRetadane was still the same as always. When he mentioned the Heaven Defying General, Lee Shin Woo was worried that Retadane would enter her ’psycho mode’, but it turned out better than he’d expected. He smiled faintly and tried to convince her once more.\n\"Let’s call it a win-win. No harm will come to us, so long as their goal to kill the Emperor remains the same.\"\n\"...Undead with a clear goal. That’s what makes them so scary.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Nothing. Never mind.\"\nRetadane’s voice quieted down half-way through, and Lee Shin Woo pretended like he couldn’t hear her. Everyone knew how scary the undead were. On the contrary, Lee Shin Woo was perhaps the one who knew best!\n\"If they help us, then you may be able to draw out the imperial troops as well. You drawing them out and forcing them to clash against the Heaven Defying General’s troops is another issue entirely, but... It seems like we have no choice but to try.\"\n\"Huh? No, I’m going to draw them out by myself. I’ll be enough. You guys should do something else in the meantime.\"\n\"Something else...?\"\n\"Beyond this.\"\nLee Shin Woo extended one hand and pointed towards the thorn wall. He circled the location of the giant cannon and the Spirit General and said.\n\"We force them to fight and then we get what they came for. Whether it’s the Anti-Skull or the golems, there’s something that they want here. If we can, we steal it, and if we can’t, then we destroy it. Please take care of that, seniors.\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 44. Bayran Infiltration - 7>\nEven if they followed his instructions, there was still a problem. They hadn’t gotten through the thorn wall yet. That’s why they had stopped here in the first place.\n\"I have an idea.\"\nWhile they were talking amongst themselves, Lee Shin Woo had thought up some ways to get through the thorn wall ’with his party’, but Kratia’s eyes were sparkling, so he decided to hear her out first.\n\"I analyzed the thorn wall and found that the ore would temporarily overlap its defense and durability in the specific area whenever it is attacked, nullifying the damage.\n\"...Hey, wait. That’s ridiculous.\"\nDarkness signified a link. By using this power, the ores were pieced together. The secret behind the thorn wall’s formidable defense lay in gathering ore which possessed similar characteristics, assimilating them together, and overlapping them together. Content orıginally comes from novel fire.net\n\"Now that you mention it... This is indeed the power of darkness. I understand now. A magician’s deductive ability is quite surprising.\"\n\"This is basic for a magician. Prince is still below average.\"\n\"Keuk.\"\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo already knew all this. His peak darkness element mastery wasn’t just for show. If Lee Shin Woo were alone, he could’ve just forced his way through the wall.\n\"Then why is it that level 8 or lower physical attacks can’t damage the wall?\"\n\"You need to think about it in reverse. A level 8’s physical attacks can somewhat ignore the darkness element surrounding the Evil Eye ore. An attack that messes with the wall’s overlapping defense will inflict damage.\"\n\"Ah... As I thought.\"\nLee Shin Woo understood what she meant, as he had gone through several changes when he’d reached level 8. Yeah, that’s right. He hadn’t felt anything unusual, as he could use several elements and had even unlocked a few innate elements as well, but level 8 was a large leap towards a higher realm.\n’I hadn’t realized because everything else I’d gotten was so amazing. But now that I know, it’s fine. Since it’ll make Wild Card, which lets me define myself, better than before.’\nIf he really wanted to, he could unleash a physical attack that defied physics, so Kratia’s deduction was spot on. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and Kratia continued.\n\"I’ve thought of three ways. First, we take advantage of the limitation of the thorn wall’s overlapping defense; we attack in two places at once. One person attacks the same spot, and the other uses that opportunity to unleash a quick and powerful attack on the wall. As long as the overlapping darkness element doesn’t react, then the second attacker should be able to damage a portion of the wall.\"\n\"A good plan.\"\nThe fact that its defensive capabilities were assimilated and overlapped meant that the wall focused all of its defense at one point at a time. It didn’t just take that defense from nowhere.\nIn other words, if one person were to attack one place, forcing the wall to overlap its defenses in that specific area, then another person could attack and damage the wall before the concentration of defense could shift to the new area.\n\"Second, I use my ice. Ice is, at its core, based around death, and change. My magic freezes everything and in the process, can make everything move slower as well. Mana, as well as these ores’ overlapping ability, are no exception. Therefore, if I make the wall respond slower than normal, then we should be able to get through without much difficulty. Of course, it would take an immense amount of mana to do so.\"\n\"Cool.\"\n\"I’m always cool.\"\nHoo. If all the heroes were like Kratia, then they would’ve conquered the Underground Empire already... Lee Shin Woo looked at Kratia as if deeply moved, and experienced Jin’s ’rodeo’. This was quite the bold move for a woman who’d wondered whether she was qualified or not.\n\"Lastly... We use light. I don’t think I even need to explain this.\"\n\"That’s right. After listening to you, I’ve gotten the gist of it.\"\nRetadane agreed as if the answer were obvious. The mace end of her flail was already accumulating a bright white light.\nIt was clear that she had transcended human limitations, as she could create the light element.\n\"Light is the power of severing. It goes without saying that it can sever things that have been connected through the darkness element. But because I cannot even begin to comprehend the concentration of darkness magic that has gathered in this wall... Even I, who can use such powerful light, am not confident that I can break through it by myself.\"\n\"That’s why I told you all the options. We’ll mix all three of them together.\"\nThat was the most effective method. Especially because they were pressed for time. Kratia stretched out three fingers. Seeing that, Retadane nodded her head in understanding.\n\"As expected. Lee Shin Woo will attack the wall first, forcing the wall to concentrate its defenses in a different location. And during that time, you’ll use your ice magic. Then, I’ll use my light magic to its fullest in that area... If we do that, then we should be able to get through the thorn wall.\"\n\"We’ll be able to break through only a portion of it. There’s a chance that it can regenerate.\"\n\"If we can get in, then getting out shouldn’t be too difficult. ...I see. There was indeed a way to break through the thorn wall.\"\nRetadane was deeply moved at the realization that they could combine their power to break through the thorn wall. Many years ago, when she was still young, she remembered seeing the chaotic form of the thorn wall and being unable to do anything but latch on to her older brother...\n\"...Let’s begin. Lee Shin Woo, you have the toughest job. Can we leave it to you?\"\n\"Of course.\"\nIf Lee Shin Woo were to help Retadane with his own light element, they would be able to break through the thorn wall with ease.\nLee Shin Woo didn’t say anything, but the party seemed to think that he was putting in a lot of effort just to wield the Shining Bone Sword. They didn’t even suspect that Lee Shin Woo could masterfully wield the Shining Bone Sword’s light element and cut through the thorn wall alone.\n’Forget the light element. I could use the Shining Flame to outright erase the thorn wall’s karma.’\nLee Shin Woo decided to humor them and stepped forward, gripping the sword with both hands. He didn’t even need to gather his mana. With but a thought, the world’s mana would come to his aid. Plus, there was already a significant amount of mana within the sword itself.\n\"I’m ready. Tell me when you’re all ready.\"\n\"I’m ready as well.\"\n\"Not yet. Just a little while longer... Done.\"\nLee Shin Woo nodded his head and silently thrust his sword. His sword pierced through the wall with ease, as if he were slicing through butter. Since the light element was attached to every one of his attacks, the wall was unable to activate its defensive ability at the moment of impact.\nBut right after, he could feel its incredible toughness. While Lee Shin Woo’s attack possessed transcendent strength, the thorn wall’s own defense was transcendent as well.\n\"Hoo. It’s better than I expected.\"\nDarkness’s ability of assimilation. They had developed this ability into an overlapping ability. He could see the wall gathering all of the Evil Eye ores’ strength into one place so that it could crush the sword.\n’What a tremendous flow. The energy being overlapped into this space could even hurt the Garuda. Even if they’re rotten, they’re still the Empire, huh...!’\nLee Shin Woo saw as the darkness that comprised the wall move around and smiled automatically. There was so much he learned from seeing that. He’d reached the peak of the darkness element, but it didn’t mean he’d mastered every facet of using it. Overlap. What a good idea.\n\"Now!\"\n\"I’m going! Huaaaaahp!\"\nWhile Lee Shin Woo was experiencing the thorn wall’s ability first hand and analyzing it, Kratia had burst a portion of the wall with her ice magic.\nShe cast a small blizzard with her violently rotating orb and temporarily halted the wall’s overlapping function. Then, Retadane’s flail exploded with light. She let out a battle cry and a portion of the wall collapsed!\n\"Shin Woo, you can stop now! We have to go in now!\"\n\"Lee Shin Woo, will you really be ok!?\"\n\"I have someone working with me. On the contrary, I’m more worried about you.\"\n\"That nonchalant expression... Very good. Leave the inside to us!\"\n\"Shin Woo, you have to tell me everything later.\"\n\"Good luck, Junior! If you die, I’ll kill you!\"\nLee Shin Woo watched as his party, aside from him and Jin rushed through the opening, and then withdrew his sword. The area he pulled the sword out of seemed to emit an unbecoming scream and caused an uproar in the entire area.\nAt the same time, darkness thorns were formed in the damaged area, which attempted to punish the intruder, but the moment they touched his body, the thorns completely fell apart.\n\"What do you think you’re doing?\"\n\"It almost seems harder hiding that ability than using it.\"\n\"Still... it’s like I’ve stopped being human.\"\n\"You stopped being human a while ago.\"\nOnce the party was gone, Jin spoke. Lee Shin Woo just grinned and replied. And he picked up the remains of the thorn wall.\nIts name was indeed ’Evil Eye’. Each piece was only a level 6 piece of ore, so he couldn’t believe that altogether it formed such a tremendous artifact.\n\"So the more pieces that are gathered, the more powerful it gets. But instead of overlapping the properties in emergencies only, why not overlap matter itself?\"\n\"What a crazy idea! What happened to the conversation of mass!?\"\n\"When I first came here, he [1] died, along with my body.\"\nLee Shin Woo tried to apply the technique he’d just learned with his own darkness magic, applying it to the thorn wall’s debris.\nHe thought it’d be really tough to do, but he was able to condense the debris into the size of a bean with ease, perhaps because he, who’d mastered the darkness element, had seen the ability first hand and understood its fundamental principles.\n\"Aha. So this is the real way of using this ore. You don’t overlap the magic together, you overlap the matter itself together instead. You’re not supposed to make this stupid wall with it.\"\n\"...\"\nOf course, in the process of overlapping matter, it became heavier as well, but it was still lighter than combining the weight of all the debris. The conservation truly was dead.\nWhat was so special about this ability? Well, if he were to gather all the Evil Eye in one place, then he would be able to create the world’s heaviest and most durable artifact with the highest magic concentration.\n\"Does the Undead Emperor know this too? I’m excited.\"\n\"So are you going to break this whole thing down...?\"\n\"Are you crazy? This thing will become the last bastion that stops the others from entering. I’ll do it after it’s done its job.\"\nHe wondered what he would have to do if the hole wasn’t mended, but it had completely regenerated, though he didn’t know where the additional material had come from. He tapped on the once collapsed area and found that it was as tough as ever.\n\"Good. Then we’re all good to go.\"\nLee Shin Woo placed the level 6 (+7) Evil Eye bean into his chest, grinned and turned around. The Chi Pauls had already lined up in front of him. Including the original Chi Paul, there were five level 7 elites. They feared nothing.\n[You called for us, so we came. What shall we do?]\n\"What do you mean? We do we what we do best.\"\nLee Shin Woo checked the location of all the forces one last time. He’d already memorized where all the traps were, as well as where the monsters and spirits were.\n\"Our goal is to confuse our enemies, cause them to lose their way, cause them to fight against each other, and lose sight of their goals and themselves... Basically, just make a mess of things. Today, we’re killing four of the 12 Generals!\"\n[Understood!]\nChi Paul yelled vigorously. The others needed no explanation. When Lee Shin Woo had completely mastered the darkness element, he had become able to directly transmit his thoughts to his subordinates.\nHis subordinates went everywhere. It was time to raise the curtains for the Heaven Defying General’s performance.\n[1] T/N: Refers to the conservation of mass as a ’he’.",

    "content": "<Chapter 45. Heaven Defying General’s Stage - 1>\nLee Shin Woo first followed the golems’ presence. If he wanted everything to go as planned, then he’d need to make contact with them first.\nHe and his party had run through the city without stopping, and he’d roughly recorded info on the city, which made it easier to use his Wild Card skill. Lee Shin Woo and Jin, who melted into the city’s darkness, resembled shadows as they ran with such speed and secrecy.\nBut Jin, who was running at full speed, wasn’t feeling very good.\n\"I know it’s assimilation, but it’s strange because it feels like I’m stuck to the ground...\"\n\"We have no choice. Your light-speed sprint is way too conspicuous.\" ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ NovєlFіre.net\n\"Ugh. Damn it.\"\nThey quickly found their objective. Lee Shin Woo and Jin had met him a few times before; the elite level 7 golem, Guillotine Steelworker, was leading many level 6 golems in breaking through the traps. They were blazing a trail through the minefield so to speak, using their bodies as a sacrifice.\n[Be strong. We’re slowly getting closer to our destination.]\n[Yes, sir!]\n[Some of the traps we haven’t set off keep summoning spirits and monsters... Huh!? Who is it!?]\nLee Shin Woo and Jin hid within the building’s side post, but when the time was right, he released his Assimilation with the darkness and came forward.\nGuillotine, who hadn’t been able to sense him before he exposed himself, was shocked and pointed his spear at him. A level 7 elite just wasn’t enough to threaten him anymore.\n\"What did you come here for, Golem?\"\n[Y-You are...!?]\nGuillotine glared at him. Did he recall Lee Shin Woo’s black armor (while hiding within the shadows, Lee Shin Woo’s armor was replaced with the element) and the imposing horse he was riding? He exerted even more pressure into the spear.\n[Paul Zero, were you the Heaven Defying General...?]\n\"A lot of you called me that.\"\nLee Shin Woo confidently nodded his head. He’d introduced himself as Paul Zero in front of Arema Steelworker and Guillotine in the past, but they wouldn’t think that he was the same undead as before. After all, his growth rate was astounding, even to him.\n[You’ve finally shown your true colors...! There was a lot I wanted to ask you. To think you’d use your subordinate to spy on us and expose us to the imperial army!]\n\"Oh.\"\nLee Shin Woo briefly looked through his memories and as though he’d remembered, soon replied in a sluggish voice.\n\"Now that you mention it, that did happen. Yeah, it did. I ordered my subordinate to do that. So how about it? Did you get into contact with Anti-Skull after that? Considering how they’re here too, it seems like you’ve gotten quite friendly with each other.\"\n[You bastard...!]\nThat’s right. In the past, before he’d fought against the Lightning Shadow General, Hansen Von Dorthe, he’d first impersonated Kadinan’s (satellite city) lord, Nellopa, and had sent a false report that ’The Golden General, Arema Steelworker and Seagald Von Retadane’s Anti-Skull had joined forces and were attacking the city’.\nFollowing that event, the imperial army became wary of both Arema Steelworker and Anti-Skull, forcing the golems and Anti-Skull out of hiding. It seemed like Guillotine was under the impression that Lee Shin Woo had ordered a subordinate to carry out his plan under his name, but unfortunately, Lee Shin Woo had executed the plan himself.\n[Who do you work for? How can you, a mere undead, do such a thing!?]\n\"I’m sick of questions like that. I don’t work for anyone. I just do what I want. Unlike you guys, who’re just the Magic Emperor’s faithful hunting dogs.\"\n[...!]\n\"So how long do I have to wait here before Arema Steelworker arrives? If you want to keep me here, then say something more exciting.\"\nGuillotine Steelworker was speechless. Lee Shin Woo was exaggerating a yawn, and Guillotine kept opening and closing his mouth, but he eventually managed to say something.\n[You. Did you know from the very beginning...? What are you planning!?]\n\"Planning? Don’t say something so sad. I just don’t want to lose your forces for nothing. You’ve already expended some of your forces getting through these traps. A good general values his soldiers’ lives. Am I wrong?\"\n’How are you so good at cutting down a person’s self-confidence?’\n’Hey, the way you said ’so good’ sounded a bit weird?’\nWhile Lee Shin Woo and Jin communicated via telepathy, Guillotine’s body shook. ’A golem can shake when they become level 7?’, Lee Shin Woo asked, only to notice Guillotine’s shaking starting to intensify. Lee Shin Woo was shocked.\n[You’ll regret it...! Our Lord will soon be here with the remainder of the Four Heavenly Commanders. I know how strong you are, but we’ll see how relaxed you are after they come...!]\n\"Oh man, I’m so scared. No matter how strong I am, I have no plans on fighting the level 8 Golden General.\"\n[Do you want to talk? It’s already too late. By becoming an undead, it seems that in exchange for your strength, your brain’s rotted away. It’s too late to feel regret...]\n[Guillotine, are you alright?]\n[My lord!]\nIn the midst of Lee Shin Woo playing around with Guillotine, several golems rushed onto the premises, accompanied by powerful energy being shot towards Lee Shin Woo.\nWhile its power was significantly reduced due to the countless traps nearby, it was still a concentrated blast of a level 8’s mana, so it was enough to cause Lee Shin Woo to worry.\n[...A shield?]\nBut the energy he’d shot out (it was probably metal element mana) was blocked by a shield that came out of nowhere, causing it to vanish.\n\"Did you really think I wouldn’t be prepared when I’ve come all this way to meet the Golden General?\"\n[Ugh...]\nThe shield was the level 7 Titan’s Fortress and was one of the 17 weapons that Lee Shin Woo had summoned and fully charged.\nSeeing that, Arema Steelworker was shocked. Lee Shin Woo saw him take a step back and nodded his head. With just one move, Arema Steelworker had realized that Lee Shin Woo was level 8. Though Lee Shin Woo could perform such a move when he was level 7 as well!\n[The Heaven Defying General... I have heard of you. A hidden dragon that appeared just recently. I didn’t think we’d meet like this.]\n\"I’ve met you once before. Don’t you remember?\"\n[You mean that subordinate of yours. He had potential. I see that he takes after his master in terms of guts and talent.]\nEven if he told him that he was Paul Zero, it was unlikely that Arema Steelworker would believe him. Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and decided to make the first move.\n\"So why are you here? Is this what the Magic Emperor wants?\"\n[So you know. You must have come from the surface as well.]\nLee Shin Woo could feel an invisible pressure tightening around him on all sides.\nWhen one becomes level 8, they gain the ability to influence the mana around them and control it; a type of authority. Perhaps because it originated from a golem, the ambient mana took on a metallic property that smelled of blood.\nIt seemed to be a derivative of the earth element, much like the wood element, but it seemed more independent from the source... perhaps it was a specialized element that could only be obtained when one becomes a golem.\nWhen he had last felt Arema Steelworker’s strength, he had tried his best to act unfazed, but now, he wasn’t the least bit affected.\nHe could match that pressure... No, he could go even further beyond it. To him, he saw Arema Steelworker’s action as just a waste of mana.\n[I don’t know how much you know... or who you’re working for. But what I am sure of is that you’re a threat to my master. You wanted something, so you came all the way here, but... It’s quite unfortunate. I’ll kill you where you stand.]\nArema Steelworker gathered a tremendous amount of energy into his fist. According to his calculations, Arema Steelworker was using the metal element mana to temporarily increase his durability and reinforce himself as well. It was as though he was making his body into the most powerful weapon.\nThe Four Heavenly Commanders behind him exerted incredible strength as well. At this rate, he would have to fight against them. Since he really didn’t want to fight them, he quickly took out the ’Anti-Arema Steelworker’ weapon he’d brought from the surface.\n[!?]\nAt that moment, Arema Steelworker sounded as though he’d caught a bug of some sort and stood still. The tremendous mana that he’d gathered was released and gently disappeared amongst the mass of golems.\nThe other golems were the same. They rubbed their eyes, as if they couldn’t believe what was happening, blinked, or even tapped their heads to confirm that what was happening was real. However, it didn’t change anything.\n[T-That...]\nArema Steelworker’s voice quivered. The Golden General that had been so imposing when they’d first met was no longer here.\nHe was acting like a cowardly middle-schooler who had just been caught writing a poem at the corner of their notes about their first love!\n[That... How... How do you have that? How the hell do you have that!?]\n\"I wonder. Why don’t you use your brain? If not... Then why don’t we ask the servants of the Steelworker family?\"\n[You bastard, Paul Zero...! Paul Zero...!]\n\"Ah, that’s right.\"\nLee Shin Woo sounded regretful as if he’d just remembered something.\n\"If you return to the surface like that, your servants might run away in fear. Isn’t that right?\"\n[You bastard... You bastard...! I’ll kill you. I’ll kill you!]\n\"Go ahead and try.\"\nArema Steelworker’s body shook and then went ’thud’. He took a step forward and raised his hand, but Lee Shin Woo extended the ’ultimate weapon’ and he stopped once more. This was so fun.\n[Why is the lord... Why? How?]\n\"Ah, I have yours too, so don’t feel left out. Yours were broken up, but the security was all the same. It wasn’t such a good idea to record it in the golem network, now was it?\"\n[The information hidden on the golem network is only accessible by myself and His Majesty...! There’s absolutely no way that an outsider can access it!]\n\"Ta-dah! There’s no such thing as an ’absolute’ in this world!\"\nLee Shin Woo smiled sweetly. Whenever he used the ultimate weapon, Arema Steelworker would flinch.\nIf he could, he would play around a little bit longer, but even now, Anti-Skull and the imperial army were coming to the city. He needed to negotiate with them if he wanted the time that Chi Paul and his forces had bought him to not go to waste.\n\"Now, Golden General. Are you willing to hear me out now?\"\n[You... I want to kill you, but...!]\nHis words (that of a level 8 golem) were so frightening that it almost seemed like he would be cursed, but Lee Shin Woo didn’t pay it any mind. Soon, he heard exactly what he wanted to hear.\n[I’ll hear... what you have to say...!]\n\"Hoo. We can finally talk. What a joyous occasion.\"\n[But promise me that you’ll give it back...! Me and my subordinates precious ’bodies’...!]\n\"Oh, but of course. If you do exactly as I say, that is.\"\nLee Shin Woo sounded so sure of himself that only Jin could think that ’Ah, this asshole’s lying again...!’. He replied and shook Arema Steelworker’s level 8 human body.\nThat’s right. When Arema Steelworker had left the surface and had placed himself into a golem, he had left his physical body in his family’s safe house, so that he could one day return to his original body. ...And once he’d figured that out, Lee Shin Woo had snatched their bodies in order to use them as his ’ultimate weapon’ against them!",

    "content": "<Chapter 45. Heaven Defying General’s Stage - 2>\n[We’ve exchanged communications with Anti-Skull a few times. We’ve also forged a temporary alliance as well.]\n\"What do you know about its leader?\"\n[...Not much. But I do know that he disagrees with Jissehanu.]\nJissehanu. That was the first time he’d heard that name from someone other than the Goddess when she’d first summoned and explained the situation to him.\nHe was not only the Undead Empire’s Emperor but was also the 2nd prince that was exiled from the surface. Jissehanu had immersed himself in research, in an attempt to one day return to the surface, but... was consequently the very person that had trapped all of his people underground.\n[He was against Jissehanu’s research from the very beginning. It was the first time he, the Emperor’s sword, had disobeyed him. And he ultimately created a separate organization without the Emperor’s knowledge... To this day, I’m not entirely sure what his true intentions are.]\n\"But you’re working together for now because you both oppose the Undead Emperor.\"\n[That’s right. ...And because he’s undead. He wouldn’t be able to change anything by himself. No matter what his intentions were.]\nArema Steelworker said as he gazed at Lee Shin Woo. His eyes seemed to ask ’But how is it that you’re doing this, and are you truly undead?’. Lee Shin Woo just ignored his questioning gaze and asked.\n\"Then why did you come to Bayran with them all of a sudden? What made you come here, knowing that you’d provoke the imperial army and meet with human beings that are still living and breathing?\"\n[That’s...]\n\"That’s?\"\nLee Shin Woo tilted his head and shook Arema Steelworker’s body (the soulless one). Seeing that, Arema Steelworker responded post haste.\n[There’s a magical weapon at the center of Bayran that was built to destroy the barrier! We were planning on using that to strike the Undead Emperor!]\n\"Aha!\"\nHe’d solved the puzzle! This city was supposedly built for spirits and they had even brought in the Spirit General (princess) to help; ultimately, this was another one of the Emperor’s experiments that would allow him to go outside!\n[The Spirit General, Dana Von Etliber is the possessor of a powerful authority that compels spirits to follow her. In the past, the Emperor hypothesized that they would be able to destroy the barrier by using her power to accumulate all of the spirits’ power in one place. Bayran was constructed so that she could use her power to its fullest.]\nImpressive. Whether it be the Magic Empire or the Underground Empire, neither of them really cared about the spirits! The 2nd prince merely cooperated with the spirits, as their positions were the same, but they’d never gone out of their way to help them!\n\"So they tricked them. They drew them to the city, telling them that they were creating a paradise for spirits when they were actually using them as a power source for a barrier-breaking weapon.\"\n[That’s right. It was impossible for the Princess to do alone, but combined with the Emperor’s obsession and highly advanced magic engineering, they almost brought it to fruition. This city was brought about through magic engineering. Though it’s still a bit behind the surface’s...]\nThe Dryads had implored him to meet with Dana Von Etliber, foolishly believing that meeting her would solve everything when...\n’If so...’\nLee Shin Woo sported a crooked smile. Of course, he really wasn’t blaming the Undead Emperor. On the contrary, he actually wanted to applaud him for doing everything he could to return to the surface.\nBut it was funny. That all that hard work had been for nothing. That the weapon that the Emperor had created to escape was being used against him.\n\"So you’re going to aim that cannon at the capital and fire it.\"\n[Paul Zero. You should feel it too. That magical tool’s power is no joke; it’s been untouched, accumulating energy for dozens of years. If it hits the capital, then even the Emperor won’t remain unscathed. It seems like Jissehanu realized this too, seeing as how he sent one of the 12 Generals, but it’s already too late. He won’t be able to stop it.]\n\"Hmm, as I thought... You plan on taking on the Undead Emperor directly.\"\n[Who do you think... is to blame for that...!?]\nThat’s right. It was all Lee Shin Woo’s fault! Originally, Arema Steelworker was only ordered to watch the Underground Empire. Because the undead weren’t capable of change and had no means of coming to the surface, all he had to do was watch them. At least, that’s all he should’ve had to do.\n[But you made them ’aware’ of our existence...! They’ve begun obsessing over us! We had no choice but to come out of hiding, if for no other reason than to protect the location of our base...!]\nTo think that his tactic, which he hadn’t put much thought into, had been this effective! Lee Shin Woo realized that this chain of events was truly his fault and couldn’t help but marvel at what he had done.\n’I didn’t completely understand the undead at the time, so... I didn’t want to be the only one who took the fall and just wanted to make a mess of things.’\nAt this point, Lee Shin Woo started to make some assumptions, but the undead were indeed entities that acted in order to maintain the status quo. The Undead Emperor, Jissehanu, as well as the undead in the capital likely followed this principle.\nIn other words, they were acting in order to preserve the Emperor’s authority. Thus, they had designated Arema Steelworker and his golems as a high level threat and looked into them, as they had killed the Lightning Shadow General (even though it was Lee Shin Woo) and had cleared out the secret production facility (also Lee Shin Woo).\nAt this rate, their base would eventually be discovered, so Arema Steelworker decided that they would risk fighting head-on in order to keep the location and the existence of their base a secret. So, they had forged an alliance with Anti-Skull and had begun to move.\n\"Then what about the humans?\"\n[The humans... The heroes will divert Jissehanu’s attention from us.]\n\"As expected. Good insight. But you could’ve joined forces with them too.\"\n[They’d be expendable. I’ve seen Seira Von Retadane before, but I was disappointed. Yes, she can use the light element. But she can’t overcome the Emperor, let alone the Archmage. The magicians were promising, but once they reach the capital’s stronghold, they would need at least dozens of years to get through.]\nExpendable, huh. It was easy to understand. Lee Shin Woo inwardly smiled bitterly. He felt the exact same way about the golems!\nAfter that, Lee Shin Woo asked a few more questions regarding their position and the current situation. Once he’d gathered enough information, Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and wrapped everything up by clapping his hands.\n\"Now that we know enough about each other, let’s work together to reach our goal.\"\n[You won’t even show your face. How impudent!]\n\"Let’s join up with Anti-Skull, shall we? If our goal of killing the Emperor aligns, then we could form a good relationship with them.\"\n[Do you really think that man will trust you?]\nLee Shin Woo just ignored him and formulated a plan. In response, Arema Steelworker retorted. It had been a while since the Metal General’s overwhelming pressure had disappeared. Lee Shin Woo just shrugged his shoulders and said.\n\"If it turns south, then I’ll just have to rely on the Metal General’s strength, now won’t I?\"\n[You bastard...!]\nIf he managed to recruit the Metal General and Anti-Skull and attack the Emperor together, then he wouldn’t need to do anything more.\nHe would make the three forces destroy each other, and in the aftermath, the Heaven Defying General’s troops could clean up what remained. If he were to then kill the Magic Emperor after that, in tandem with the heroes, then that would be ideal... Of course, Lee Shin Woo was sure that things wouldn’t go so smoothly.\n’I need to get rid of the heroes’ deep-seated hatred of the undead...’\nHe turned his gaze towards the frontrunner of that hatred, Seira Von Retadane, who was heading towards the center of the city and sighed.\nShe would personally confront the Metal General or the Annihilation Flame Sword God if she were to see them, so he’d sent the heroes inside, but even now, he wondered whether that was the right call or not.\n’SSeup. It can’t be helped. Whether it’s the Metal General, the Golden Shadow General, or the Annihilation Flame General, it’ll be fine as long as I handle them. They should be able to take on the Spirit General, who’s been stuck here for dozens of years. ...But why do I feel uneasy now that I’ve thought that?’\nLee Shin Woo, who’d secured the allegiance of the Metal General, followed the traces of Anti-Skull, which had entered the city. In the process, he spoke to Chi Paul through telepathy and ordered them to hold the imperial troops back.\n[Lord Paul Zero. Please tell me one thing. If we have to fight against Arema Steelworker, could you give me the honor of killing him myself?]\n[I promise. When the time comes, I’ll leave it to you.]\n[Thank you very much.]\nHearing that, the Chi Pauls moved more quickly than before, as if they’d self-buffed themselves through their revenge. As ordered, the Chi Pauls activated the traps here and there, and led the imperial troops into them. This would slow the imperial army down, no matter how secretly they were moving!\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo hadn’t made that promise willy-nilly. He was hoping that Chi Paul would come out stronger than before after killing the one who’d made him like this, like Shino Rendu when he’d absorbed the Mercenary King’s bone.\n’If all goes well, then he may reach level 8 before Shino Rendu... No, more importantly.’\nLee Shin Woo sensed a familiar mana reaction and nodded his head. He was sure of it. It was Anti-Skull. Despite them being harassed by the Chi Pauls just a short while ago, their troops were as imposing as ever. Moreover, he sensed several level 7s in the middle of their force!\n\"As I thought, he has enough power to take on the Emperor alone.\"\n[When the Retadane family was banished, their power was second only to Jissehanu and are likewise descendants of the royal family.]\nArema Steelworker said nonchalantly. How kind! He would definitely keep him around a little more before Chi Paul killed him.\n\"Arema.\"\n[Keuk.]\nLee Shin Woo gave a brief and concise order. Arema Steelworker gritted his teeth, stepped forward, and revealed himself. Anti-Skull, which had split up into several groups, stiffened right then and there.\n[Metal General!]\nAt the center, a knight exerting the most pressure amongst them stepped forward. He was garbed in a full suite of plate armor, but the goblin fire that seeped through his visor proved that he was an undead. But he wasn’t Seagald Von Retadane. He was a level 7 elite, Tarian Von Retadane.\n[Let’s group up. There’s been a problem that I have to explain to you guys.]\n[A problem...? Wait a sec, is that man...?]\nLee Shin Woo belatedly stepped forward. Tarian was shocked upon realizing who he was. Lee Shin Woo softly raised one hand and introduced himself.\n\"I’m Paul Zero. I wanted to thank you on behalf of my subordinates.\"\n[The Heaven Defying General...!]\nAlthough he’d introduced himself amicably, Tarian remained shocked. No, he was actually exerting a significant amount of pressure...\n[Enough. They’ll be of great help to me and your Anti-Skull!]\n[Metal General... Are you sure?]\nIt was momentarily silent. A short while later, he slowly nodded his head.\n[Alright. We don’t have time. I suppose we have to take all the help we can get, even if it means getting help from the devil himself.]\n\"Hoo. Good thinking.\"\nLee Shin Woo narrowed his eyes (he was in his skeleton form, so he didn’t have eyes) and smiled. For a moment, Tarian hadn’t controlled himself and had let his killing intent slip out, but... there was no way Lee Shin Woo would let that go unnoticed.\n’Does he hate me for stealing his subordinates? No, that wouldn’t be enough to...’ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ novel~fire~net\nIf Anti-Skull were truly an organization devoted to killing the Emperor, then there was no reason for them to kill him, the Heaven Defying General, especially because he could help them. Since Lee Shin Woo had only done things that would be harmful to the Emperor as the Heaven Defying General.\nThem becoming undead and going crazy didn’t fit either... Since that wouldn’t explain their actions thus far.\n’There’s something more important here that I’m not getting. To Anti-Skull, to Seagald Von Retadane...’\nWhat if Anti-Skull’s objective... wasn’t killing the Emperor?\nLee Shin Woo organized his thoughts and his lips twitched. Unfortunately for them, only Lee Shin Woo had the ability to sense their hidden feelings.",

    "content": "<Chapter 45. Heaven Defying General’s Stage - 3>\n[The Golden Shadow General... He has quite the troublesome ability.]\n[But his bones will be buried in this city today.]\n\"I don’t really like that expression... You gotta eat all the way down to the bone too.\"\n[...You.]\nThe pressure exerted by Tarian Von Retadane’s Anti-Skull force (there were three level 7 elites including him, fifteen level 6 elites, and 500 normal level 6s) and Arema Steelworker’s Metal Army (which consisted of the Four Heavenly Commanders (level 7 elites) and 200 level 6 elite golems).\nBut Lee Shin Woo was all alone. He was, of course, with the level 8 Jin, but to everyone else, Jin just looked like a strong warhorse. Arema Steelworker then asked.\n[What about your subordinates?]\n\"They’re doing their own thing. They’re keeping the Golden Shadow General busy.\"\n[What...!?]\nLee Shin Woo had only brought along his Chi Paul squad, which only consisted of 31 Chi Pauls.\nHowever, there were five level 7 elites among them, and the rest were level 6 elites at the cusp of level 7, so his force was no pushover. Lee Shin Woo spoke so nonchalantly that both Anti-Skull and the Metal Army felt tense.\n\"We’re all on the same side now, right? Don’t be so tense. My boys won’t be able to stop the Golden Shadow General on their own... So, that’s why I’m asking for your help.\"\n[...That’s true. As expected of the Heaven Defying General.]\nUnlike his reply, his expression indicated no signs of understanding. In the midst of the heavy silence, the two forces exchanged glances. Lee Shin Woo had forced Anti-Skull and the Metal Army into an uneasy alliance, so there was no way they’d be pleased.\n’So long as I possess the golems’ bodies, there’s no way they’ll attack me first. But, Anti-Skull doesn’t know that yet...’\nHe didn’t know why, but for some reason, Anti-Skull was hostile towards him, and he didn’t want this situation to drag on forever. Tarian would probably try to consult with Arema when Lee Shin Woo wasn’t looking, and if he fails (he would obviously fail), there was a chance that their alliance would break apart.\n’If there’s no way of bringing Anti-Skull over to my side, then it wouldn’t be such a bad idea to make them fight against the golems.’\nAlthough he was working together with them, Lee Shin Woo’s brain was still busy. He also couldn’t keep the golems on his side forever. Before they tried something in an attempt to regain their bodies from him, he would need to find the right time to kill them...\n’How could I take care of them without them noticing?’, Lee Shin Woo wondered, and then asked Tarian Von Retadane, who hadn’t been able to fully conceal his killing intent.\n\"The Annihilation Flame Sword God isn’t with you?\"\n[He didn’t come. He had something more important to do.]\n\"This is an important assignment.\"\n[As his representative, my abilities and position are sufficient.]\n\"Sufficient abilities and position, huh.\"\nHe probably wasn’t wrong. Although Tarian Von Retadane couldn’t match Arema Steelworker, he was definitely stronger than Arema’s Four Heavenly Commanders.\nBut unlike Arema, who personally led his Metal Army, Anti-Skull’s leader hadn’t come, which felt a bit off... Lee Shin Woo directed his questioning gaze at Guillotine, and Guillotine just shrugged his shoulders. Googlᴇ search novel⚑fire.net\n[We’ll ask them later. But the alliance isn’t as solid as you’d think.]\n\"Hmm.\"\nIt seemed as though Anti-Skull wasn’t the only one with trust issues. He wondered. It could be the truth, but... Perhaps the golems were dissatisfied with Lee Shin Woo, as he held the noose around their necks, and were just hiding their true feelings.\n’I feel like it’ll be fine, no matter how the situation turns, but... I suppose I should send Kratia a message first.’\nOnce he’d simply explained the situation to her, he looked over the Anti-Skull squad once more. Unlike the undead he’d awakened, the Anti-Skull’s undead emitted a familiar type of mana. Lee Shin Woo wondered what it was but soon found the answer.\n’It’s light.’\nThat’s right. Although Anti-Skull had experimented with a variety of poisons, he sensed traces of the light element from their mana. Of course, they couldn’t use the light element on their own, they just gave off the feeling that they’d somehow copied the light element.\n’It makes sense. After all, if you have the light element, the element that represents life, then you should be able to fight back against the undead curse. Perhaps these guys have retained their intellect, and they’re no longer ordinary undead due to the light element’s severing effect.’\nAs always, it was just his delusions at work and he didn’t have any proof, but it made sense. However, he still had his doubts. If those countless tests to resist the undead curse were an attempt to obtain the light element, then who the hell was Seagald Von Retadane, the one in charge of those tests?\n’There are plenty of clues.’\nSeira Von Retadane, who could use the light element. The royal family, with power that matched Jissehanu’s at the time of their exile and was also the origin of the Retadane family. It was likely that the Retadane family studied the light element.\nSeira Von Retadane and Seagald Von Retadane were likely born with the ability to wield light, and that’s why Seagald was capable of executing such a grandiose plan.\n’Like my affinity with the darkness element...’\nHe could easily understand why Seira Von Retadane became the first hero, and why Pleine was chosen as God’s apostle. It was because their family was born with the light element!\nLineage was everything. After all, the Golden Shadow General was the firstborn of a family that could control shadows.\n’However, that’s where things differ... How you use what you have and how you develop it. And this guy... No matter how I think of it, he failed.’\nAt some point, Lee Shin Woo discovered thin black threads secretly traveling across the ground and the nearby buildings. The mana threads were created from the buildings’ and peoples’ shadows.\nHe thought he had hidden himself, but it was a pitiful attempt to Lee Shin Woo, who could use Dark Shadow. It might work if the Golden Shadow were fighting against those weaker than him, but how would his technique fare against Lee Shin Woo...?\n[Stop!]\nWhen Lee Shin Woo was about to secretly extend his sword and slice the shadow, Arema, who was standing at the forefront, discovered the traces and stiffly ordered his troops to stop. Unlike the others, Jin, who had been walking slowly to match their pace, stopped with ease.\n[He’s nearby. Golden Shadow! A tough battle awaits us. The nearby roads and buildings have been turned inside out...!]\n[Is it the Golden Shadow General’s barrier!?]\nRight when the group flinched and stopped, Chi Paul reported through telepathy. The Golden Shadow had been caught in the traps, but ultimately, the Golden Shadow General joined the battle. Although three of the Chi Pauls, including one level 7 elite, had sustained critical injuries and were forced to retire, the rest of his forces were able to retreat safely.\nHe was a level 8 capable of controlling shadows and was also a part of the 12 Generals, yet none of them had died. As he thought, their anger towards Arema Steelworker was increasing their abilities by a ’level’ or perhaps even more.\n[Tell the injured to return. Pick out only those who can still fight and wait at the place I designate. If all goes well, you may be able to fight against Anti-Skull as well.]\n[Understood!]\n[Everyone, get ready for battle. He’ll likely ambush us. Focus!]\nLee Shin Woo saw the Metal Army and Anti-Skull prepare for battle and summoned his own weapons. It was the jet-black Giant Drake Horn Lance that he’d infused darkness mana into prior! Arema Steelworker and Tarian Von Retadane flinched at the sight of it.\n[Where did you get...?]\n[...Darkness? It is darkness!]\nLee Shin Woo had fully charged his seventeen weapons with mana, but only nine of them had been floating in the air. The other eight had been hiding in the shadows, but he’d chosen to extract them. He wasn’t really trying to show off, but it was kind of laughable that a level 8 golem was flinching.\n\"Is this the first time you’ve seen a lance?\"\n[If you can wield darkness so easily, then even if you were to fight alone... He’s coming!]\nSuddenly, the shadow underneath them spread out and covered the entire area! It seemed as though it would dye the entire world black. Arema Steelworker gritted his teeth, gathered his own mana, and fought back against the darkness. However, he was only able to protect a portion of his golems. Most of them had been trapped within the darkness.\n[Vellun Von Dorthe...!]\n[Arema Steelworker. You finally show your true colors. To think you’d so fearlessly step foot into one of His Majesty’s cities. I’m happy that I’ll be able to bury you here.]\nA gloomy man’s voice resounded throughout the darkness. Although they were both level 8s, it seemed as though the Golden Shadow General’s command over his element overpowered Arema’s. Arema instantly gathered his mana and fired it within the darkness. However, the darkness merely dispersed for a short time and soon filled the air once more.\n[You really think you can fill the entire world with darkness?]\n[The Underground Empire is governed by darkness. Your metal element is merely unusual. That’s all!]\n[Come on. I’ll show you the true strength of that unusual power of mine...!]\nIt felt like they’d come to blows at any time. But surprisingly, the Golden Shadow General didn’t strike. Rather than challenging Arema Steelworker’s golden mana, the Golden Shadow General safely hid within the darkness and then ambushed one of the Four Heavenly Commanders.\n[Keoheok!]\n[Stake!]\nIt was the right call. Since Stake hadn’t been able to mount a proper defense and was completely destroyed. It made sense. After all, it was the surprise attack of a level 8 and one of the 12 Generals. Even Lee Shin Woo had briefly lost track of his movements.\n’His stats are geared towards Agility and Magic. It’s a classic strategy. He relies on magic, rather than physical strength to hurt his enemies.’\nStake Steelworker’s death signaled the start of the battle. The Golden Shadow General’s forces attacked all at once.\nHis forces hid within the darkness he’d created and continually appeared and disappeared in different areas. They then grouped up and attacked, looking like a wave of darkness.\n’As I thought, using shadows was a specialized form of darkness.\nBut Lee Shin Woo could see them clearly, as he’d reached peak darkness mastery. If he mixed his darkness within theirs, then he could quickly defeat their entire force, but because he knew that Anti-Skull was hiding something, Lee Shin Woo decided to not do more than what was necessary.\n’They act like they’re so powerful, but the technique doesn’t feel invincible... Heup!’\n[Kuhaahk!?]\n[Guaah!]\nLee Shin Woo swung his lance strangely. The approaching wave lost its cutting edge and collapsed instantaneously. The Golden Shadow, which had been pointing their weapons at Lee Shin Woo, were flung out. He squashed a portion of them with his lance and challenged the Golden Shadow General.\n\"You’ve just lost your subordinates. You just going to sit there?\"\n[Keuk. You rat. Let’s see how long you can avoid me!]\nLee Shin Woo had just grinned at the face of Stake Steelworker’s death and fought off the Golden Shadow with ease. Arema Steelworker was enraged at the sight, spread out his mana, and began to chase after the Golden Shadow General. Tarian Von Retadane’s Anti-Skull force was likewise struggling against the Golden Shadow.\n’Let’s see. I wonder what Anti-Skull’s hidden objective is...’\nIf Rem was with him, then he’d be able to more easily observe their movements. Unfortunately, it wasn’t with him right now. But now that it’d come to this, there was no helping it. He had no choice but to use his last resort: ’asking the bones themselves’.\n’All of you, attack Tarian. That’s right. So that I can easily kill him unnoticed... Just a little more. You can do it, Golden Shadow!’\nLee Shin Woo licked his lips and his lance slowly melted into the darkness. The Golden Shadow General probably had no idea that the darkness he’d created was being used by someone else.",

While the Metal Army and Anti-Skull fought against the Golden Shadow, Arema Steelworker played a game of hide-and-seek with the Golden Shadow General, Vellun Von Dorthe. Their mana mixed together messily and continuously exploded.\nThe two level 8s were so imposing that some of their troops were unable to maintain their balance and fell to the floor. However, the situation was so urgent that they had no time to worry about them.\n[He’s gone that way!]\n[Damn it, block...

They truly were the Emperor’s personal assassination squad. If the Metal Army or Anti-Skull were to have faced them alone, it would’ve been twice as hard to fight them off.\n’Plus, the Golden Shadow General’s ability works well in several situations.’\nIf his shadow expanded and covered the entire area it then starts obscuring the line between friend and foe. But the Golden Shadow troops, which were used to said phenomenon, could move with ease and execute their foes. However, their enemies were a different story.\nThey would either attack incorrectly and harm their allies, or they would evade an attack but their movements would overlap with another, causing them to both expose weak points. The confusion was quite entertaining. On the other hand, the Chi Pauls were doing just fine against the Golden Shadow, so much so that Lee Shin Woo was shocked.\n’The key to this battle is the Golden Shadow General. And if we kill him, then we need someone who can keep up with Arema Steelworker.’\nIf Seagald Von Retadane had been here, then the battle would be progressing a lot differently. Unfortunately, his representative, Tarian Von Retadane was slightly lacking in terms of ability.\nNo, he looked like he was holding back. He was only focused on protecting his allies from harm and wasn’t actively trying to fight back...\n’There’s a limit to how suspicious you can be.’\nLee Shin Woo had been quiet watching Tarian and smiled, dumbfounded. He was delaying on purpose. He was trying to extend the battle as long as possible while keeping Anti-Skull’s casualties at a bare minimum.\nWhat was more hilarious was... he must think that no one had noticed, but he was looking at Lee Shin Woo and trying to find a weak spot. He knew that Tarian couldn’t conceal his killing intent, but he didn’t think he was this foolish. To think he wouldn’t even be able to properly assess his opponent’s abilities! Though Lee Shin Woo was concealing them!\n’So we have the same idea.’\nThe faint, lingering idea of maintaining their alliance broke at that very instant. If that’s what he wanted, then he had no choice but to respond in kind!\n’Jin, just hide for a little bit.’\n’Wait, why?’\nWhile the Golden Shadow attacked Tarian and obscured his vision, Lee Shin Woo’s body melted into the air. He had discreetly spread his mana everywhere. Lee Shin Woo’s darkness was mixed with the Golden Shadow General’s darkness.\n[Die, you rebel!]\n[Hmph. It’s laughable that the undead curse has so much influence on one such as yourself !]\n[Keuk!]\nHe said roughly and swung his sword, pushing the Golden Shadow towards the golems. When he was finished dealing with them, Tarian looked for Lee Shin Woo once more, but... At that moment, something pierced through his back. What appeared behind him was clearly a member of the Golden Shadow.\n\"I cannot permit you to live, as someone who opposes our great Emperor!\"\n[Keoheok...!?]\nHis sword seemed entirely comprised of darkness. It was a shadow sword created through his Wild Card skill, which also doubled as all of his combat skills as well.\nThis sword, which simultaneously possessed the properties of Shadow Horn and Thorn Shadow, was quite powerful indeed, but by fusing with the surrounding darkness, it also paralyzed the attacked foe. A level 8 would be able to use their own mana to eliminate the ambient mana, but it would be impossible for Tarian.\n[The rebel’s stopped moving!]\n[One of ours has beaten Tarian Von Retadane!]\n[This is our chance. Attack while he’s still weakened!]\nLee Shin Woo’s attack was merely the precursor. Soon, the Golden Shadow rushed crazily towards him and mounted a full-on offensive. The Anti-Skull were clearly flustered and rushed over to stop them. Unfortunately, the darkness that covered them was completely different now.\n[Protect Lord Tarian... Keoheok!?]\n[W-Why!? I didn’t attack you...!]\n[D-Don’t move. This is their trick! Cut through the darkness!]\n[But Lord Tarian... Keok. Kaaaah!]\nThey had definitely aimed for the enemy, yet they had cut down their allies instead. They moved towards Tarian, yet they got farther and farther away. The power which had helped them resist the undead curse and maintain their intellect wasn’t helping them here.\n[The Beginner Dark Shadow element has become Lv8 and Magic has increased by 20.]\nIt was chaos. The Golden Shadow went wild, while the Anti-Skull cried out and cut through the darkness. Since their commander, who could’ve righted the situation, was paralyzed, Anti-Skull’s forces began to noticeably dwindle.\n[Keok. Damn you... With my light...!]\n\"Stop struggling. It won’t work.\"\nLee Shin Woo grinned and whispered to Tarian, who was desperately trying to gather his mana.\nBecause Tarian was a part of the Retadane family, who specialized in light, it was clear that he was trying to use some sort of light spell. But even if he tried, it wouldn’t matter. Even if he could create light, he was just level 7 as well as an undead, so he wouldn’t be able to beat back Lee Shin Woo’s darkness, would he?\nEven if he could create light powerful enough to undo his binds, he could just use Dark Shadow to reverse the light into darkness. So long as he wasn’t level 8 or possessed MAX light mastery or maybe even high rank mastery, he wouldn’t be able to overcome his Dark Shadow.\n[As I thought, you aren’t... Golden Shadow...!]\n\"I want to ask you something. Why do you hate me so much? Did you really think you could beat me?\"\n[How dare you oppose the Retadane clan’s light!]\n\"Mm. Oh, so that’s it.\"\nPerhaps Lee Shin Woo had been misunderstanding him. He’d thought that Anti-Skull, like his own troops, possessed a clear ego and would be able to move forward and develop, but... Perhaps these guys were the same as any regular undead.\n\"Hoo. If Seagald’s like this too, then I will be extremely disappointed.\".\"\n[Do you think... someone like you could defeat him...]\nLee Shin Woo decided not to listen anymore and gave him the peace of death. There was no reason to listen anymore.\n[You have acquired 5,698,100 Perium.]\n[You have acquired the Lv7 Tarian Von Retadane’s finger bone.]\nThe Golden Shadow delighted at the sight of Tarian’s body disappearing in the air, while Anti-Skull screamed. The golems were also tense, as someone much stronger than even the Four Heavenly Commanders had been so easily killed.\n[Golden Shadow. I know it was strong before, but to think it’d become even stronger after becoming undead...! We can’t drag this out any longer. Paul Zero, if we’re really allies, then please help our lord!]\n\"Sure.\"\nGuillotine Steelworker had no idea that Lee Shin Woo was the one who’d killed Tarian, yet he became warier of Golden Shadow and requested for Lee Shin Woo’s help! Lee Shin Woo came out of the darkness, revealing himself, and replied naturally.\nIn that short period of time, he returned to his Heaven Defying General form and was sitting atop his horse, as if they’d never been apart.\n[Darkness...?]\n\"Hoo.\"\n[You dare fight me with darkness... Huh? Ugh!]\nOnce Lee Shin Woo got involved, the Golden Shadow General attempted to retreat, but that was impossible. Lee Shin Woo had already finished analyzing his darkness. By the time Lee Shin Woo had mixed his darkness with the Golden Shadow General’s, Wild Card had already activated.\nHe could only move through the shadows because he was the source of the darkness. There’s no way he’d be able to move properly if another person’s darkness was mixed with his. As it was a level 8 authority, he should be able to turn it back to his entirely, but that was impossible right now. Because Lee Shin Woo’s darkness dwarfed his own.\n[What is this...!?]\n[Gigantic Fist!]\nWhile the Golden Shadow were hesitating, Arema Steelworker took the opportunity to unleash a killing blow. It might fall behind the other 12 Generals in terms of speed or special ability, but the force behind metal element mana concentrated at one point was unmatched!\n[Kahaahk...!]\nThe golem’s fist and the enemy’s armor colliding erupted in a sound akin to a mountain collapsing. Even Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t be able to replicate such physical force. This combination of tremendous mass and magic, which was only possible in a golem’s body, struck the Golden Shadow General.\n[General!]\n[Impossible. That person’s darkness...!]\nThe Golden Shadow General had, up until this point, remained untouched, but when the Golden Shadow saw their general fall, they were shocked and altogether attacked Arema Steelworker. However, the golems didn’t just stand still. Moreover, the Anti-Skull joined in, furious at their commander’s demise.\n[Good, then...]\n\"Hey, you gotta leave my share too.\"\nArema Steelworker was going to follow-up, without giving the Golden Shadow General a chance to recover, but Lee Shin Woo immediately stopped him.\nThe Golden Shadow General had escaped from the brink of death as if proving that investing almost all of his stats into Agility and Magic wasn’t for nothing. If one more of Arema’s attacks went through, then the Golden Shadow General would die and Lee Shin Woo’s contribution would lessen. In order to safely procure the bone, Lee Shin Woo had to be the one to kill the general.\n\"I told you before, didn’t I? The bones are mine.\"\n[You were just watching this entire time, yet you want to land the final blow?]\n\"I was analyzing his darkness in order to nullify it. If I didn’t, then would you have been able to defeat him this easily? You haven’t forgotten that he’s level 8 and one of the 12 Generals, have you?\"\n[...You’re not wrong.]\nHe definitely wasn’t wrong, as Wild Card could only fully activate when he’d fully analyzed his opponent. It looked like they’d taken him down so easily, but this was all due to his unseen efforts! Lee Shin Woo snorted, piercing the Golden Shadow General’s body with his lance and embedding it into the ground.\n[Kahahk...?]\n\"Tch. It’s not like I’m teaching a fish how to swim.\"\nThis would probably be his last-ditch effort. The Golden Shadow General tried to switch his body with a fake, like in Japanese manga, and hide within the darkness, so Lee Shin Woo cut through both the false and real bodies. If Lee Shin Woo hadn’t reached peak darkness mastery or didn’t possess Wild Card, then he might’ve been fooled.\n[How did you so easily...]\n\"It can’t be helped. You weren’t a good match for me. Regret the fact that I’m good at using the darkness element.\"\nLee Shin Woo grinned and put more pressure into his lance. The Shining Flame, covered on the outside by darkness, kept the Golden Shadow General from escaping and completely burned him away.\n[You have hunted one of the 12 Generals, the Lv8 Golden Shadow General, Vellun Von Dorthe! All heroes who contributed gain 50,000,000 Perium and all stats are increased by 100. You have acquired 15 permits to God’s secret shop. Proficiency in all combat-related skills increases significantly!]\n[The Wild Card skill has become Lv3. All stats have increased by 30.]\nThus, Lee Shin Woo killed another one of the 12 Generals. And he’d killed him so easily too!\n...He could’ve taken care of the general himself quite easily, but he decided not to tell anyone that.",

Heaven Defying General’s Stage - 5>\n[Commander!\n[That’s impossible!]\n[We were able to take care of him somehow.]\n[Whenever he’s in danger, he can just retreat into the shadows, so even if you beat him, you’re not supposed to be able to kill him...]\n[He caught him. No, the reason our Lord was even able to hit him was...]\nLee Shin Woo was able to kill one of the 12 Generals, the Golden Shadow General that was under the direct control of the Emperor, and everyone was shocked at how futilely he had died. In the midst of all that, Lee Shin Woo nonchalantly picked up the bone that was left behind. It was a leg bone.\nHe also dropped Perium, a Bayran Inner Map, his level 6 black leather armor, as well as a dark knife. Lee Shin Woo immediately went for the knife. He checked and mentally noted that his Invisible Heart was at its max level, nodded his head, and backed off.\n\"The rest is all yours.\" For more chapters visıt novel·fıre·net\n[...]\nArema Steelworker just stared at Lee Shin Woo, without even going for the loot.\nHe had realized that Lee Shin Woo had been one-sidedly controlling the battle. The reason he had been able to kill the Golden Shadow General so easily, especially when their affinity was so bad, was because of Lee Shin Woo.\nHe had won, but he didn’t feel good at all. It felt like Lee Shin Woo had played around with him throughout the entire fight. Arema had tried to not show his full strength, but Lee Shin Woo may already be aware of that. He had become a puppet that danced upon his stage.\n’To think that I, Arema Steelworker, would be so easily manipulated. Perhaps the moment I met this unknown undead, I was... No, perhaps when I met that skeleton long ago, I had already made the wrong decision.’\nAt first, Arema had planned to attack Lee Shin Woo when he was vulnerable, and trade their physical bodies for his life.\nBut he realized. That the only reason Lee Shin Woo had even deigned to bargain with them was that it was just easier for him. He hadn’t been afraid of him at all. If he attacked him now, then his physical body would be immediately destroyed. He was absolutely sure of it.\n[You are...]\nOnce he realized that his hated enemy was clearly stronger than him, Arema actually calmed down. Lee Shin Woo saw the change in his mental state and his eyes changed as well.\n[What are your intentions? You possess such power, so why are you pointlessly playing around here?]\n\"Life.\"\nLee Shin Woo curtly replied. There was no reason to lie, so he decided to answer honestly.\n\"I want to live in a world where I can just live my life.\"\n[You’re already dead, so how exactly are you going to achieve that?]\n\"That’s.... I wonder. It might work out in the end.\"\n[...]\nHe’d already found success. Lee Shin Woo had pursued life, and as a result of his endeavors, he had become an existence which couldn’t be classified as either living or dead.\nOf course, it was the result of developing several of his abilities, but... perhaps it was all due to his ardent wish to live.\nHis start as an undead came about due to his childish wish of ’not wanting to die’. But he didn’t need to tell Arema that. Arema Steelworker just watched him with a piercing gaze. Lee Shin Woo just shrugged his shoulders and said.\n\"Now, let’s finish up the rest of them. ...Anti-Skull, don’t just stand there discouraged and get a move on. Your commander is dead; do you plan on joining him!?\"\n[Keuk. Who’d die in a place like this?]\n[I’d rather not listen to someone like you. But... for Lord Tarian! Since it’s for Lord Tarian!]\n[I’ll get my revenge... on these Golden Shadow bastards!]\nOnce Tarian had died, Lee Shin Woo was able to reignite their spirits by slightly instigating them and manipulated them wholeheartedly. Of course, the level 7 elites among them were an exception, but even they couldn’t voice their hostility towards him now; they merely gritted their teeth and rushed towards the Golden Shadow. Without them even realizing that that was exactly what Lee Shin Woo wanted.\n[R-Retreat. We can’t hold on any longer!]\n[Keuk. But now that the Commander’s dead, we can’t hide within the darkness anymore...!]\n[Kill them all. Don’t let a single one of them escape!]\nOnce they realized how unfavorable the battle was for them, Golden Shadow tried to retreat immediately, but retreat was impossible even when Vellun Von Dorthe was alive, so how could it become possible for them now? Especially because the Anti-Skull were rushing towards them like madmen as if their very lives were burning out!\n[Keuk. These crazy bastards...!]\n[Fine, let’s die together!]\n[Kuoooooooh!]\n[Don’t forget the name of Anti-Skull, even in the grave!]\n[Uooooh! I’m not letting go of my sword until I kill you all!]\nTheir eyes shone red, and they heroically battled against the Golden Shadow, dying for their cause. They were determined to wipe out the Golden Shadow in order to avenge their leader, and emitted a fearsome spirit!\nThe golems watched on, dumbstruck, and shook. They didn’t know that Anti-Skull was such a fearsome organization! If their swords were aimed at them, instead of the Golden Shadow, then not all, but at least two of the remaining three Heavenly Commanders would have to be prepared for death.\n[T-These bastards... Retreat. Retreat!]\n[Killing your enemy is good and all, but throwing your lives away to do so is foolish... Ugh, they’re not listening at all!]\nThe level 7 elites were the only ones to maintain their sanity and were shocked at the sight of their comrades so vigorously attacking the Golden Shadow. They tried to stop them, but because of Lee Shin Woo instigating them with Tarian’s death, their hatred towards the Golden Shadow exploded, such that even they couldn’t stop their rampage anymore.\nThe level 6s were quickly dwindling. No one would’ve expected that such rare elites would be dying so futilely.\n[W-We can’t let this continue. Don’t you remember Lord Seagald’s orders!?]\n[You fools! If we all die here, then we’ll be hindering him... Kuheok!?]\nIn the midst of all that, there was a problem that arose. The level 7 elites were so busy trying to calm down their subordinates with their command-related skills that they temporarily let down their guard. Of the two of them, one of the commanders was killed by the Golden Shadow’s ambush (it was actually Lee Shin Woo)!\n[No, Douvaiiiiiiiiiiine!]\n[No, Commander Douvaine was...!]\n[Keuk. Kuaaaaaah! You bastards!]\nAnd so, two of the three level 7 commanders were killed. Lee Shin Woo didn’t even need to provoke them further. Their anger increased even more. But Lee Shin Woo decided to give them a little push.\n\"Avenge them! Can you really call yourselves Anti-Skull if you can’t even avenge your fallen comrades!?\"\n[Keuk. That’s not true...!]\n[Commander Tarian, Commander Douvaine... I’ll avenge you!]\n[...But whose voice is this anyway?]\nA voice provoked Anti-Skull from all across the area. No one knew who was speaking to them, nor where it was coming from, but it was enough to provoke the excited soldiers. And his provocation even reached the last remaining level 7 elite as well.\n[Damn it... Damn iiiiiiit!]\n\"Hm.\"\nThat was easy. Lee Shin Woo, who’d collected Douvaine’s bone, watched on and tilted his head. He could trick Anti-Skull as easily as he could fool the rest of the Empire’s undead!\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo was overlooking the fact that his Instigate skill had grown. When he’d gotten to level 8, his physical strength and magic had obviously grown, along with his elemental power, but he was not yet aware of how much his Joker’s innate abilities had grown.\n’This is strange... Is it because of Wild Card? No, did Instigate itself get stronger? It’s like I can just activate it with my mind now.’\nIf he were still level 7, then he wouldn’t be able to take control of another level 7 with just a few words!\nWhen he became level 8, he had gained Wild Card, and his very existence could affect the world. Now, his Instigate skill had neared the power of an authority that couldn’t be explained by his increase in physical strength, magic nor elemental power. And if he were to construct the proper situation with Wild Card, then he could easily control lower leveled existences than him like this.\n\"Good work.\"\n[Keok!?]\nLee Shin Woo tested out his Instigate skill a few more times and got a feel for his newly improved innate skills. Once he’d succeeded in applying Wild Card better than before, he killed the last level 7 elite commander, who had been wildly fighting against the Golden Shadow.\nGolden Shadow was almost completely eliminated, as the remaining Anti-Skull force had staked their lives on killing them. But they were actually already dead.\nWhat an ideal scenario. It was exactly as Lee Shin Woo had planned. If he hadn’t felt such murderous intent, then he would’ve watched a little while longer.\n\"Hoo. It’s gotten a bit cleaner.\"\n[...]\nLee Shin Woo took care of the remaining Golden Shadow and surveyed the battlefield. Since the golems weren’t particularly hostile towards him, he decided to keep them around for now. Aside from Stake Steelworker, who had been killed by the Golden Shadow General, the golems were pretty much unscathed.\n[You not only led so many opposing forces here but also manipulated them to your heart’s content and achieved the result you desired. This karma goes beyond tactics; it is more akin to ’control’ or ’domination’.]\n[You have acquired the title, ’Overlord of the Subconscious’. All stats have increased by 15. The Instigate skill has become Lv9 and Magic has increased by 20. The High Rank Command skill has become Lv8 and all stats have increased by 5. When used in conjunction with Instigate, you can more effectively ignore the effects of the opposing side’s Command skill.]\nHe’d somewhat expected this, but he’d acquired another amazing title. Lee Shin Woo looked at it, shrugged his shoulders, and then collected the loot.\nThe golems merely watched him, dumbfounded. They didn’t know what he’d done exactly, but they had some idea as to what role he had in this battle. But in the midst of that, Arema Steelworker quietly said.\n[...Is this what you wanted?]\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n[No... Never mind.]\nThen, Guillotine Steelworker quietly looked at Arema. Arema firmly shook his head and Guillotine bit his lip and stepped back. The other golems saw those gestures and realized what their commander was conveying. They all wore the same indescribable expression in silence.\n’Good. They’re completely disheartened.’\n’You’re evil.’\nLee Shin Woo was pleased with the result. If he wanted, he could’ve taken care of the situation more quietly. But he’d wanted to show the golems ’who was superior’ by giving them a taste of his abilities. It seemed like it worked.\n’Now...’\nIt was time to absorb all the bones he couldn’t before, as he had been so busily moving around!\nHe was the type to eat the tastiest part of the meal first, but because he wanted to know what the Anti-Skull’s true goal was (as well as Seagald Von Retadane’s location and plans), so he combined the two commanders and Tarian’s bones together and absorbed them first.\nEven though they were elites, they were a lower level than him, so absorbing all three at once only gave him a measly 30 stats, but that wasn’t what was important. What was important was...\n[Lord Seagald... Please come back safely.]\n[Don’t worry. There are only three people who can stop me in the Empire. One of them, Arema Steelworker, has forged a temporary alliance with us. ...I’ll be fine by myself. I’ll be back. I’m counting on you guys to lure them away.]\nBy absorbing all three of their memories simultaneously, memories flowed through him automatically. They were quite recent memories, so Seagald Von Retadane was definitely included in them.\nThat’s right. This was a memory of the three commanders seeing Seagald off before he undertook an independent mission. As expected, Seagald was here! Tarian’s forces were just bait!\n[You will achieve everything you want.]\n[We’ll succeed in the name of Anti-Skull!]\n[For the Empire!]\n[Yeah.]\nSeagald Von Retadane’s voice was clean and possessed a clear will behind it. Lee Shin Woo tried to go through the memories ASAP, as he needed to find out where Seagald was, but then, the last remaining memory of Seagald resounded through his head.\n[For the Empire. ...For my foolish little sister who has lost her way.]\nLee Shin Woo suddenly raised his head.\nHe heard a ’boom’ go off from within the walls where the cannon was located.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 46 part1",
    "content": "<Chapter 46. Death’s Companion - 1>\nLee Shin Woo figured out where Seagald was. He was already in the center of Bayran, protected by the thorn wall! Tarian’s force had just been bait and the golems, which they’d form a temporary alliance with, were as well.\n[So they were trying to kill us here?]\n\"No. They made it so that you couldn’t interfere. It seems like their interests don’t align with yours. ...Or they know exactly who you are.\"\n[...]\nEven after absorbing his precious subordinate’s bones, Lee Shin Woo didn’t know what Seagald’s true intentions were. However, he was sure of one thing: that this loyalty towards the Empire hadn’t changed.\n’Was Anti-Skull really just created to protect people from the undead curse? To kill the Emperor, who spread the undead curse? No, probably not. There’s no way it’s that simple.’ ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ N0veI.Fiɾe.net\nOn second thought, there was something else that was strange. The Undead Emperor, Jissehanu, had seemingly been researching immortality but was actually looking for a way to break through the barrier. And there must’ve been a few people who knew what he was planning.\n’The Retadanes are a family of high rank nobles that have been with Jissehanu since the very beginning. Were they really not aware of how to get past the barrier? Seira might not have, but it wouldn’t make sense for Seagald Von Retadane, the past head of the Retadane family, to have no knowledge about it.’\nNo... What even was Anti-Skull? Was it truly an organization designed to research methods to resist the undead curse? Was that all? If not, then perhaps...\n\"Damn. Let’s think about this later. Let’s get a move on for now!\"\n[Agreed. It seems like our alliance with Anti-Skull is already meaningless...!]\nAs always, Arema Steelworker despised following Lee Shin Woo’s orders and moving according to his will. However, he hated Seagald Von Retadane more, who’d put him in this situation in the first place.\nAbove all, he wanted to know what Seagald was planning. His strength may not be enough, but he was sure the Heaven Defying General would be able to find out.\n\"I’m going at full speed, so try to keep up. Leave behind anyone who can’t keep up.\"\n[It might take a bit longer, but we’re all going.]\n\"Your choice. Let’s go!\"\nJin really ran at full speed. They couldn’t reveal everything, so Lee Shin Woo didn’t reveal his darkness and Jin didn’t reveal her light. However, just the fact that she used all of her skills and exhibited such overwhelming speed was enough to astound the others with her speed.\n[That horse...!?]\n[I knew he wasn’t normal, but to think even his horse was unusual!]\nThe Metal Army realized just how far ahead Lee Shin Woo had gotten, gritted their teeth, and followed him. Fortunately, no other traps activated as they rushed after him!\nArema and the rest of the golems were relieved, thinking that all the traps had been destroyed already. They couldn’t even imagine that Lee Shin Woo was actively disarming them as they went along.\n’Anyway, what was that explosion all about anyway? It must’ve been Seagald Von Retadane. If not, then it might’ve been the Spirit General, Dana Von Etliber.’\n’It looked like magic to me. It’d be nice if it was Kratia or Prince, but it probably wasn’t. Which means...’\nThe first thing that came to mind was the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin. There was a chance he was here. The palace might’ve sent some ’insurance’, aside from the Golden Shadow General.\n\"There really are three of the four Heavenly Commanders (of the 12 Generals) here.\"\nIf that were indeed true, then not immediately striking down Arema Steelworker while also bringing him to his side was a wise decision. If the Annihilation Flame Sword God and the Archmage were truly there, then it wouldn’t matter how strong Lee Shin Woo was, he wouldn’t be able to take them on whilst protecting his allies.\n’Damn. That only matters if they’re still alive.’\nAs a test, Lee Shin Woo sent all of them a private chat request. All of them denied his request, but the fact that they even denied his request meant that they were still alive.\nBut it also meant that they didn’t have the time to answer him... That’s probably what it meant. It was just a hypothesis, but there should be three level 8 members of the 12 Generals in there!\n[Lord Paul Zero!]\n[We were waiting for you!]\nLee Shin Woo soon arrived in front of the thorn wall. He’d called the Chi Pauls beforehand. Aside from the three who’d been injured and retreated, all of the Chi Pauls had gathered here.\n[I see it. The thorn wall... Huh? Are those your subordinates?]\n[They’re not weaker than me. Where exactly did they come from...?]\nArema Steelworker and his elites had arrived. They were shocked once they saw the Chi Pauls standing by. Although they were standing right in front of them, they couldn’t properly sense their presence, as if they were looking at the Golden Shadow.\n[I would’ve been suspicious if you hadn’t called your subordinates in such a dire situation. So you did have your forces here.]\n[They’re all strong too. How did you nurture them in the Empire...? No, wait. Did they come from the surface?]\n[...Hoo.]\nThe golems stirred up a commotion while the Chi Pauls desperately suppressed their urge to kill them. He knew this would happen. After all, they had been used as their test subjects in the past!\nFortunately, unlike Tarian, they were decent enough actors to not allow their emotions to show. It was all due to Lee Shin Woo’s influence. This is why you had to have a good master!\n[Paul Zero. Do you have a way to get through the wall? If you don’t, then we have no choice but for the two of us to attack at once.]\n\"We don’t have time to waste here.\"\nLee Shin Woo replied and extended his hand, feeling as though Arema was a pain in the ass. Even now, he was trying to get a feel for his abilities. The area of the wall his fingertips were pointed at collapsed without any resistance.\nHe had condensed the Evil Eye ore into a single, tiny piece, which was floating over to him. But such a trivial thing had given Arema Steelworker quite the shock.\n[Impossible. The thorn wall!?]\n\"Let’s go.\"\nHe’d completely broken the link in the affected area, so the collapsed area didn’t repair itself. With just one gesture, Lee Shin Woo had broken the thorn wall, the Empire’s pride and joy. Lee Shin Woo just took command of the Chi Pauls and went inside.\nArema Steelworker couldn’t believe his eyes and pounded on the thorn wall with his full strength. Aside from the area Lee Shin Woo had just demolished, the rest of the wall retained its incredible durability.\n[Y-You’re...?]\n\"I see it. No... It’s tremendous.\"\nThe thorn wall must also prevent people from sensing the mana within its walls. While he could sense the cannon’s immense mana before, once he broke through the thorn wall and went inside, he realized that that was just the tip of the iceberg.\nThat wasn’t all. He also felt traces of other mana spread far and wide...!\n\"It is the Archmage.\"\n[Feotane Von Seldin... This isn’t even funny.]\nThere were monsters everywhere. There were traps set-up around the city that summoned monsters or undead, but this wasn’t even comparable to that. The Archmage had probably used his spatial magic to summon monsters from wherever he could!\n[Break through!]\n[Understood!]\nFor now at least, the golems and the Chi Pauls were like-minded, and charged. Lee Shin Woo and Arema Steelworker used their respective Command skills to aid their troops and fought at the vanguard.\nHundreds, no thousands of monsters sensed their hostility and rushed towards them, but they couldn’t stop Lee Shin Woo or Arema Steelworker.\n\"Uooooooh! We’re running all the way to the cannon!\"\n[Show them the pride of a Steelworker!]\nThe two level 8s (one of them was riding atop another level 8) charged side by side. It looked like an eraser as they cleared a path through the battlefield. Of course, the ones they didn’t kill were soon erased by the following Chi Pauls and golems.\nIt was a real spectacle; hundreds, no thousands of monsters turning to dust in an instant.\n\"Ah...!\"\n\"T-The Heaven Defying General!?\"\nIn the midst of all that, the heroes finally noticed them. Kratia, who knew that Lee Shin Woo was the Heaven Defying General, looked slightly relieved, while Prince was shocked that the Heaven Defying General had shown up with the Metal General. She was more concerned about Lee Shin Woo not showing up than being fearful of them.\n\"W-What about Junior!? What about our Junior!?\"\n\"Arema, we’re helping the heroes. They’re on our side.\"\n[Those half-wits, huh. I thought as much, but... Are you a hero who died and turned into an undead? And one who still retained the spirit of a hero?]\n\"Think what you want. But listen to my orders.\"\n[Keuk...!]\nIt was great that he’d found them, but at the same time, there were others that caught his eye. First up was Feotane Von Seldin, who was floating around the cannon and emitting an overwhelming pressure. As expected, he’d found his way here too!\n[Hm. It seems we have more guests. If you wanted to kill the Empire’s monsters so badly, then you should’ve requested an audience with His Majesty first!]\nOnce he’d discovered Lee Shin Woo’s group, he seemed to get a bit tense, though superficially, as he didn’t lose his cool. He was probably confident in his spatial element. And he’d also used that very magic to cause chaos.\n[Ah. Aaah...!]\n[Giiiiii!]\n[Kugureureuaaaaah!]\nBut there was a bigger issue than the Archmage himself. A beautiful woman was tied to the center of the cannon’s gun barrel with a chain made of ’Evil Eye’.\nShe had black hair and pale, white skin. He could sense a large quantity of mana from within her, and there were hundreds of corrupted spirits roaming around her... Most of them were level 6, or even level 7 spirits, which were further increasing her power.\n[Lv8 Spirit General Dana Von Etliber (Undead transformation delayed)]\nOnce he was finished looking her over, he was shocked at the information he saw. What? She wasn’t undead? Her undead transformation was being delayed? What the hell did that even mean? He didn’t know what it meant, so he examined her himself and came to a shocking conclusion.\n’The undead curse... Still hasn’t properly saturated her body.’\nShe was definitely being affected by the undead curse. She was indeed being affected by it, but the curse was being sucked out of her body as if Lee Shin Woo or Jin were absorbing it.\nThus, her undead transformation hadn’t progressed. She was experiencing so much pain, but he couldn’t really say that she was alive. If that’s the case, then where was the mana that escaped her body heading? The answer was simple. It was going into the cannon.\n\"Hey, Arema. Even if you were to fire this death energy charged cannon at the palace, it doesn’t seem like it’ll do any damage. On the contrary, won’t it make him stronger instead?\"\n[...It does seem that way. Seagald, that bastard. What the hell is he thinking?]\nThat’s how it was built. The mana of the city’s inhabitants and spirits would be gathered by the Spirit General’s ability so that the cannon could be fired. The undead curse had filled the Undead Empire, so the curse that affected her body was being drained by the cannon itself.\nIt was truly horrifying, but... It was precisely because of this that she hadn’t turned into an undead yet and had survived. No one could’ve expected this. They hadn’t scrapped this failed project before moving on to the next, which had resulted in all their failed products remaining here. That’s what this all meant.\n’She doesn’t seem sane though.’\nShe had been the cannon’s ’straw’ that supplied energy to it by gathering the world’s and spirits’ magic for dozens of years. It would be a miracle if she had actually retained her sanity.\nSeira Von Retadane must have thought that she wouldn’t be in this situation as a princess. And right now, Seira Von Retadane was...\n\"Die. Just die already!\"\n[...Little sister. Now’s not the time for this. Don’t you see that Lich looking down at us?]\n\"Die! Please... die!\"\nHaving a bloody sibling feud with the Annihilation Flame Sword God, Seagald Von Retadane.",

    "content": "<Chapter 46. Death’s Companion - 2>\n’I knew she’d be like this.’\nLee Shin Woo thought as he watched her crazily swinging her flail at the Annihilation Flame Sword God. He knew she’d be like this if she met Seagald, so it didn’t feel out of place at all.\nThis is why he didn’t want to bring her along. Plus, he’d wanted to take care of Seagald before he got into the city, but it was too late, he was already here! He hadn’t planned for this!\n[Tch. Damn skeleton! There are too many monsters, so there’s nothing much we can do...!]\n[Guaaaaahk!]\n[Gieeeeek!]\nArema Steelworker gritted his teeth with a similar expression from beside him. In the midst of that, Arema punched with his steel fist, killing dozens of monsters in a single blow; truly befitting of one of the Empire’s Four Heavenly Commanders. Lee Shin Woo just couldn’t compare in terms of pure physical strength.\nHe was strong enough to take on Seagald at least. Lee Shin Woo wanted to be the one to take on Seagald, but he was concerned about the Lich. It was obvious that Arema wasn’t a good match for the Archmage! That’s why he’d moved so stealthily before!\n\"I’ll take care of the Lich. You handle Seagald. It’s unfortunate that that crazy woman’s there, but you’ll have to put your life on the line.\"\n[...Don’t forget to uphold your end of the bargain. We’ll engrave that contract upon our very souls.]\n’Sure. If you can even find your own soul, that is.’\nA person’s words become karma, especially if the speaker is at a high ’level’. Breaking one’s promise would result in extremely negative karma.\nUnfortunately, Lee Shin Woo possessed karma that specialized in lying, cheating, or coming up with excuses! What’s worse, Lee Shin Woo also had the Shining Flame, Dark Shadow, and Dark Flame, so the contract was meaningless before him; Arema was wasting his time by trusting in the contract.\n\"A contract’s sacred. I have no intention of carrying these things around forever, so don’t worry and just go fight.\"\n[Ha. You sound trustworthy. Worry about yourself. Since it’s a lot more troublesome fighting against the Archmage than Seagald.]\n\"I’ll promise you this. My battle will end a lot quicker than yours.\"\nLee Shin Woo assured, looked up at the Archmage, and had Jin unfurl her wings. Everyone on the battle flinched, as the ridiculously fast horse had sprouted wings.\nBut what came next was even more shocking. She fluttered her wings and arrived in front of the Archmage instantaneously. Lee Shin Woo was already aiming the tip of his lance, which was covered in a swaying black energy, at the middle of the Archmage’s forehead.\n[Huh!?]\n\"Ha!\"\nLee Shin Woo let out a short battle cry and thrust forward! It was so quick that no one could tell where it was going. On the contrary, it felt like it’d be easier to dodge a random lightning bolt that came from a clear blue sky. As a Lich, whose stats were primarily focused on magic, he couldn’t dodge it.\nAnd he thought there was no real reason to dodge it either. Feotane’s body, as well as the area around him, was tinged in his magic, and the space was distorted. Once he entered the Archmage’s domain, it wouldn’t matter how strong Lee Shin Woo’s attack was; his attack would either go awry or break under the pressure.\n[What!? My mana!? Why is my mana...!?]\nAt least, that’s what Feotane Von Seldin thought, but overconfidence would always come back to bite you. Lee Shin Woo erased the Archmage’s spatial mana, as if he were putting out a candle flame, and thrust his lance into his forehead. He screamed in pain as if he were an ordinary person meeting a ninja in the middle of the night!\n\"If you wanted to dodge my attack, then you should’ve tried something new. Heup!\"\n[Guaaaaaaah!]\nAfter stabbing the Lich, he threw his lance into the air. In an instant, the Lich’s agonizing cries became distant. If he could, he would’ve taken this more slowly, but Lee Shin Woo didn’t have that option right now; this was the best he could do.\n’Ha. He’s really something. Dark Shadow was almost not enough; I almost needed to pull out the Shining and Dark Flames too... The Archmage really lives up to his name... Wait, why is that guy still level 8?’ ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ n0velfire.net\nLee Shin Woo had discreetly applied Dark Shadow to his previous attack, allowing him to nullify the Archmage’s mana and reach him. Although he could use innate elements, repeatedly fighting in CQC against the Lich, who could almost infinitely use his spatial magic, was impossible.\nHis instinct as a Joker allowed him to put up a strong front, but it was a close call. He’d almost used 70% of his mana in that last attack. It was really a close call. He thought he’d die.\n’Sseup. The title of Four Heavenly Commanders isn’t for nothing.’\nHe’d only realized this after reaching level 8 and fighting against them, but the Archmage’s magic was considerable. It was proof that he was highly ranked amongst level 8s.\nHe could barely match it if he were to call his 17 weapons and suck them dry, but if he were to do that, then he would soon be crushed by the spatial magic. Feotane Von Seldin possessed enough magic to overcome Lee Shin Woo’s elemental advantage.\n’...If I want to fight against a guy like that, then my best option’s doing as much damage as I can while his spatial magic’s disabled and then running away. Let’s move on.’\nDoing as much damage as he could and then retreating. He wasn’t going to repeat that last attack again. Since there was no way someone of his level would get hit by the same attack twice!\nHe became even more sure of it when he saw Arema Steelworker, who showed what a true warrior was; Lee Shin Woo was only good at CQC because of Jin. He actually didn’t specialize in it. What he did specialize in was...\n[Keoheok!?]\nControlling bone! Before the Lich got a hold of himself and pulled the lance out, Lee Shin Woo caused it to explode through Rule of Bone; the explosion was focused entirely on the Lich!\nIn order to deal with this, the Lich released his own magic, but he was suddenly struck by another lance. The Archmage had been so focused on his magic in order to deal with the resulting energy of the explosion that he couldn’t dodge the second lance.\n[That won’t work twice... Kuhahk!]\nThe Archmage’s overwhelming spatial magic had crumpled the lance, but it didn’t matter. The lance had already pierced his body, and crumpling up a weapon wouldn’t decrease the force of its explosion!\nHe exploded that one too. The Lich emitted even more magic to deal with the resulting energy, but Lee Shin Woo then lodged another weapon, a sword gleaming with white light... and caused a third explosion.\n[Critical Hit!]\n[Ugh...!]\nThe Lich wasn’t able to withstand Lee Shin Woo’s attacks and felt his consciousness go white as his body and magic began to fade.\nThis severing property was definitely the light element, or perhaps something even greater...! Fortunately, it wasn’t powerful enough to sever him from his ’core’, but if he were to die here, then he would lose a significant amount of magic.\nHowever, there was something even more important than that...!\n[You tricked me, who controls space itself... How!? How did you do it!?]\n\"You already know, don’t you. Yeah, I tricked you. Or rather, I tricked your mana.\"\nVictory in a battle between magicians relied on three factors. One, the ’level’ of the one using magic. Two, the ’level’ of one’s magic; in terms of this battle, it’d be the ’level’ of his elements. And finally, the quantity of the mana one possessed.\nHe’d cleared both the first and second conditions, but he didn’t feel like he could overcome the Archmage in the third, so he used Rule of Bone and Wild Card in conjunction to overcome that hurdle.\nHe had a brief period of time to recover between hitting him with a weapon and then exploding it. If he could repeatedly give himself that time, then it would be Lee Shin Woo’s win.\nThus, Lee Shin Woo could fool his wide-reaching mana senses with his Wild Card skill and struck with his weapons. This was only possible because of his Acting skill, which had leveled up and enabled him to fool a part of the world, mana itself.\n[Trick...? You tricked my mana...!?]\n\"If you don’t want them to see, then shut their eyes. If you don’t want them to smell, then block their nose. If you don’t want them to hear your secret, then you cover their ears. Watch. If I know ’what’ I want to trick, then it’s easy.\"\n[Even if you did trick me, how were you able to erase the spatial magic protecting me... Kahahk!]\nThe Archmage couldn’t figure out what he’d done and gritted his teeth. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo summoned a fourth weapon, sliced apart a bracelet the Archmage was wearing, and then lodged it into the Archmage’s chest and exploded it. The bracelet was probably an artifact that supplemented his Health or Magic. The Archmage’s body had already reached its limit and should’ve disappeared already; his bracelet and his body glimmered and he had been alive despite the critical damage.\nThat ended it. Ultimately, the Archmage ’died’ without getting an answer to his question. The Archmage hadn’t been able to figure out the specifics of Lee Shin Woo’s innate element.\n\"Tch.\"\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo clicked his tongue, as though he’d found the Archmage’s death and disappearance annoying. The reason was clear. Since all he had left behind was the bracelet he’d sliced in half.\nThat meant only one thing. The Lich hadn’t truly died. It didn’t matter if his physical body was destroyed since his soul remained safe and sound within a separate container. His physical body would eventually be restored. He’d be back.\n’I tried erasing his existence with Shining Flame, stealing his soul through Dark Flame, and when that didn’t work, I tried using Dark Shadow to inverse the transmission of his consciousness back to his container and bring the container here instead, but...’\nEach and every one of the weapons Lee Shin Woo had used had held an innate element, but none of his three innate elements had worked.\nThen, did that mean that he had no choice but to find that damn Lich’s soul to kill him? The Emperor was probably a Lich too, so he would need to find a way to destroy souls remotely...!\n\"Huh?\"\nIn the midst of all this, the floating bracelet gathered an enormous amount of mana and restored itself. No, that wasn’t all. It actually became stronger than before. Lee Shin Woo then grabbed the artifact.\n[The artifact has absorbed a portion of the Lich’s core mana and is evolving!]\n[You have acquired the Lv8 Proof of Death (+4)!]\n\"Core mana...?\"\nThe artifact was comprised of bones, but it was difficult to figure out how it was made; it was probably made from the bones of an ancient high level monster, as well as the Archmage’s own bones.\nBut there was something more important than all that. Lee Shin Woo had destroyed the artifact, yet it had actually evolved once the Lich had disappeared. Why? The answer was included in the message. It had absorbed some of the Lich’s core mana... In other words, Lee Shin Woo had succeeded in taking a portion of Feotane Von Seldin’s soul.\n’So it wasn’t entirely ineffective, huh.’\nLee Shin Woo smiled slightly. He hadn’t been going in the wrong direction. Now all he needed to do was push on and refine himself! It was good that he fought the Archmage here. With that feeling of relief, he turned around, but...\n[Oh...]\n\"Gu, Keoheok.\"\n[It looks like we’ll finally be together, little sister.]\n\"Ah...\"\nHe saw Seagald’s sword pierce through Seira Von Retadane’s heart.",

    "content": "<Chapter 46. Death’s Companion - 3>\nArema Steelworker had really done his best. He was not only mad at Seagald but was also stressed out from all the events that had occurred here, so he went at full power and tried taking it all out on Seagald.\n[It’s not your turn yet, Arema.]\n[Ha, are you avoiding me?]\n[Seira, are you going to oppose me?]\nHowever, Seagald just ignored Arema’s attack and taunt, and concentrated entirely on his little sister, Seira Von Retadane.\nOne simply couldn’t avoid the Metal General without any repercussions; as evidence of this, Seagald’s armor was chipped in several places. Even so, he didn’t bat an eye at Arema.\n\"Kuhaaaaaaaah!\"\n[Haha. You’ve grown a lot!]\nMoreover, Seira Von Retadane wouldn’t accept Arema’s help; she just glared at Seagald with eyes wide open and swung her flail. Arema would have to be careful so that he didn’t get in the way of that flail.\nThe power of severing, or light mana, was extremely dangerous to Arema Steelworker as well, even though he was already separated from his physical body and his soul was safely encased in a golem’s shell.\n[Kuaaaah! You’re both crazy!]\n[My lord, we’ll get that crazy woman away from him! Then you can focus on the Annihilation Flame Sword God...]\n[You can’t. Since this damn woman is level 8... Grr!]\nWhy did he have to be involved in this? Why did he have to save that foolish woman, who was being manipulated by the curse?\nArema attacked once more, his fists containing all of that rage and frustration. Although he wasn’t looking, Seagald was still able to dodge Arema’s attack and faced off against Seira once more.\n[I made you wait too long, Seira.]\n\"Die! Just die!\"\n[I’m sorry I made you worry. But the pieces are all set now. That’s why I came to see you.]\n\"Uoooooooh! The power of light!\"\n[What a sight.]\nHow could they be so engaged in their conversation without caring about anything around them? Seira being crazy was a given, but Seagald was too. Last they spoke, he seemed quite sane, so how did it turn out like this? Or was there something that induced such behavior?\n’No, that wasn’t important.’\nIf Seagald wasn’t going to take him on, then he had no choice but to unleash an attack; one so powerful that Seagald would have no choice but to shift his focus!\nArema released his Gigantification and returned to his normal, human form. He then focused all of his mana into one place. The ambient mana that wasn’t yet under Seagald or Retadane’s control was being sucked in by Arema.\n[This is...!]\nMetal, the element he could only learn once he became a golem. By concentrating his mana into a single spot and converting it into the metal element, he could temporarily form a metallic substance that surpassed the limits of metal.\n[Metal God!]\nIt was only temporary, but for an instant, Arema Steelworker had formed metal that surpassed all metal in this world and had truly become a Metal God. He possessed exceptional durability and destructive power that befitted his namesake, the Metal God General.\nWhile Seira and Seagald were fighting, Arema charged at full speed. As expected, Seagald noticed this. He couldn’t dodge it. He could only take it or block it. Seira was also attacking him, meaning he couldn’t dodge either of the attacks.\n’Huh?’\nAt that moment, Arema felt something strange. It felt as though Seagald had disappeared. In the past, he’d felt something similar from the Archmage. Was it the spatial element? No, Seagald wielded the light element, so that didn’t make any sense...\n’But it doesn’t matter.’\nThe Archmage was a pain in the ass, but it was because of that that he had researched ways of dealing with him. His ’Metal God’ ability was one of them. It covered his outer body in metal and was also an aggregation of high level mana; just by existing, the Metal God ability repressed the usage of ambient mana!\nA level 8’s authority, or rather, their ability to dominate mana, was in essence, a guaranteed reinforcement in a small space. At this range, it wouldn’t matter what he used; whether it was spatial magic or something else, it wouldn’t be perfect! Arema kicked off the ground one last time. His extended right fist hit Seagald’s helmet...\n[Huh...!?]\nArema yelled in bewilderment. The moment his fist struck, his helmet turned into transparent flames. Transparent flame? What the hell was that?\nThese blazing flames were so powerful that they threatened to melt Arema’s fist. But his own Metal God ability was no pushover. If Seagald was being protected by these unknown flames, then all he needed to do was get through them...!\n[You’ve improved, Arema.]\n[You’re the one who hid such a terrifying ability...]\nUltimately, he managed to erase Seagald’s flame, though a portion of his hand was melted away in exchange.\nTo be exact, he had destroyed half of Seagald’s head, which had been protected by the transparent flame-turned helmet. Seagald had concentrated entirely on his element, like Arema had, and had changed his helmet temporarily. Or at least, that was Arema’s assumption.\n’Tch. In terms of elements, he’s way above me. If that Retadane wench hadn’t attacked with me, then I would’ve been pushed back... More importantly, did the Heaven Defying General see this? No, is he actually putting up a fight against the Lich?’\nIn any case, Seagald was critically injured. A part of his body had melted away, so he couldn’t fight anymore, but if the Heaven Defying General were to help out, then they should be able to kill Seagald. However...\n[Oh...]\n\"Gu, Keoheok.\"\n[It looks like we’ll finally be together, little sister.]\n\"Ah...\"\nArema, who was shaken by Seagald’s newfound power, suddenly realized what just happened. Seagald had taken both of their attacks, but in return, had stabbed Seira in the heart!\n[Damn it...!]\n\"Guaaaaaaaah!\"\n[Open your eyes, Seira. Don’t be controlled by your hatred. Open your eyes and look at me. I’ll show you the right path!]\n[So you’ve finally killed your little sister!] Content orıginally comes from novel{f}ire.net\n\"Urgh...!\"\nA transparent light erupted from Seagald’s blade and was flowing through Retadane’s body. Seira, who’d lost her flail, began to shake.\nThe light that burst from her body accepted those bizarre flames and began to change her body. To put it bluntly, it was an incredibly unpleasant scene.\n\"Ha!\"\n[Keuk!?]\nAt that moment, Lee Shin Woo, who’d descended from the sky, thrust his sword at Seagald. Seagald hadn’t moved an inch when Arema had attacked him with his Metal Body, but surprisingly, he avoided Lee Shin Woo’s attack and retreated.\n\"Transparent flames. Is that what it means by Annihilation Flame? It wasn’t the power of burning others, but burning oneself. ...It’s an innate element that was created by fusing fire and light together, right?\"\n[...Heaven Defying General, Paul Zero. To think you’d be able to defeat the Archmage this quickly.]\n\"Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to kill him for good. That guy sure is good at running away.\"\nLee Shin Woo landed futilely. The white light at the tip of his Shining Bone Sword had missed its target and merely burned the air around him. No, perhaps it had burned away some of Seagald’s flames that he didn’t have time to withdraw.\nIf he could, he would’ve helped Seira immediately, but his instincts were telling him not to look away from Seagald. He pointed his Shining Bone Sword at Seagald and looked at him.\n\"Your control over your magic is exceptional. You feel like a real magic swordsman...\"\nLee Shin Woo was superior in magic, but Seagald seemed physically stronger than him. But the worst part was Seagald’s innate element; according to his title, it was called ’Annihilation Flame’.\nContrary to his Shining Flame, which came outwards and extinguished all cause and effect, the Annihilation Flame was collected inside of one’s body and erased one’s own cause and effect. One could erase their presence, their mana, their physical body, traces of any injuries, or even a portion of the curse that shackled them!\nHow far it reached depended on the user. Thus, Arema Steelworker’s attack, which should’ve been fatal, was not, and his attack against Seira had become unavoidable when it normally should have been.\nIn a sense, it was similar to Lee Shin Woo’s Wild Card skill, which fooled his enemies and the world itself. It would probably have a great affinity with his Wild Card ability. Maybe just as much as his Dark Shadow ability did.\n[What is that flame? You’re a lot different than what I’d heard.]\n\"You’re a lot different from what I’ve heard about you too, so I’m quite surprised myself.\"\nLee Shin Woo greeted him and took a step back. Seira was staggering and Lee Shin Woo grabbed Seagald’s sword, which was still embedded in her heart. The Annihilation Flame within her body blazed, as if putting up fierce resistance, but once he focused his white flames into it, her body became cleared of the transparent flames.\n\"Keuk.\"\n\"Guaaaaaaaaahk!\"\n\"Just bear with it, you old bag!\"\nHe pulled out the sword and vaporized it upon realizing that he couldn’t steal it. Now wasn’t the time to be greedy over a weapon.\n\"Hoo... Arema, can you keep fighting?\"\n[How can you say that when you look at me? Now it’s your turn.]\n\"I have to treat this woman.\"\n[Treat? A way other than completely killing her before she becomes an undead?]\nArema said sarcastically. Someone calmly assessing the situation and then speaking logically pissed Lee Shin Woo off the most. Lee Shin Woo clicked his tongue and extended his hand towards Arema. It was the most fundamental power of the light element: the ability to heal!\n\"This should be enough, right?\"\nHe infused a ton of magic into extinguishing the Annihilation Flame and healing Arema. Of course, his body wasn’t exactly the same as before, and his spent magic wouldn’t return, but this should be enough for him to continue fighting.\n[This is...!? Who the hell are you!?]\n\"Doesn’t matter. Fight him a little while longer.\"\n[I’d rather you not touch her right now.]\nSeagald said and instantaneously appeared in front of Lee Shin Woo with a new sword in hand. He swung his sword downwards... but Jin came rushing over at light speed and kicked him away.\n[Ha!]\n[Kuhahk!?]\nThe sight of her feet sprouting steel thorns covered in white light and hitting Seagald was quite striking. That wasn’t all. Her entire body, including her wings, was wrapped in light as if she were a mythical beast.\n[A horse!? How did a horse!?]\n\"My horse will help you. Can you do it?\"\n[There’s no way a horse exists that can kick Seagald at light speed...! Damn it. Fine, I’ll do it! That’s fine, right!?]\nArema, who saw Seagald fly away from Jin’s kick and barely stand up, was speechless at such an unexplainable phenomenon but was soon ready to fight once more.\n[Now that it’s come to this, I wouldn’t be surprised if a skeleton turned into a human. Seagald, how did it feel, getting kicked by a horse!?]\n[A skill befitting an irregular. However...]\nSeagald’s body blazed within the air and then disappeared. His mana and his presence had disappeared, but everyone was sure that he was still here.\n[No matter how fast light is, it can’t catch something that doesn’t exist.]\n[Hmph.]\nJin snorted, but Arema broke into a cold sweat. She wasn’t experienced in battle. She wouldn’t last long against Arema.\n’Whatever you’re doing, do it fast. Hurry...!’\nShe scraped at the air with her horse hooves. Arema tightened his fist as they were simultaneously attacked by the transparent Sword God.\nLee Shin Woo confirmed that they were fighting and quickly turned around to begin Seira’s ’treatment’.",

    "content": "<Chapter 46. Death’s Companion - 4>\n\"Huaah! Uooooh!\"\n\"Oh, granny’s got a nice voice!\"\nHe was really worried about Prince and Kratia too, but with Jin and Arema fighting against the Annihilation Flame Sword God, he should have enough time. Moreover, Kratia had harmonized with her orb, temporarily boosting her abilities above their limit, so she wouldn’t die, regardless of how the situation progressed.\n\"Uuuuaaaaaaah!\"\n’I have to focus on saving this old lady now.’\nLee Shin Woo observed the disparate energy deep within her and his expression soured. He’d learned three innate elements, so he’d thought it would be easy to save her, but things were a lot different from what he’d expected.\n\"Seagald, you bastard.\"\nSeagald hadn’t killed his sister just because he was a crazy bastard.\nHe inflicted a grievous injury onto Seira and had simultaneously infused Annihilation Flame into her. The Annihilation Flame and the undead curse, which would transform one into the undead depending on how close they were to death, had overlapped and had become something else entirely. And that was...\n’Anti-Skull...?’\nThat’s right. He thought he’d felt this energy before, but it was similar to Seagald Von Retadane’s mana. In other words, this was a ceremony that turned someone into a member of Anti-Skull. Seagald had attempted to kill his sister and induct her into Anti-Skull!\nHe said something about ’losing her way’ or that he’d ’show her the right path’, but how could Anti-Skull be the right path!? He was willing to go so far as to kill his own little sister to ensure that she was on his side!?\n’As I thought, all these undead bastards are crazy! ...But wait a sec.’\nBut as the different energies interfered with each other, Lee Shin Woo came to another realization. The Annihilation Flame element had eliminated a portion of the undead curse’s mana and had changed its inherent properties, creating something entirely new... It was similar to his Pauls’ mana. He felt as though he was struck by lightning when he came to a realization.\n’Was the reason they came into contact with the Pauls to perfect the Anti-Skull experiment...? So I’m the reason Anti-Skull was perfected?’\nHis Pauls had told him that they’d met with Seagald, yet they had left unscathed. If that’s the case, then why did they come into contact with Pauls that weren’t under the direct command of the Heaven Defying General? It made sense if they were used as data to perfect the Anti-Skull test.\nIf that’s the case, then was the reason Seagald chose now to act because he’d gotten inspiration from the way Lee Shin Woo created the Pauls and managed to complete the Anti-Skull test? So he’d led his own little sister to Bayran, and had even led the other forces here to cause chaos!\n\"Guuuuu. Huaaaaaaah!\"\n\"If you were smart enough to make that call, then you should’ve just told your little sister how to live. You may have copied my methods, but at the end of the day, you’re still undead...!\"\nOnce he understood Seira’s condition, he attempted to reverse her condition with each of his innate elements one-by-one.\nHe tried Dark Shadow first. It would’ve been easy if he could sever cause-and-effect, reversing her death, but... He’d somewhat expected this himself, but he wasn’t at the level where he could do that yet. It was similar to bringing a dead person back to life. If he could do this, then he would’ve given Jin a human body already.\nHe tried his Dark Flame next. He wanted to ’steal’ the curse that ate away at her, but because of what Seagald had done, her mana, the undead curse, and Seagald’s Annihilation Flame element were mixing together and becoming something else entirely. Unless he stole all of her mana, there was nothing he could do.\nIf he were to steal all of her mana, she would vanish without a trace. The Shining Flame was also out of the question using the same logic.\n’What about light? Eh, this won’t work either. Seagald’s Annihilation Flame element devoured Seira’s light and actually became stronger. He prepared this specifically for Seira... Though my darkness should work.’\nSo long as the curse was, at its core, based on the darkness element, it had no choice but to be controlled by it. Lee Shin Woo had already achieved peak darkness mastery, and if he linked himself with Seira’s mana, which filled her body to the brim and was bursting, then he could cause her mana to change in a completely different direction!\n...But it would still change her into an undead. He would stop her from becoming a part of Anti-Skull, but would in-turn turn her into an undead like the Pauls.\n’Then... What other options do I have? Sacrifice?’\nIn the past, when he’d saved Ye Jin Jin, he’d gained a skill called Sacrifice due to his karma. It was a skill that allowed him to kill himself to save someone on the brink of death.\nHe’d accumulated 164 lives as if they were mileage, so he decided to test out the skill. But then...\n[The target is changing due to a status ailment. Thus, you cannot target them with this skill.]\n\"How can you call this a status ailment!? You said I could save someone on the brink of death! She’s clearly dying! So does it only work when they’re dying from something physical!? A case like that’d be hard to find. What a shitty skill!\"\n\"Uuuaaah!\"\nAs expected of Anti-Skull’s leader. Lee Shin Woo had mastered several abilities, yet even he was hard-pressed to deal with this.\nThen again, it was because Seagald was this skilled that he was able to free the undead from the curse and turn them into Anti-Skull in the first place! He was so skilled that it pissed Lee Shin Woo off!\n’...Alright. Let’s give up on saving her. Granny, you lived a long life.’\nHe boldly decided to give up on her. Plus, he didn’t really cherish her enough to risk his life to save her. He just thought that it’d be better to save her. But because it wouldn’t work, he had to give up on it!\nBut if he just left her like this, she would definitely become a powerful ally to Seagald in the future (for a level 8, she didn’t seem like much, but she might get stronger as an undead), so rather than let that happen, it would be better to kill her here and now.\nAnd if it were possible, then...\n\"Sseup. What should I do with you...\"\n\"Uuuaaaah.\"\nEven now, Seira was doing her best to resist the transformation, but her screams were getting louder and louder. The Annihilation Flame element, which was attempting to remake her, the undead curse, which had undergone a special evolution that made it more offensive, and her own mana, which wasn’t capable of mounting a proper resistance and was being influenced by the two...\n’Why did he have to pierce her heart, not only infusing his Annihilation Flame element into her, but also contaminating all of her veins and arteries. ...This bastard. He even anticipated my intervention.’\nMoreover, Seira was the hero that had operated in the Underground Empire the longest, so she had accumulated the most of the undead curse within her body. All those factors worked together to cause the worst possible outcome.\nIn any case, she wouldn’t last long. Her body wouldn’t survive, so he had to make a decision fast. ...In the end, he only really had one option.\n’I guess I have no choice. I have to do it.’\n\"Geuk. Gureureureuuuuu...!\"\nLee Shin Woo extended his hand with a truly regretful expression and placed it upon her chest wound. His hand emitted a deep darkness and was absorbed into her wound; at the same time, he took hold of her seizing body.\nEventually, the darkness spread, taking hold over their surroundings as well! Lee Shin Woo wasn’t aware of this, but time slowed within this space.\n\"Alright. Let’s talk first. It won’t be too late to make a decision afterwards.\"\nBecause of the shock to her mind and body, it was impossible to hold a proper conversation with her. However, if he were to connect them together with his darkness element, then he would be able to talk to her mentally, like how he talked to Jin or his subordinates.\n[Undead! Get away from me this instant!]\nHe succeeded in his attempt. She didn’t scream; rather, he could feel her intent. Although it wasn’t very kind to him.\n[You’re no longer alive, either. You’ll become an undead soon. You’ll be together with your older brother. Aren’t you happy?]\n[I don’t want to... I don’t want to! I don’t want to become an undead!]\nWhy was it that he decided to tease someone endlessly whenever he could? Because of his unnecessary jab, Seira’s seizures intensified noticeably!\n[I’d rather die than become an undead! Kill me! I said kill me!]\n[Then who’ll save the Empire? You were always preaching about God or what not; are you going to abandon your calling as a hero?]\n[Lee Shin Woo will... He’ll save the Empire.]\nLee Shin Woo hesitated. He hadn’t even imagined that she’d bring him up. Is it because she didn’t need to hesitate and could just speak her mind? Like always, she continued with a lengthy speech.\n[I regret not being able to take down the Emperor and my older brother with my own hands, but he should be able to stop them.]\n[He’s still only level 8.]\n[He’s different from me, and the other heroes. Unlike me, who indiscriminately hates the undead due to the undead curse, he considers even the undead as chess pieces. He’ll do everything in his power to completely destroy the Underground Empire...!]\nNo way. She’d unexpectedly assessed him perfectly!? Lee Shin Woo had no intention of dating her or something as frivolous as that, but he didn’t think she had such a favorable opinion of him!\n[An undead’s existence is wrong. And the Underground Empire is even worse, as they’re attempting to use their strength to take over the surface as well. It was my fate to stop them from leaving the underground, but... It’s fine now since Lee Shin Woo is there. So just kill me, Undead.]\n[It seems like you know a part of the truth. If you know why they’re trying to invade the surface, then why didn’t you join them?]\n[I hate the surface too, but...!]\n[Ooh, as I thought.]\nLee Shin Woo was actually having a lot of fun right now. Seira, who had hidden all of her feelings before, was pouring her heart and soul out to Lee Shin Woo. He just regretted that he didn’t have a bowl of popcorn with him.\n[I hate them. The Emperor who banished us underground and the God who abandoned us! But if, in the process of escaping to the surface, it means that we have to hurt innocent people on the surface and he has to put his little sister’s close friend and his fiance into such a miserable state, then... I’d rather bury the Empire and its empty greed, so that humanity can live on!]\n[Fiance...? Ah, the princess was Seagald’s fiance, huh. I understand.]\nLee Shin Woo decided to reflect on his statement of Seira being an insane woman. She was definitely insane, but she was still a hero who had her own thoughts and feelings. ...Was there some hope here?\n[If that’s the case, then you don’t hate the undead. You hate the undead curse, and the Undead Emperor’s forces, who seek to invade the surface. Why do you hate even me, who is against them and seeks to destroy the undead curse? Think calmly. Can’t we become friends?]\n[The undead curse... Ah, now that I’ve become neither dead nor alive, I can say this clearly. ...That I can never join hands with the undead!]\n[Seriously, why not?] New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on novel fire.net\nSeira seized once more. Her own mana, light, the undead curse, and the Annihilation Flame element mixed together, causing a reaction between them and blazed violently. If Lee Shin Woo’s darkness element hadn’t blended into it and hadn’t kept her stable, then she would’ve already turned into a member of Anti-Skull.\n[There are no undead free of the undead curse! Even my older brother, who searched for a way to resist it for dozens of years, stabbed my chest! My older brother, who could wield the light better than anyone else, was unable to avoid the effects of the curse, so no one can escape its effects! We have to bury everything, so that nothing comes out. That’s the only way the world can continue on!]\n[Is that really what you think?]\n[Yes! So now, please... If you’re truly cooperating with Lee Shin Woo, then... If you’re even acting as though you are, then just kill me! I said, kill me!]\n[Unfortunately...]\nLee Shin Woo unleashed even more darkness, forcing a connection between them, and for the first time, the Annihilation Flame element began to wane. The undead curse, which had mutated and was eating away at her, instantaneously lost its strength, and Seira’s own light mana and Lee Shin Woo’s darkness mixed together and became murky.\nThis was the start of their ’contract’.\n[I can’t just let you go like this, Senior.]\n[What... L-Lee Shin Woo?]\nIt hadn’t lasted very long, but their face-to-face talk had at least come to an end.\nLee Shin Woo made his decision. He would make this troublesome granny into his ally... Into an undead.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 46 part5",
    "content": "<Chapter 46. Death’s Companion - 5 [End of Volume 11]>\n[This is... a contract. Contract mana?]\n[Exactly. It’s the most peaceful of the darkness element’s powers.]\n[These memories... Kuheuk!]\nWhat Lee Shin Woo had done was simple. He had increased the darkness between himself and Seira, and had used the most fundamental feature of the darkness element, the ’contract’.\nThey would be connected together, so in a lot of ways, it was a really convenient ability to use. But there was a condition automatically added to a contract: that one cannot lie during the contract process.\nAnd he used that fact to quickly and concisely relay some truthful information to her regarding himself. Telling her who he was, why he looked like this, what he had been doing thus far, as well as what he wanted to do from now on.\nAnd what she wanted to do.\n[How did you...? Why... Ah!]\n[There’s no point in giving you the long story. You don’t have that kind of time anyway. You know that I’m not lying to you. Since a contract is sacred.]\nLee Shin Woo was capable of violating the contract through his Dark Shadow and Wild Card skills, but it was unnecessary to tell her that. In any case, what he was relaying to her were... only truthful memories of his past.\n[Keuk. How did this happen...!?]\n[You can do stuff like this when you reach peak mastery of an element. You pretty much understand now, right?]\n[I can’t believe it! But still... Why would God!?]\n[Want me to ask your older sister? Moreover, I already told you why she did it. Everyone else did fail, and I’m close to clearing the mission. No... you said it yourself. That you’ll leave everything to me. So don’t go dying and leaving everything to me. It pisses me off.]\n[Keut!]\nLee Shin Woo could feel her anguish quite clearly. If she were still alive, then she would’ve gone completely nuts after hearing his story. Since she couldn’t restrain her deep-seated hatred of the undead.\nBut she was dying right now; her life as a human being was already over, and she was progressively turning into an undead. That’s why she could assess the situation ’calmly’. And she realized that everything Lee Shin Woo had been saying was true.\n...No, she had actually realized before then.\n[Perhaps... I had my suspicions. That you might be the Heaven Defying General himself... If that were true, then it would explain all of my questions and all of your secrets. But I thought it was impossible. Since there was no way I would confuse a human with an undead! Since there was no way that you, who personified a hero who only showed up in stories... could be an undead!]\n[My acting was great, right? If I was honest and told my seniors that I was an undead, then they’d either try to kill me or attack me, so I couldn’t tell them the truth.]\n[Ah, I trusted you... I thought a human that could completely purify the Empire had finally appeared.]\nHer voice sounded lost, as if she were wandering through fog. He heard her bewilderment, and happily thought that he was indeed not normal.\nHowever, he couldn’t help being happy! It was so sweet; watching a woman who’d held on with only her belief as that belief shattered in front of her!\n[I am planning on killing them all. And it doesn’t really matter whether someone’s dead or alive.]\n[How can you say that so nonchalantly? How... How are you unaffected by the undead curse?]\n[God’s the one who made me like this. ...Isn’t it because I have Darkness Resistance? The reason your older brother’s relatively sane is because of the light element. On the contrary, it’s more unbelievable that you were able to wield the light element with such ease. ...Though I’ve pretty much figured out why.]\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t the only one who revealed things about himself. Seira also had to reveal her past or whatever her feelings were.\n[Don’t snoop around someone’s thoughts as you please.]\n[I just shared some basic information for the contract.]\n[Easy for you to say! To think that you were this kind of person!]\n[I’m not a human, I’m a skeleton.]\n[Kuuuuuu! I hate you!]\nShe was deeply affected by the curse not only because of how long she’d been down here, but also because she somewhat knew why the Underground Empire had turned out like this.\nThe Emperor and Seagald, as well as the countless citizens of the Underground Empire... It was because of their greed and their obsession that lead the Empire to ruin. She had hated them from the very beginning. Thus, her hatred towards the undead was greater than anyone’s, so much so that it devolved into madness.\n[But now you know. That there was an undead that stood against them from the very beginning. And that you can also become like that too.]\n[I can’t believe it. I can’t believe it...!]\n[Stop throwing a tantrum. If this goes on any further, then I won’t be able to do anything for you anymore. You’ll become a part of Anti-Skull. Considering the Annihilation Flame’s effects on you and the curse, you’ll become one of the top members of Anti-Skull... There’s a high chance that you’ll become unconditionally loyal to General Seagald.]\nTheir discussion of whether she wanted to form a contract with him and become an undead, or become a part of Anti-Skull and follow Seagald, was perhaps quite laughable.\nBut at the very least, she shared a common goal with him, and he didn’t really care what happened to her after that mutual goal was achieved.\nWhereas, Lee Shin Woo didn’t know what Seagald’s goal was. He had no idea whether Seagald’s goals differed or aligned with the Emperor’s. But he did know that Anti-Skull was filled with psychos. He thought talking to her would be a pain while she was still alive, so he’d also thought about killing her, turning her into an undead, and then talking to her!\n’I should’ve just killed her and taken her bones.’\n...It might not be so different. Lee Shin Woo did his best to ensure that these thoughts remained hidden from Seira. He didn’t know if she knew what he was thinking, but she was still struggling to make her choice.\n[So kill me before I become like that...!]\n[You don’t want revenge? You hated the undead so much. I can give you another chance, but you’re just going to run away?]\n[But I’ll have to become an undead!]\nLee Shin Woo had been really curious about something and decided to ask. Perhaps it was more of a question to himself, who could define himself however he wished.\n[If you yourself don’t believe anything has changed about you, then what’s the difference whether you’re an undead or not? Are you taking some sort of regular qualifying examination or something? If not, then is it because the undead can’t kill other undead? Or is it because undead can’t fight for humanity?]\n[I... I...!]\n[You’re just bias towards the undead. You don’t understand even after looking at me? No, you just don’t want to accept it, right? That’s what you call being stubborn.]\n[Keuk...!]\nHe wished she’d just agree already. Just undergoing the contract process allowed him to see about half her thoughts. Lee Shin Woo was getting frustrated and asked curtly.\n[Do you want to live?]\n[...I do! I do, but...!]\n[Then there’s your answer. Contract established.]\nHe didn’t have any more time to waste with her. He still had some precious comrades of his to save. Lee Shin Woo firmly declared.\n[Then live. Think about the rest later.]\n[Hey, wait. No, this... Geuk. Guaaaaaaaah!]\nThus far, she had only experienced superficial pain. Because her own mana had been resisting the ambient mana, she hadn’t turned into an undead.\nBut once he finished speaking, the undead curse, the light, Annihilation Flame, and his mana equally covered her, initiating the change.\nDeath had given her a kiss and passed by. And the next stage had come right after.\n[You’re just going to change a little bit.]\n[Guaaaaaaaah!]\nSeira screamed however, at the changes her body and soul were undergoing. The white light and the jet-black darkness entwined together and began to change her body and soul.\n[Giiiiiiiik!]\n[Oh, she’s changing quite a bit.]\nLee Shin Woo just watched vacantly as she let out her horrific screams, and enjoyed the fact that the mana explosion was more intense than he’d expected.\n’Ah, maybe it’s more intense because she could originally use light?’\nThe undead opposed light. Thus, Seagald Von Retadane, who possessed the light element, could act in opposition to his instincts as an undead... But at the same time, the process of becoming an undead must’ve been quite difficult for him.\nSo, Lee Shin Woo was relieved that he was supervising her undead transformation himself. He was an undead and the possessor of both the light and darkness elements, so he knew how to handle them so that they wouldn’t oppose each other. He controlled the flow of mana that was changing her calmly and meticulously.\n[Aaah...!]\n[Calmly follow me. Calmly.]\n[Ugh...]\nIt was a mysterious experience. It felt like he was creating Seira’s new body. And ’in order to live’, Seira followed his instructions and moved her mana accordingly. Her human body, which had endured over several years, broke apart naturally and her mana began to construct a new body for her.\nIt was more powerful than her old one and ironically, possessed more life force and magic than before. Like when Jin had reached level 8, Lee Shin Woo used all of his innate abilities to create the body Seira wanted. Orıginal content can be found at novel✶fire.net\n’...Good. It’s going well. She really is beautiful.’\nFortunately, her starting point was really good, so he was able to create a new body for her without her physical appearance/features changing much. Her accumulated karma, her inventory, and her Perium must’ve had an effect on her.\n[Aaaaaaaaaaah!]\nThe equipment she’d been wearing broke apart. In exchange, her naked body was covered by a deep gray dress. It was far greater than any equipment she’d worn in the past!\nLee Shin Woo felt it was actually something you would wear at a funeral, but it was indeed quite beautiful.\n\"Alright. We’re all done.\"\n\"Ah. Ah...?\"\nCould he call her an undead right now... It was hard to answer. In terms of her dying and coming back, she was indeed an undead, but he couldn’t really say what the difference between her past body and her current body was.\nHer light element had remained unchanged, and was actually more powerful than before. In the process of destroying the Annihilation Flame’s mana, a part of that mana was analyzed and imbued to her. Lee Shin Woo was the same.\nWhat’s worse, he had used his darkness after Seagald’s attempt at converting her. Because Lee Shin Woo had gone after Seagald’s clumsy attempt, Seira had become even more powerful than expected. Or, at least in terms of pure power.\n[The Lv8 Undead Banshee Princess Seira has been born and has entered a subordinate contract with you.]\n[You have analyzed another fusion element of light and fire. The High Rank Light element has become Lv6 and Magic has increased by 20. The High Rank Fire element has become Lv7 and Magic has increased by 20. The Beginner Shining Flame element has become Lv6 and Magic has increased by 20.]\n[You have acquired a similarly leveled powerful subordinate. The High Rank Command skill has become Lv9 and all stats have increased by 5.]\nAfter everything was over and Lee Shin Woo had checked his messages, he took a look at Seira and smiled bitterly. A banshee, huh. That was truly...\n\"A Banshee... It really does fit you.\"\n\"Aaaaaah! Aaaaaah!\"\nSeira had finally become a new entity, but it seemed as though she couldn’t accept reality, as she continued screaming. As she cried, her eyes and her hair had, at some point, burned and turned into a dark gray, like used-up charcoal.\n\"I guess this is where you cry for a while. I understand. But you’ll get in my way, so let’s talk later.\"\n\"I don’t understand...! I don’t understand anything. Why! You!\"\n\"Yeah, yeah. You’re going through puberty. I understand.\"\nLee Shin Woo thought of her as a young girl going through puberty! He waved his hand and the Heaven Door’s Key activated and sucked her in. Where did she go? That was something only Lee Shin Woo and Seira knew.\n\"Alright. Now that the urgent stuff has been taken care of...\"\n\"Shin Woo!\"\n’You’re mine, level 8 Banshee!’ he said, as if he were a Pokemon trainer, and then turned around. He saw Jin coming towards him. Fortunately, she was safe, but it seemed like she wouldn’t be if things went on for just a little while longer.\n\"Come over here. At this rate, we’ll all die!\"\n\"...A-Alright. I got it. Sorry about that.\"\n\"Just hurry up!\"\nLee Shin Woo was, of course, not given any time to rest. He got atop Jin’s back to fight against Seagald.",

    "content": "<Chapter 47. We Got a New Colleague! - 1>\nPrince looked around, dumbstruck. Everything had gone well since they’d separated from Lee Shin Woo and entered the center of the city, so she didn’t know how things had all gone to hell.\n\"It’s a mess!\"\n\"Agreed.\"\nWhat was with that huge ass cannon and the Spirit General tied in the middle of it? Putting aside the Archmage, who had appeared and summoned a ton of monsters as if waiting for them, why was the Annihilation Flame Sword God fighting against Seira (they had expected her to go wild, as if she were a crazed woman, so they weren’t as surprised)? And where had Lee Shin Woo gone; the Heaven Defying General was supposedly helping him clean up the city, yet why had the Heaven Defying General shown up with the Metal God General, rather than him!?\n\"Kratia, there are so many level 8s rampaging about. What can we even do?\"\n\"There’s nothing we can do for now, Prince. Bring out the popcorn.\"\nLee Shin Woo had driven off the Lich, but the countless monsters he’d summoned still filled the battlefield. The golems and the Chi Pauls were diligently cutting down their numbers, but there were still so many of them that Kratia and Prince had a hard time dealing with all of them swarming the area.\nIf the Archmage could summon an endless supply of monsters, then he could defeat any army. This was the true power of the Empire! The Archmage had already disappeared, but their fear of him hadn’t.\n\"Popcorn? I don’t know what that is!\"\n\"I don’t really know what it is either. Shin Woo told me that it’s something you eat when there’s nothing you can do.\"\n\"Ugh. So where did my Junior go anyway...?\"\n\"Shin Woo is...\"\nKratia set her orb in the shape of an ice spear and cut apart the monsters nearby, then briefly looked at Lee Shin Woo who had appeared beyond them.\nLee Shin Woo had grabbed onto Seira Von Retadane, whose heart had been pierced by the Empire’s strongest general and was trying to do something. That’s what she saw, but... she felt like even someone as exceptional as Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t be able to save someone with a pierced heart. Prince asked another question as if she’d noticed where Kratia was looking. For more chapters visıt novelꜰire.net\n\"And seriously, what is that? Is he really on our side? He seems like he’s trying to help us. It really does seem like he’s helping Seira! Why? Why is an undead helping us?\"\n\"...I think we’ll find out soon enough.\"\n\"Wait a sec. Do you know something? What did you do as you traveled with my Junior!? Uaaah. I can’t stand it; there’s so much I don’t know! Fire Demon!\"\nPrince’s mana responded to her cry of pent-up frustration and manifested a fire demon onto the battlefield once more. Through Kratia’s special training, she had succeeded in modifying her summoning magic, which had been passed down through her family. Because of that, she was able to summon the fire demon without cross-dressing!\n[Kuoooooh!]\nThe Fire Demon was more powerful than before, yet the mana consumption was lower. This was all due to Kratia’s help in fixing the structure of her summoning magic.\nThe unnecessary formulas that had been added as it was passed along were removed, and a more efficient magic formula was added through Kratia’s in-depth knowledge of another world’s magic. Thus, she could bring out the Fire Demon’s maximum power. And with this, Prince now possessed power befitting a level 7 magician.\n\"I thought I’d gotten stronger, but... Ah, this is crazy!\"\n[Kuhaaaaaah!]\nOf course, Prince was plenty strong, as she possessed magic befitting her level and also had her family’s secret art. It was just that the people here were the most powerful individuals in the Empire!\nAll the more reason why she couldn’t stand it. The only way she could further develop was through time. Lloyd and Erian seemed relaxed, as they weren’t aware of this, but Prince knew. That there would soon be a battle that would determine the fate of the Empire! She couldn’t afford to just lollygag around, especially if she wanted to do even a little bit more during that climactic battle...\n\"Prince.\"\n\"What!?\"\nThen, Kratia called Prince with her usual calm and composed voice. Prince yelled sharply in response and turned around, but noticed that Kratia was pointing at a certain spot.\n\"Look at that.\"\n\"The Spirit General? I saw her before. She didn’t seem like she’d be an immediate threat... or that’s what I thought, but what’s with her?\"\n[Giiiiiii. Gyauaaaaaaah!]\nJust a little while ago, the Spirit General remained tied on the cannon, but now, she was letting out bizarre cries and was twisting her body around. The cannon responded in kind; her struggle caused the cannon’s accumulated mana to struggle as well.\nIt had already been tense, but that tension had risen instantaneously. Why were they tense? They felt as though the cannon’s mana would burst forth and evaporate everything in the area!\n\"If all of the undead curse within it explodes, then... We’ll definitely become undead, right?\"\n\"We’ll be lucky to retain our forms as undead. There’s a high chance we’ll be broken down on an atomic level and disappear.\"\n\"Don’t say something like that! Why did it become like that?\"\n\"...There’s a high chance it’s the Archmage’s doing. When the Archmage’s body was destroyed by Shin... The Heaven Defying General, he must’ve given the Spirit General an order. It was probably a forceful activation.\"\nKratia was right on the mark. Ever since the level 8 Spirit General was tied to the cannon, the palace became capable of forcing orders upon her. And that authority was also given to the Archmage as well.\nAnd when he’d been defeated by Lee Shin Woo, he ordered the Spirit General to fire, in order to eliminate all that threatened the Empire in one fell swoop. It was regrettable that the royal family would lose such a powerful weapon, but if the Annihilation Flame Sword God, the Metal God General, and the Heaven Defying General were to all die here, then the Emperor would have no other enemies remaining!\n\"...We have to stop it.\"\nKratia saw the Metal God General and Jin fight against the Annihilation Flame Sword God, as well as Lee Shin Woo struggling to keep Seira alive, and nodded her head as if she’d made a hard decision.\n\"How?\"\n\"Let’s freeze her for now. If we stop the progress in its tracks, then Shin Woo will take care of the rest.\"\n\"I shouldn’t be saying this, but aren’t you depending on my Junior a bit too much...?\"\n\"We’re partners. ...Open a path, Prince.\"\n\"Tch. Easy for you to say!\"\n’If it was so easy, then I would’ve done it already’, she wanted to say, but she raised her hands anyway so that she could fulfill Kratia’s request. Then... a section of the nearby monsters vanished and the Chi Pauls appeared.\n[We’ll assist you, as per Lord Paul Zero’s orders. I assume we have to stop that woman, right?]\n\"Yeah. Please.\"\n\"Uh...\"\n[Got it.]\nOnce they met, Prince opened her eyes wide. Although she should’ve hated the undead, she didn’t really bare any hostility towards these chimeras.\nA part of it was that the Chi Pauls had grown such that they could hide their death energy, but it was more that Prince had undergone a fundamental change. She couldn’t understand it herself and looked on dumbfounded; the Chi Pauls just ignored her and charged forward. Their bodies were veiled in flames.\n[This is the power that Lord Paul Zero bestowed upon us. Kill all those who go against him!]\n[Uoooooooh!]\n[Open a path. This is the order he gave us!]\n[Kuoooh!]\nThe Chimera Avengers charged, veiled in at least level 5 intermediate flames. Though the monsters were no pushovers, they could not withstand the Chi Pauls’ might and just burned away. Prince watched them and briefly hesitated, but... She soon bit her lip and extended her hand towards them.\n\"Fire Demon. Become their flame!\"\nHer spell just looked like a summon but it was more of an amalgamation of her family’s will and mana.\nIf she could control that will freely, then it didn’t matter how the fire demon was manifested. And Prince, who possessed high proficiency in the spell, could share the fire demon’s power with others! The Fire Demon followed her will and was absorbed by the Chi Pauls, strengthening their flames to its utmost.\n[What tremendous heat... Alright, we’re quickening our pace!]\n[Follow me!]\n\"Good job, Prince.\"\n\"Hmph. Seira’s already shown me what happens when you go crazy over the undead, so I can’t do something stupid after seeing that.\"\nYeah, that’s right. Perhaps the reason Prince could remain so calm in spite of all this was because she’d seen how stupid Retadane had acted. While she nodded in understanding, Kratia gripped her Orb with both hands and infused her mana into it; at the same time, she began casting.\n\"It is through the Winter Queen’s grace that all creation remains in place. Her breath freezes blood and covers the skin with snow...\"\n\"You should’ve told me in advance, you bad...\"\nAlthough the Chi Pauls were tearing through the monsters, the two of them weren’t safe. Prince maintained her spell, reinforcing herself and the Chi Pauls, but also cast another spell to protect her and Kratia.\nFortunately, the Chi Pauls, strengthened by her Fire Demon, had brought them to the cannon before her barrier was broken. The Spirit General’s struggles intensified, and even now, the vibrations of the cannon’s accumulated magic was shaking their collars.\n\"It’ll really blow. Hurry up and do something, Kratia!\"\n\"I’m done! Absolute Freeze!\"\nKratia extended both her hands and forcefully threw her Orb! The Orb broke into pieces midair, transforming into countless ice crystals, and rushed towards the Spirit General.\nThe monsters attempted to stop her, but the Chi Pauls and Prince stopped them in their tracks, allowing her spell to go unhindered and freeze the Spirit General. She had put everything she had into that spell, freezing both the Spirit General’s movements and even her mana at the same time!\n[Aaaaaah. Guaaaaaaaah!]\n\"Keuk. She’s resisting... Prince, give me your magic!\"\n\"Yeah, sure. Here, take it all why don’t you!\"\nAs a result of their special training, the two could now transfer mana to each other.\nKratia took all of Prince’s mana without leaving a single drop, converted it into ice, and used it on the Spirit General. Although the Spirit General was a level 8, she was just an empty doll following orders, so she couldn’t properly resist Kratia’s high rank spell. Her movements were completely restricted. The flow of her exploding mana slightly ever so slightly calmed down.\n\"Did it work!?\"\n\"You just jinxed it, Prince.\"\n\"Why!?\"\nBoth Prince and Kratia were exhausted, as if they’d fall over on the spot. Although they were breathing heavily, they still joked around. She didn’t actually think it would fail.\nKratia’s spell had been perfect, and the Spirit General’s mana had been completely restrained. So long as the Archmage didn’t come back, she wouldn’t be able to break through it...!\n[Impressive spell, Hero. Because of you, I can use this weapon more easily than before.]\nPrince just had to jinx it. They then saw the Annihilation Flame Sword God atop the cannon. Though his armor was in tatters and rotten white blood flowed from his body, he seemed like he had energy to spare.\nPrince immediately searched for any traces of the Metal God General... found him injured on the ground and sighed. She didn’t know why he had helped them, but he wasn’t able to prevent Seira’s death or restrain the Annihilation Flame Sword God. He was completely useless!\n[I thought I’d have to do much more but to think you used such an impressive magic formula to restrain her. You would be a good fit in Anti-Skull.]\n\"Regrettably, I already have a previous engagement after I die.\"\nKratia declared firmly, even in the midst of the Annihilation Flame Sword God’s overwhelming pressure. He seemed even more taken by her grit, as he smiled.\n[Is that so? You’ll probably change your mind once you die. Like my little sister did...]\n\"Your little sister isn’t here anymore.\"\n[Keok!?]\nThe Annihilation Flame Sword God fell from the cannon. In his stead, Lee Shin Woo and Jin had appeared. Jin had brought him here at just the right time!\n[Wait, my little sister is...!?]\nThe Annihilation Flame Sword God barely recovered from a light-speed kick, looked around, and yelled in shock. Of course, Seira could no longer be seen on the battlefield, as Lee Shin Woo had sent her away with his Heaven Door’s Key.\nThe Annihilation Flame Sword God probably had no idea what had happened to her. Since he still didn’t completely comprehend the Heaven Defying General’s power!\n[...What did you do with my little sister?]\n\"Your little sister died, just as you wanted. I couldn’t save her, no matter what I did. ...Though I’m not so sure your little sister will be yours after death.\"\nLee Shin Woo said angrily and gripped his Death God’s Shining Bone Sword. There was an incredible amount of mana within. It was a fitting weapon to use against the Annihilation Flame Sword God.\n\"But that’s all. Don’t think you can just make a mess on my stage and leave as you please, Seagald Von Retadane.\"\n[I can’t just leave. Since there’s still something I want.]\nThe Annihilation Flame Sword God smiled and gripped his own sword. His Annihilation Flame blazed and his presence was erased from the world once more. In a sense, he was stronger than the Garuda... Lee Shin Woo gritted his teeth and charged at him.\nThe impact between Annihilation Flame and Dark Shadow boomed, resounding far and wide as if signaling the start of their battle.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 47 part2",
    "content": "<Chapter 47. We Got a New Colleague! - 2>\n[Too shallow.]\nSeagald declared.\n[You’ve learned some good skills and accumulated some experience as well. But that’s all. You don’t have the basics down, so everything you do is sloppy.]\n[Shut up.]\nLee Shin Woo and Seagald’s blades clashed in the air and erupted in intense flames. No, that’s what he thought, but... At that moment, Seagald’s sword was coming for Lee Shin Woo’s helmet. If he hadn’t responded with his darkness and stopped it, then the battle would’ve been decided right then and there.\n[And only your elements are strong. But do you know something? That your mana, which you thought was infinite when you reached level 8, will eventually run out. I wonder how much energy and mana you had to waste to block my attack? You can only attain victory after you’ve calculated and distributed your power.]\nThe problem was that this had been repeated a few times already.\n’I had an inkling, but this guy...’\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t a good match for him. The fact that he was skilled in the light element wasn’t the issue. The problem was his innate element, the Annihilation Flame.\nThe Annihilation Flame was a technique that erased oneself. It looked as convoluted as Lee Shin Woo’s innate elements, but it was actually quite simple. It would act as if you weren’t there, even if you were. Conversely, it would seem as if you were there, even if you weren’t. In other words, it was fundamentally similar to Lee Shin Woo: it was based on trickery!\n’They’re similar, but oppose each other.’\nAnnihilation Flame was, in a sense, the greatest stealth tool at a glance. The user could erase only a select part of themselves and fool their opponent; and during that time, they can do whatever they wish.\nHe had fooled Lee Shin Woo into thinking that their swords would clash, but he was actually aiming for Lee Shin Woo’s helmet. He must’ve erased ’truth’. It really was a pain in the ass to face in CQC. But if he widened the distance between them, Seagald would attack his allies. It was really a frustrating situation.\n’He never had any intention of walking atop my stage.’\nWild Card was a skill that could lead him to certain victory only if he knew everything there was to know about his opponent. However, Seagald kept erasing himself from Lee Shin Woo’s stage, which made it difficult to ascertain what was real.\nEven now, Seagald was acting as though they were fighting face-to-face, but... That probably wasn’t real. His goal wasn’t to kill Lee Shin Woo but to control the cannon. He wanted to find an opportunity to use the cannon.\n[If you look away, you’ll die!]\n[Hah, you’re quite sharp!]\n...If that’s the case. Lee Shin Woo swung his sword, imbuing his sword with his Dark Flame. Dark Shadow’s level was still too low, so it couldn’t fend off Seagald’s Annihilation Flame. However, Dark Flame would weaken Seagald’s flames whenever their swords clashed!\nAnd that’s exactly what happened. The moment their swords clashed, the Dark Flame mixed with the Annihilation Flame, creating a new current that Seagald wasn’t aware of. Seagald’s power was really a good match for his Wild Card skill...! Lee Shin Woo inwardly smiled and thrust his sword once more.\n[Ha!]\n[Keuk. This is...?]\nAfter that brief exchange, Lee Shin Woo had, for the first time, broken Seagald’s shoulder armor. Lee Shin Woo’s lie and Seagald’s lie had resonated, which ultimately confused Seagald. Seagald knew that Lee Shin Woo had used his power against him, and he was even more flustered because of it.\nLee Shin Woo had gained the upper hand and continued with the resonance of their elements. Dark Flame with lightning, Annihilation Flame with ice, and finally, Lee Shin Woo was able to grasp Seagald’s true body.\nHe broke Seagald’s armor, the broken pieces fluttering in the wind. Seagald quickly used his Annihilation Flame to avoid the attack and looked at Lee Shin Woo.\n[...Is it a stealing ability?]\n[Hmm, I wonder. I may just be fooling you.]\n[Ha. Its power befitting the title of ’Heaven Defying’! Did you force all your opponents into this kind of situation?] ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ novel·fire.net\nSeagald did his best to act calm and reply nonchalantly but was quickly doing some calculations in his head. His opponent’s special ability was on par with, or perhaps even greater than his own! However, he was still superior when it came to basic combat abilities.\nIf that’s the case, then if he were to attack him such that he couldn’t defend and then take that opportunity to control the cannon, then... No, he couldn’t ignore the level 7 elite magician, flaming chimeras, and the golems, who were just waiting for their opportunity to strike.\n’If it was all going according to plan, then those golems would’ve been on my side, but... Tarian, you idiot. They figured out what your true intentions were. That much is obvious, since he’s not with them. Ah, Tarian. You made things so much harder for me!’\nThe inside of his head was becoming quite busy. But there was still a way out of this. He knew there was a chance that a single squad wouldn’t be able to accomplish its mission, so he had some reserve troops stationed nearby.\nHe had ordered them to advance after taking care of all the traps, so they should join the battlefield soon. And when they do, there’ll be chaos. If he were to use that chaos to subdue the Heaven Defying General and then take control of the cannon, then he’d be able to achieve his goal!\n...But the only problem was that they were quite delayed.\n[Tch...]\n[Your sword’s become restless. That creates an opening!]\n[Everything you say pisses me off!]\nWhereas Lee Shin Woo was seething; he couldn’t even defeat Seagald when he was diverting his attention away from their battle. He wasn’t a match for Seagald in terms of overall stats or fundamental combat abilities, aside from magic; the only reason he was able to match up against him was because Jin balanced out his stats.\nHe pushed back with his innate skills, which were based around magic, but Seagald’s innate element was no pushover. Contrary to Seagald’s expectations, Lee Shin Woo still had plenty of mana left over and could attack as soon as Seagald’s mana bottomed out. However, Seagald was no fool, and he would probably retreat if his mana ran low.\nHe was that skilled. Honestly, his opponent was well-rounded. ...To be more specific, he was kind of like Lee Shin Woo. If just a little bit.\n’A warrior only needs to be good at CQC, so why the hell does he have to use his Annihilation Flame too?’\nHe was one to talk. He knew that, but it pissed him off anyway. Lee Shin Woo might’ve been able to overpower him if his Manatization skill had reached level 5; if his Dark Shadow or Shining Flame were at the intermediate stage, he would’ve also been able to deal with Seagald’s Annihilation Flame with ease and burn his body to a crisp!\n’Acting like you’re the one being pushed back? ...It might work against someone else, but it won’t work on me.’\nAs stated, the Annihilation Flame Sword God’s objective was the cannon. He would act as though he were being pushed back, but if he had the opportunity, he would jump on it and head towards the cannon. The moment Lee Shin Woo gave Seagald the opportunity, it would be game over.\nIf that’s the case, then... since he was out of options, he had no choice but to use his final resort. He summoned all the weapons he’d been saving. Lee Shin Woo gritted his teeth and spoke to his partner.\n’Let’s go, Jin.’\n’Got it.’\nShe knew that the Annihilation Flame Sword God wasn’t to be taken lightly, so she answered seriously and readied herself. Her steel wings fluttered and they rushed towards Seagald like a bullet.\n[Keuk!?]\nAt the same time, a dozen of Lee Shin Woo’s weapons came out from within the surrounding darkness and flew towards Seagald all at once. Lee Shin Woo had been saving these weapons until now! There was no way even Seagald could’ve expected this.\n’Each and every one of them contains a huge amount of mana! What kind of power is this, Heaven Defying General...!?’\nWhat was most frightening about it was that they were all at least level 7. The startled Seagald used his Annihilation Flame and erased himself from that spot.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo had expected him to do so and launched his weapons in all directions. Lee Shin Woo had summoned all of his weapons because he’d expected this prior. He’d experienced Seagald’s Annihilation Flame a few times already, so the moment his weapons touched him, it would become easy to figure out where he was!\n\"Found you...!\"\n[Heaven Defying General...!]\nIn the end, one of the Death God’s Shining Bone Swords found him. It had only pierced his shoulder, but Lee Shin Woo then used the mana accumulated within the Death God’s Shining Bone Sword to use its active skill.\nThe skill’s name was Death God’s Fury. It was a skill that he can only use by infusing a ton of mana into the sword. It would sever any magical or spatial interference and slash anything that was within his vision! It was the best skill to use against Seagald!\n[Kuhahk!?]\n[That’s only the beginning!]\nHe wasn’t sure if Seagald knew or not, but Lee Shin Woo possessed eight other Shining Bone Swords, aside from the one on his person. Moreover, so long as the swords were infused with enough mana, he could keep using the skill to ignore any spatial and magical interference and keep attacking him!\nIt wasn’t just one slash; he was simultaneously hit by seven more slashes. Each and every strike was incredibly powerful, and if Seagald wasn’t a wielder of light, then he would’ve died right then and there.\n[Kuaaaaahk!]\n\"Jin!\"\n\"I know!\"\nThat wasn’t the end. Lee Shin Woo and Jin charged forward, right as the Shining Bone Swords did their job!\nShe turned ridiculously fast once she found her target. Jin stepped on the air, turned her body, kicked off the air once more, and charged towards Seagald! She converted all of her mana into light and put everything she had into her sprint. That was her light. At this very moment, nothing existed that could surpass her speed.\n\"...Tch!\"\nBut once they made contact with Seagald, Lee Shin Woo clicked his tongue. Seagald’s body crumpled from his attack... but he realized that it was just a clump of Annihilation Flame. He wasn’t even a ninja, so what’s with the body replacement technique!?\n\"That bastard ran away.\"\n\"Oh, he really did.\"\nHe might’ve run away once he’d been hit by the Shining Bone Swords. Seagald had realized that he couldn’t defeat Lee Shin Woo with his Annihilation Flame alone and had chosen to retreat.\nSeagald had probably used some sort of escape artifact that activated through the use of his Annihilation Flame. He had even used Wild Card a few times, yet his opponent had still gotten away... How humiliating!\n\"...Should we follow him?\"\n\"He’s gotten quite far away. To think he’d even abandon the troops that had come to save him.\"\nIn case of any reinforcements, Lee Shin Woo had put his Pauls on standby. He got their report and just sighed.\nThey had discovered Anti-Skull beforehand and were engaged in battle. Just recently, they had begun to disperse and retreat. Seagald must’ve ordered their retreat once he’d escaped.\nHe must’ve been sure that Lee Shin Woo would’ve followed him if he were to go and save them personally. As expected... he was quite smart. He really was like Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Chi Paul squad, Anti-Skull is fighting against our forces in the west. Take care of them. Don’t let any of them escape.\"\n[Understood!]\nOnce they received their orders, the Chi Pauls mobilized immediately. Lee Shin Woo cleaned up the rest of the Archmage’s summoned monsters in their stead by blowing up his remaining weapons. In the blink of an eye, the battle was over and the battlefield had become silent.\n[Gu...uuuu...]\nAh, now that he thought about it, it wasn’t entirely over. There was still the Spirit General that needed to be taken care of; she had broken through Kratia’s spell and was twisting her body around in order to execute the Archmage’s order.\nHe had worked so hard, yet he couldn’t rest yet. The Archmage and the Annihilation Flame Sword God had gotten away, but he wasn’t even able to remain pissed in peace!\n\"Hey, you!\"\nHe gritted his teeth, rotated in the air, and approached the Spirit General. Then, Prince raised her staff while shaking and pointed at Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Where did my Junior go! Give him back!\"\n\"...Ha.\"\nKratia sighed deeply and hit the back of her neck. Prince fainted as if she were in a comic book. Normally, one wouldn’t black out from that; Lee Shin Woo looked on vacantly, and Kratia just responded calmly.\n\"Let’s take care of that first and then talk.\"\n\"...Alright.\"\nAll the troublesome people were gone now. He hadn’t figured out what the Annihilation Flame Sword God intended to do with the cannon, but now was the time to deal with the source of all the chaos.",

    "content": "<Chapter 47. We Got a New Colleague! - 3>\n\"Jin, let’s just back off. You don’t think you can absorb all of the undead curse within the cannon, do you?\"\n\"Nope. If it were just her, then I might be able to do something about it, but the curse will flow into her from the cannon anyway, so there’s no point. I’m trying my best here, but it’s too much...\"\n\"Jin, it’s dangerous to absorb it so recklessly. My Stasis Magic will wear off.\"\n\"Ah, that’s right. Kratia, good job.\"\n\"Of course.\"\nHer application of ’first aid’ was top-notch. She didn’t simply freeze her target; she had completely halted the Spirit General from using any of her ’power’, which included both her magic and her physical strength. It felt like she’d used the time element as well.\nPerhaps Lee Shin Woo had been looking down on the ice element thus far. He could wield the Lv1 High Rank Ice element, but that wasn’t something he could boast about in front of Kratia.\n[Guu...Guaaaaah...]\n\"Ah, this woman’s lost it too. Where should I even start...\"\nHer ominous, yet beautiful black hair was disheveled, and her widened, golden eyes evoked a creepy feeling; and the princess continued to cry out.\nLee Shin Woo had, from the very beginning, assumed that she wouldn’t be ’ok’, but her condition was a lot worse than he’d expected.\nAfter all, she had been used as a ’battery’ and an ’energy cable’ for the cannon for dozens of years, which had worn away at both her body and her mind... In other words, the contract had been in place before the fall of the Empire. That’s what had caused her to be in such a sorry state.\n’So he’s willing to use his daughter or anything at his disposal to go to the surface, huh...’\nHe recalled what Seira had said before. That Seagald was willing to use his fiance for his goals... If his goal involved using the cannon, then she was right.\nLee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and placed his hand on the cannon. As expected, he didn’t ’own’ the cannon, so he couldn’t change it into bone.\nHonestly, he’d already tried it before fighting Seagald. It was because he knew that he couldn’t change it into bone that he had been so anxious during his fight. Ah, he was getting pissed again!\n\"Seagald, I’ll kill you no matter what...\"\n\"Shin Woo, you talking like that makes you sound more like an undead.\"\n\"He’s never lost his prey before, but he lost two of them at once, so that’s probably why he’s like that.\"\n\"You were able to drive them away without losing the cannon pretty much unscathed. I feel like that’s a decisive victory in your favor, Shin Woo...\"\nWhereas, Kratia and Jin, who couldn’t do anything more, just calmly conversed and watched on. The golems were standing behind them in order to protect the Metal God General. Kratia glanced at them and then asked Jin.\n\"How did you talk them into this? They’re completely subservient to Shin Woo.\"\n\"He took advantage of their weakness; they’re just helping us out temporarily.\"\n\"...Sounds like something a villain would do.\"\nKratia had no idea how Lee Shin Woo had grasped one of the Four Heavenly Commander’s weaknesses and forced him to do his bidding, but because Jin looked clueless as well, she didn’t ask her anything else. It really didn’t matter, so long as they didn’t come attacking them.\n\"So Shin Woo... do you think it’s impossible?\"\n\"Mm, I have to take care of this woman first. Then I can move on to the next step.\"\n\"...Are you going to brainwash her too?\"\n\"Hey, don’t put it that way. It makes me sound like a weirdo.\"\nAll he was doing was changing her mind a little bit and turning her into a completely different person than before! Lee Shin Woo ignored Kratia’s rude remark and focused on the princess once more. Fortunately, it was much easier to deal with her than Seira.\n’Her contract was forced onto her through the darkness element, so I can easily deal with it. It’s a relief it’s not complicated.’\nLee Shin Woo stretched his hand and placed it upon the princess’s forehead. Darkness covered her, an amount similar to when he’d transformed Seira into a banshee, and he immediately erased the contract that bound her.\n[You don’t need to be tied to the cannon any longer.]\n[You don’t need to listen to the Emperor’s or the Archmage’s orders any longer.]\n[I’m erasing all illegitimate contracts.]\nThe deep-seated curse, which had bound her mind and body for dozens of years, was erased by a deeper darkness.\n[A-Ah...?]\nAt that moment, her wide-open golden eyes returned to normal. Her eyes gleamed with a faint intellect, and widened even further when she looked into Lee Shin woo’s goblin fire.\nTerror and hatred. Anger and fear... Her eyes reflected the amalgamation of all these emotions. If he knew she’d have responded like this, then he’d have turned back into a human. Lee Shin Woo slightly regretted his lack of foresight and quickly said.\n\"The mana inside of this damn cannon’s going to explode, so don’t say anything and follow my instructions. You don’t want to die when you’ve just gotten your sanity back, right?\"\n[Uuaah...]\nWas it because she hadn’t been able to speak for dozens of years? Fortunately, she was able to understand Lee Shin Woo because of the link between them and nodded her head. She then began to control her mana.\nEven if it’s rotten, it’s still a herring. She was able to return her mana to normal and circulate it throughout her body. Once she began to properly circulate the mana throughout her body, her ruined body regained a bit of its strength back. As expected, the effects of mana were truly amazing.\n[Ugh. Keuk... Kuheuk...!]\nBut there was a problem. The amount of mana she could control was far less than the cannon’s capacity. No matter what she did, the cannon’s mana wouldn’t obey her commands.\nIt made sense; she was only the trigger. It didn’t matter when they pulled the trigger; what mattered was that they had already pulled the trigger, activating the cannon. Lee Shin Woo realized that after coming into contact with her. Now he had no choice but to do something about the cannon himself!\n\"Hey, do you have a good way of dealing with this?\"\n[Uuuah.]\nShe was made aware of the situation by Lee Shin Woo but shook her head as tears streamed down her face. Because she had just realized what she’d done for dozens of years, she wasn’t in the right state of mind.\nShe, who had possessed the title of Spirit Princess, had sucked away the spirits’ life force and turned it into destructive power! She couldn’t show her face to the spirits, who had once been her friends. She was in no condition to be stopping the cannon!\n[Ugh. The... spirits...!]\nOf course, her friends had mostly been killed by Lee Shin Woo and company, allowing them to be at peace, but it probably wouldn’t be a good idea to tell her that right now. Lee Shin Woo grabbed onto the Evil Eye chain that connected her and the cannon and said.\n\"You can mourn them later. But if you die here, then you won’t be able to do anything. And you can’t take your revenge on the ones who did this to you either. If you want to take revenge on the ones who did this to the underground spirits, then you have to survive.\"\n[Re...venge...?]\n\"That’s right.\"\nKratia and Jin, who were watching from behind, said ’it’s finally started’ and chattered on, but Lee Shin Woo just ignored them and continued. New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on novel{f}ire.net\n\"The people who forced you underground. And the people who led the Empire to its ruin. The ones who forced you to sacrifice your friends. All the people who used you. They’re still living and breathing, so are you just going to wallow away in self pity and die?\"\n[Ah, but... I’m...]\n\"And there are still some spirits that are alive here.\"\n[Aaaah...!]\nMm. Going at it this way got a better reaction out of her. Lee Shin Woo took this opportunity and pushed forward.\n\"You have to stop this if you want to save them. It’s not just the underground. The spirits on the surface are waiting for you to rescue them.\"\n\"Living spirits... Aah.\"\nHer voice was becoming firmer and her eyes were becoming clearer. Dana Von Etliber was the Empire’s greatest Elementalist. She could tell that Lee Shin Woo not only wielded several elements but was also connected with several spirits as well. For some reason, that fact reinvigorated her.\n\"How can an undead contract... No, I shouldn’t be talking about other people when I’m in this state.\"\n\"Oh. Your echo’s gone now... It seems like you’re back.\"\nAlthough her complexion was still ghastly and she hadn’t been released of her ’delayed undead transformation’ state, she had regained her mind completely. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head in satisfaction and she said the words he had been waiting for.\n\"I want to live...! Please help me!\"\n\"I was waiting for you to say that. I’m glad you’re a lot easier to deal with than that old bag. Alright. Then, let’s save you first. Kratia, I’m going to pull this woman out, so use your Stasis Magic on the cannon one more time!\"\n\"Easy for you to say!\"\n\"?\"\nFirst, Lee Shin Woo pulled off the Evil Eye chains that bound her to the cannon. If she couldn’t control the cannon, then he was better off just releasing her from it!\nThe chains had originally been tied with a complicated spell, but due to his control over darkness he was able to pull them out with ease. Then, he superimposed his previous fragment of Evil Eye with this one, creating a single grain.\n\"Next up.\"\n\"H-How did you...!?\"\nDana Von Etliber couldn’t believe her sudden freedom and looked dumbfounded. But that wasn’t the end. Now that her link with the cannon was broken, the undead curse was quickly descending upon her in order to transform her into an undead!\nShe, who hadn’t been picked by God, would turn into an undead if he didn’t do anything. If her condition was even a little bit better, then he and Jin could’ve continuously sucked the curse out of her and prolonged her life, but she was in terrible shape, so a makeshift method wouldn’t work.\n’So... I have no choice but to try an experimental method!’\nLee Shin Woo immediately extended his hand towards her and used his ’Dark Shadow’. If he were to simultaneously eliminate as much of the curse as possible while also giving her an ability to repel the curse, then she could live! He’d failed with Seira, but he couldn’t afford to fail a second time!\n\"You can’t reject this power. It’ll nullify the mana that’s attempting to turn you into an undead.\"\n\"I understand... But is that really possible?\"\n\"A deeper darkness consumes the weaker one.\"\nEventually, Dark Shadow covered the princess’s body and imbued it with darkness. The princess didn’t resist the energy; in fact, she used her own mana to supplement it.\nBefitting an Elementalist who had controlled countless spirits, she seemed confident in harmonizing her own mana with another person’s. It was quite relieving for Lee Shin Woo.\n’A body which can’t be infiltrated by the curse.’\nHe hadn’t understood this before, but now that he understood it, the idea behind it was quite simple. Couldn’t he just copy the blessing God had given him? Dark Shadow, which possessed the power to reverse all cause-and-effect, had the ability to do so.\nDana’s case was different from Seira’s; Seira’s body had been all but dead, and her mana and physical body had sustained critical damage. She had been putting off her death. However, Dana’s body, which had been in contact with the undead curse for dozens of years, was, at this point, neither dead nor alive. Her body was extremely vulnerable to the undead curse but was also the optimal container for an ability that repelled it.\nOf course, it should be impossible to bestow this karma upon someone without being God herself, but Lee Shin Woo was able to do it!\n’Wild Card...!’\nThis was the third change, following Jin and Seira. Whenever he used it, he felt himself becoming more familiar with it. He could do this regularly now. But there was one issue here: that this was a contract created through the darkness element.\n[Is it really ok?]\n[To be frank... I’d like to hear more before I make a decision. But if I don’t do as you say, then I’ll become an undead just like Seagald, Feotane, or my father. If that’s the case, then I have to live first, no matter what happens in the future. You told Seira before that she had to live first too.]\n[Ah, you were listening?]\n[Moreover, I feel like I’m fated to be with you. You’re the last remaining Elementalist in this dead world. I can feel how happy the spirits are through their memories. I’d like to believe in that. And please introduce those girls to me later.]\nAs expected, he should’ve just said he was an Elementalist like her; that was all it took to convince her. It had gone so much more smoothly than his time with Seira that it moved him to tears. And then, Lee Shin Woo began her transformation in earnest.\nOf course, the change was a lot smaller than with Seira. Because she wasn’t a hero, she hadn’t accumulated much karma. Plus, he had managed to steal a large quantity of mana from the cannon; with the addition of his Dark Shadow, her body and mind were given a small ’advantage’, that’s all.\n’...Reject death. Survive.’\nThe combination of Lee Shin Woo’s authority, which distorted reality, Dana Von Etliber’s miraculous body, which bordered between life and death, and her incredible mana ability...\nAll of those factors mixed together and created a miracle. Something that hadn’t existed in the world was born once more.\n\"Aaaaaah!\"\nA blinding light burst forth. Immediately after, her body was covered in darkness. There was pretty much no change to her outward appearance, but Lee Shin Woo knew that she was a completely different existence than before.\n[You have created the Lv8 Immortal Princess Dana, and have formed a subordinate contract with her.]\n[While this was only possible because the target aided you with her own will and ability, you have succeeded in creating a never before seen species! The Immortal, a high rank species that lives between the border of life and death, and is closer to death than any other, yet has avoided death and lives. This embodies the way you yourself live. As their creator, they will give you unlimited love and esteem.]\n[You have acquired the title, ’Species Creator’ and all stats have increased by 100! You have fulfilled a portion of the requirements in achieving the fusion element between light and darkness! The Rebellion skill has become Lv8 and all stats have increased by 30. When you meet the conditions of the Rebellion skill, all stats increase by 24%.]\nWith his Rebellion skill going up by 2 levels in one go, overall... It felt like God would scold him for this, but like always, Lee Shin Woo didn’t let it bother him and just decided to move on!",

    "content": "<Chapter 47. We Got a New Colleague! - 4>\n[Lv8 Immortal Princess Dana]\n[Immortals are a species that has avoided death. They possess a perfect body that can switch between a spirit’s astral body and a human’s physical body. They are also able to wield the darkness element proficiently.]\n[As they are fated to live one step away from death, most lethal curses and poisons are ineffective against them and they age extremely slowly. Just their very existence distorts the world’s cause-and-effect, and the world is at risk of collapse if too many are gathered. While they have a long lifespan, their reproductive rate is low.]\n[The Beginner Dark Shadow element has become Lv9. Magic has increased by 20.]\n\"Wow, that’s awesome. I want to be an Immortal too.\"\n\"You’re already an undead.\"\nA new species had been born! It was a bewildering achievement, but the wavelength was truly amazing. It wasn’t just an amazing karma for her, but for Lee Shin Woo, the one who’d achieved the feat, as well.\nIt felt like he’d constructed a bridge, allowing them to go somewhere they couldn’t before. It was a mysterious feeling, as though his potential had expanded. In other words, this was the first case where Lee Shin Woo had fooled the world with the Joker’s innate skills.\n\"Immortal...\"\nWhereas, the previous Dana Von Etliber, now the Immortal Princess Dana, looked over her body; she was astonished as she absorbed the relevant information that flowed through her mind.\nShe was neither human nor undead; her mind and body possessed a completely different authority from them. Dana could now switch between her astral body and her physical body as well as avoid death; her new abilities were so amazing that she couldn’t comprehend them.\n\"Ah, you definitely got that from me. I haven’t perfected that ability yet, so why did she...\"\n\"Maybe it’s because of the subject’s condition? You said she was in a unique situation. She was exposed to the undead curse for dozens of years without God’s blessing, yet she survived regardless. Do you really think there’d be another case underground of a human surviving that long?\"\n\"That’s true, but could you not use the word ’subject’...?\"\nJin spoke sullenly and Lee Shin Woo replied with a bitter smile. By now, he’d mostly figured out how she ticked. Whenever he spoke to another girl or he engaged in any sort of skinship with them, Jin’s mood would sour.\n\"Wow... This is quite the mysterious feeling. But I’m sure it’s not due to my long-awaited freedom. I wanted to be free, but how could I pay you back for such a gift...?\"\n\"I’m glad you’re so amazed at your new body and all, but even an Immortal will die if this thing blows. Focus on this now.\"\n\"Ah! T-That’s right!\"\nOf course, saving the princess was quite a big deal, but Lee Shin Woo’s original goal was to calm down the cannon which would soon blow.\nDana was so shocked by her rebirth as an Immortal that she’d completely forgotten the current situation, but she was alerted thanks to Lee Shin Woo’s request. Because an Immortal could freely choose their bodily state, she was currently floating in the air with ease.\n\"Kratia, how is it?\"\n\"Hoo. Hoo... Now... you ask...!?\"\n\"M-My bad...\"\nWhile Lee Shin Woo was busy saving Dana, Kratia had been keeping the cannon at bay. She gritted her teeth and looked over towards them.\nShe had assimilated her Orb and had been converting all of her mana into ice. She’d managed to slow down the mana, but she’d used way too much mana today, so she was approaching her limit.\n\"You asked ’how is it’...? It feels like... it’ll blow any minute now...!\"\n\"I’ll help a bit.\"\nLee Shin Woo had also used a ton of mana today, but he gathered more mana and helped Kratia with her Stasis Magic, looking like it didn’t bother him in the least. Because he could use the high rank ice element, he was able to help her pretty easily, but...\n\"This is just a temporary solution.\"\n\"Unfortunately... it’s impossible to stop the cannon once it’s been activated. Now that it’s come to this, we have no choice but to get rid of the energy.\"\n\"Alright. Then let’s focus on that.\"\nLee Shin Woo retraced his steps.\nFirst, this hundred meter tall cannon had activated its accumulated mana and was about to blow.\nSecond, the mana it’d gathered from the denizens of Bayran, as well as the spirits, had been contaminated and stored within.\nThird, once the mana had been activated, stopping it was impossible. It had to fire somewhere.\n\"What if we stop it and run away?\"\n\"We could.\"\n\"...Huh?\"\nKratia had asked without much thought, and Lee Shin Woo agreed much the same. Then, Kratia looked at him vacantly. Though it was difficult to tell the difference with her, as she normally had a pretty neutral expression.\n\"We can...?\"\n\"Yep. Of course, we can’t get away by just running. Even Jin can’t get away from the blast running at top speed.\"\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo and Jin both possessed resurrection abilities, but the cannon was so powerful that they would probably die more than a few times.\nWhat about the others? They would die without question. Even Dana Von Etliber, who’d just been reborn as an Immortal, would die too. It wasn’t something that even she, as someone who’d barely avoided death, could survive.\n\"But I can transport us somewhere else with the Heaven Door’s Key, a place where the blast won’t reach us.\"\n\"Then can’t we just run away...?\"\n\"But there’s a maximum occupancy. If we took the Heaven Door’s Key, then I’d have to sacrifice all the Pauls and golems.\"\nAnd Lee Shin Woo didn’t want that. Not only did he still have a use for Arema, he didn’t want his loyal Pauls to die here.\nAbove all, he couldn’t allow this much energy to go to waste.\n[Hoo. Hoo... So there’re things that even the Heaven Defying General can’t do, huh?]\n\"Oh, you’re awake.\"\nArema Steelworker had awoken, but he probably wouldn’t be helpful in the current situation. However, he decided upon a course of action that Lee Shin Woo hadn’t expected. Arema Steelworker aimed his fist at him.\nHe’d collected a considerable amount of energy at the end of his fist. Why was he doing this now? Lee Shin Woo tilted his head, as he couldn’t understand why.\n\"What are you doing?\"\n[I heard everything. I’ll die here anyway, and you’re trying to run away... If that’s the case, then I have only one job. To bury you, and even my body, here. I, Arema Steelworker, cannot retreat, even against you!]\n\"...Ah.\"\nNow that he thought about it, one could interpret their conversation that way! Lee Shin Woo’s intention was more along the lines of ’at this rate, we’ll all die, so let’s all find a different way out of this’, but Arema and the golems had interpreted it as ’the golems will all die here anyway’! The situation had become pointlessly complicated!\n\"Arema, it seems like you’re misunderstanding something. If possible, I’m going to save you guys too. To do that, I’m...\"\n[That’s just an excuse. You left your enemies behind you and talked without a second thought. You only have yourself to blame!]\nJeez. It looked like he wouldn’t be able to clear up the misunderstanding! This was no time to be fighting amongst themselves, yet Arema Steelworker had collected a ton of metal mana and launched it towards him regardless.\nHowever, before Lee Shin Woo could waste his time fighting Arema, someone else had stood in front of him. It was none other than Dana.\n\"Arema, know your place! This is no place for you, a golem and a dirty follower of the surface!\"\n[You survived, Princess! But what can an Elementalist do without any spirits!?]\n\"Ha!\"\nShe didn’t have any spirits on hand, but Lee Shin Woo had bestowed upon her a high concentration of darkness element mana. Although it was her first time wielding said element, she extended the darkness forward and absorbed Arema’s attack. At the same time, she launched dozens of darkness chains towards him and immobilized him!\n[Kuhahk!?]\n\"You were always weak to elemental mana. That must be why you always hated Elementalists like myself. I wonder just how humiliating it must have been for you!\"\n[Keuk. This darkness... You didn’t... Heaven Defying General, you bastard! What did you do to this woman!?]\n\"To think you’d be looking elsewhere during our fight. It seems you’ve grown!\"\n[Help our lord!]\n[My lord!]\nArema’s golems rushed into the fray. Lee Shin Woo was busy enough dealing with the cannon as is!\nLee Shin Woo gritted his teeth and launched his remaining weapons, killing the weakest golems with ease. He’d only let them live, as he felt like he’d find a use for them later, but it was quite laughable to see them rushing forward.\n[Chi Paul.]\nAt the same time, he didn’t forget to send a message to his subordinate.\n[I’m listening, Lord Paul Zero!]\n[What’s the situation over there?]\n[They had three level 7 elites, but we’ve just finished dealing with their entire force. We’re in the middle of collecting all the loot!]\n[Alright, good.]\nAs he thought, Anti-Skull was dangerous. There were six level 7 elites that had entered into the inner city! If Lee Shin Woo hadn’t brought enough troops, then he would’ve been the one that’d lost!\nNo, the loot wasn’t important right now. Their most important battle lay in front of them.\n[I keep telling you to come and go. Sorry about that, Chi Paul. But I have good news for you this time.]\n[Are you saying that...?]\n[That’s right. You guys will have to take care of the golems personally. I can do it myself, but I’m busy dealing with something a bit more important right now.]\n[It’s an honor! Thank you so much! We’ll be there ASAP!]\nThose weren’t empty words. Since he could feel the Chi Pauls rushing over to the inner city! Moreover, they were coming over extremely quickly, as the chaos in the city had destroyed all the traps!\n[Damn you, Heaven Defying General... Let me go!]\n\"Relax. Since I’m not the one who’ll kill you.\"\n[Keuk. Keuuuk!]\nWhile Arema was struggling against Dana, Lee Shin Woo used his energy to pressure the golems, killing the level 6 golems, as they weren’t worth the Chi Pauls’ time, and preventing the rest from moving. The remaining level 7 Four Heavenly Commanders were unable to resist, and merely staggered and screamed. It was truly an overwhelming pressure.\nBut even Lee Shin Woo was restless. To think he’d have to play around with these idiots when the cannon could blow at any minute...! If he hadn’t managed to evolve Dana as smoothly as he did, then he’d be the one in trouble!\n[Lord Paul Zero!]\n\"How the hell did you guys get here so fast!?\"\nAt that moment, the Chi Pauls had returned to the battle with impeccable timing. They were so happy to be facing off against the golems that their eyes gleamed. They were right about to rush into the battle, but Lee Shin Woo stopped them.\n\"Before you go, I have a present for you.\"\n[A present... Does that mean...?]\nChi Paul asked, representing the rest of them. Lee Shin Woo smiled benevolently and took out an item he’d taken out once before. Seeing that, Chi Paul, as well as Arema, who was fighting against Dana, widened their eyes.\n[Y-You bastard...! That’s...! That’s...!]\n\"This is Arema’s real body. ...You’ll be able to do your best after eating this, right?\"\n[Lord Paul Zero...! Thank you so much...!]\n[You bastard, Paul Zeroooooooooo!] The most update n0vels are published on NoveI~Fire.net\nAs if he were a mother giving her son a lunchbox filled with a nutritious and light meal before their college exam, Lee Shin Woo passed Chi Paul Arema’s real body. Chi Paul was deeply touched and his throat was choked up, yet he barely managed to respond. Whereas, Arema Steelworker was filled with rage and hatred.\n\"You demon...\"\n\"Affirmative.\"\nJin said quietly. Although Kratia was busy maintaining the Statis Magic, she faintly nodded her head and agreed with her.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 47 part5",
    "content": "<Chapter 47. We Got a New Colleague! - 5>\n[Huaah. Uoooooh!]\nWhen Chi Paul absorbed Arema Steelworker’s body, the change was incredibly dramatic. He screamed, as though he were a Saiyan witnessing his friend’s death and turning Super Saiyan, and resulted in a dramatically changed Chi Paul!\n[Kuguoooooh!]\n[Kihi. Kihiiiiit! Power. This power...! Is for taking my revenge!]\n[Aah. It’s delicious. So delicious! The bodies of those traitors. They taste sweet. So sweet!]\nBeside him, the other Chi Pauls had absorbed the remaining Four Heavenly Commanders’ original bodies, or the other golems’ knight bodies. Each and every one of the Chi Pauls were transforming into a frightening and strange new appearance.\nThey’d hidden the fact that they were Chimeras so well until now, but they suddenly had transformed into such a fearsome state, as if they were cats gnawing at and spitting out a grasshopper.\n[It’s... It’s not over yet. We need more to complete our evolution...!]\n\"Right. What you need is over there.\"\nTheir master, Lee Shin Woo, knew exactly what they needed to complete their evolution! They required Arema Steelworker, who had forgotten all about his battle with Dana and rushed over, along with the rest of the Four Heavenly Commanders, and the golems.\n[How dare you... How dare you give my body to those lowly beasts!]\n[I can’t forgive you. I can’t permit this...! I’ll rip you to pieces!]\nYeah. Just eating their bodies wouldn’t complete their revenge. Only by eating their golem bodies, which held their very souls, could they take one step further as Avengers!\n[Lord Paul Zero! At this very moment, we are so glad that we pledged our loyalty to you...! We will prove our loyalty to you now!]\n[Kuoooooooh!]\n[Revenge! It’s time for our long-awaited revenge!]\n[Unleash your rage onto the arrogant and narrow-minded surface dwellers!]\n[We’ll crush you, exactly like what you did to us!]\nAll the Chimeras had overcome their limits and were emitting their increased mana; they then faced the golems and rushed towards them. Although Chi Paul should’ve been a level 7 still, the pressure he emitted was no less than a level 8’s. No, the main Chi Paul wasn’t the only one; the other Chi Pauls were the same!\nLee Shin Woo soon realized that his Chi Pauls were under the effect of his Rebellion skill. It was quite advantageous to him.\n\"Help them, Dana. With their help, you should be able to take down those golems with ease, as they’re tired from battle after battle.\"\n\"It’s quite persuasive hearing it from the very man that exhausted the golems to that extent.\"\n\"They’re the knights that were sacrificed in the surface dwellers’ plan...! Of course I’ll help. The surface dwellers must pay for their sins!\"\nFortunately, Dana wasn’t swayed by their hideous appearance and had immediately figured out the truth. The more he talked with her, the less he could stand Seira Von Retandane...!\nLee Shin Woo was moved and wiped the resulting tears. He then left the battle to her and turned around. He wanted to watch the Chimeras take their revenge, but as he’d said several times, he didn’t have the time to do so!\n\"Shin Woo. This is really killing me...!\"\n\"Don’t worry. Arema’s attack caused my head to spin, giving me an idea.\"\n\"Are you planning on changes its vector?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nIt seemed like Kratia had the same idea. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and placed his hand onto the cannon once more.\nIt felt as though the massive accumulated energy would blow at any time, and the ice element mana holding it would melt away. As he thought, stopping it now would be impossible.\n\"But changing its direction might be possible. Since it’s a cannon.\"\n\"I was thinking about that too.\"\nKratia hadn’t only been focusing on keeping the massive energy in check. She had been trying to push the energy into a different direction, in order to reduce the damage it inflicted.\nHowever, doing so wasn’t so simple. It was difficult enough that Dana, who had been controlling the cannon before, had failed, so how hard must it have been for her!? But Lee Shin Woo hadn’t suggested it without having anything in mind.\n\"Ta-da! So here’s where this guy comes in.\"\nIt was the bone bracelet that he’d equipped to his wrist. It was the artifact that the Archmage had left behind, the Proof of Death.\nIt would also serve as proof that Lee Shin Woo could beat the Archmage, as it had absorbed a portion of the Archmage’s soul, but aside from that, the artifact itself was quite impressive...\n[Proof of Death (+4)]\n[Lv8]\n[Durability: 1,327/2,500]\n[Element: Darkness Lv8]\n[Options: Magic +500; The creator can assume absolute control over similar artifacts and the effectiveness of every artifact in their control is increased.]\n[Special active skill: Rush of Death - This artifact messes with the energy of any artifact that it resonates with. It will cause a huge explosion that deals three times the corresponding artifact’s maximum mana.]\n\"This is completely...\"\n\"Yep. It’s what allowed him to control Dana. I’m telling you, that Lich is really thorough!\"\n\"If you had... something like this... then use it earlier!\"\nKratia was pissed and kept hitting Lee Shin Woo’s chest. She wasn’t being charming; she was really trying to hurt him, but her anger made sense, considering how much she’d been doing up to now.\nBut Lee Shin Woo felt like it was unfair. Right after he beat the Lich, Seira’s heart had been pierced by her older brother. He’d managed to save her life by turning her into a Banshee, but then he had to fight against Seagald. And now, the cannon was about to blow. He’d revived the princess to help deal with it, but then Arema had decided to attack him one last time! Lee Shin Woo didn’t even have any time to look over his loot!\n’At first, I thought this bracelet just supplemented one’s mana or life force, since the Lich was able to last so long against me.’\nBut the Archmage had just been efficiently draining energy from the cannon with the bracelet. By equipping this bracelet, the Archmage could exhibit unrivaled power with artifacts that he’d created.\n\"Here’s where it gets important.\"\n\"Yeah, this is where it starts.\"\nLee Shin Woo and Kratia agreed to a temporary ceasefire. Once they exchanged eye contact, Kratia ceased her Stasis Magic. Lee Shin Woo immediately imbued a generous amount of his darkness mana into the Proof of Death, and turned the cannon around.\n’The bracelet’s special active skill is most likely to blame for the energy going out of control. I may not be able to cancel a skill that’s been activated already, but I should be able to adjust the result of that skill...!’\nAlthough he couldn’t stop the cannon from firing, he could turn the cannon in the direction he wanted!\nWas it because he’d reached peak mastery in the darkness element? If not, was it because of his innate ability to distort cause-and-effect as a Joker? He’d done it so easily that his struggles thus far felt funny. The cannon screeched as he adjusted the height of the cannon, as well as its direction!\n\"Alright. If I turn it this way, it’ll face the capital, right?\"\n\"But Shin Woo, there’s a fundamental problem with that.\"\n\"You’re talking about the undead curse, right?\"\n\"They may not become as strong as the forces in the palace, but they’ll become at least 1.5x as strong.\"\nNo matter where he shot this, the energy would result in a catastrophe. If he shot it straight, then he might be able to pierce right through the barrier and deliver the undead curse to the surface. It had that much power.\n\"It’s so powerful that it may create a dungeon. You can’t just shoot it as is... Though it’s much better than us dying.\"\n\"...This is where it all starts. Kratia, watch. You may be able to wield this power in the near future.\"\n\"That’s that unknown power that you used to change the Spirit General...\"\nThat’s right. Lee Shin Woo began to use his innate element, Dark Shadow.\nIt might be impossible. He might fail, like how he failed to save Seira’s life as a human.\nBut he might succeed too. On his second try he managed to turn Dana into a new species didn’t he? So, he would never know without trying.\n’Moreover, I have this bracelet... the artifact’s controller.’\nWhat would the Lich think when he realized that he’d lost the Proof of Death? He may think that another person wouldn’t be able to use the artifact that he’d created as they pleased. Since he had so much pride, as he had created the item and was able to wield it so well.\n’However...’\nLee Shin Woo was the master of darkness. If the artifact was created by the darkness element, then Lee Shin Woo would be able to wield it better than any other. At least, he should. Even if that weren’t true, he would make it so. He would fool them.\nThe world, mana, the artifact itself, and the cannon. He’d fool them all.\n[The Beginner Dark Shadow element has become Lv10 and evolved into the intermediate level! You can cause more fundamental reversals of cause-and-effect! Magic has increased by 100!]\nWas it a coincidence? At that moment, the Dark Shadow element evolved into the intermediate level. It’d only reached level 9 just a short while ago, when he’d turned Dana into an Immortal!\nIf it had reached the intermediate level earlier, then he might’ve been able to save Seira. However, it was precisely because she’d turned into a Banshee that the Dark Shadow element had leveled up this much. In any case, the new Dark Shadow gave him a ton of confidence. At the same time, he realized how to more efficiently use the Dark Shadow element.\n’I’m going to start by making small changes in cause-and-effect. Until it causes a huge domino effect and everything breaks down.’\nAlthough this bracelet was originally the Archmage’s, it had become Lee Shin Woo’s item now. That would be the start. He would channel his Dark Shadow through the artifact and control this ridiculously huge cannon... No, he would take ownership of it!\n\"It didn’t work before, but now I should be able to...!\"\nLee Shin Woo placed his bracelet-equipped hand onto the gun barrel and concentrated. He would fool the world, the cannon, and reverse cause-and-effect!\nDarkness formed, as if were being squeezed out of his fingertips.

    "content": "<Chapter 47. We Got a New Colleague! - 6>\nEveryone shut their eyes tightly at the blinding light. The undead curse, which had built and built over dozens of years, had been converted into the highest level of light by Dark Shadow; a light so powerful that it couldn’t be classified as either intermediate or high rank.\n[Keuk!]\n[Gyaahk!]\nIt didn’t matter how much you trained your body if you were to face it. Only Lee Shin Woo, who had reached peak darkness mastery, could deal with it somewhat. Fortunately, it didn’t target his party.\nWith the help of the Proof of Death, he’d changed the cannon’s trajectory; it possessed enough light to topple a country, and that very light went towards the capital in a gentle curve.\nHe’d converted all of the accumulated energy into light, and he would return it to its creator... It was a plausible ending.\n[The Heaven Defying Flag Bearer (+5) has been destroyed. Your Bone Reinforcement is not at a high enough level yet to absorb it. Repairing it is possible.]\n\"Of course it’d be destroyed.\"\nWhile he vacantly watched the arc of light, he heard the sound of the hundred meter tall bone cannon begin to break apart and simultaneously received that message.\nLee Shin Woo had expected this to happen and merely smiled bitterly. He hadn’t let out a tester or anything; he’d discharged all of cannon’s accumulated energy at once. It would be stranger if it hadn’t broken after releasing all that energy.\nOnce the cannon was finished releasing all its energy, it broke into pieces and fell to the ground. Lee Shin Woo picked up the pieces of the Heaven Defying Flag Bearer and placed them into his inventory. When he’d reached level 8, his inventory had expanded, so he was able to store all of the pieces.\n\"Shin Woo, you always go above and beyond my imagination when solving problems. It’s thrilling. Though I don’t miss it.\"\n\"You don’t need to miss it.\"\nKratia, who had just watched from start to finish, came over to him with a vacant expression and said.\nLee Shin Woo pushed her aside, as she looked kind of out of it. While doing so, Kratia spoke unexpectedly.\n\"I think I gleaned something from that. There’s something beyond what I was seeking.\"\n\"Oh, really?\"\n\"It was an element. If an element is brought to its maximum potential, it then evolves into more of a concept than an amalgamation of mana, right?\"\n\"R-Right... You really pieced that together from just watching that beam?\"\n\"Thanks, Shin Woo. You gave me some hints and a clear view of it right in front of me.\"\nAs expected, geniuses were different. Lee Shin Woo had barely come to that realization after acquiring an innate element, yet Kratia, who was a human without Bone Reinforcement, was able to figure something out from watching his Dark Shadow first hand. He was astonished by her findings.\n\"...Given time and a budget, I should be able to do it too.\"\n\"There’s plenty of time in the future.\"\n\"I’m not talking about the time I have left.\"\nBecause the shot was so powerful, the light remained in the air, as if it were a mirage. Kratia pointed to the mirage, no, the capital it was aimed at and said.\n\"Your battle’s already begun. We don’t have much time left here.\"\n\"Ah, so that’s what you were talking about.\"\nHe couldn’t help but nod. If the Emperor just sat back and did nothing after getting attacked by that barrage of light, then he wouldn’t be an Emperor; he’d be an idiot.\nThe final battle was approaching. Even though Kratia was a genius, she wouldn’t be able to obtain an innate element in that short period of time. There was an absolute limit to one’s level.\n\"If only you could use Bone Reinforcement on me too...\"\n\"I’ll use it on you later if I can. For now, let’s clean up and talk about how we’re going to take down that pissed off Emperor... Huh?\"\nIn any case, they’d taken care of the foremost problem, so Lee Shin Woo had planned on taking care of Arema Steelworker himself. But he was shocked when he turned around. Even Wild Card couldn’t predict this situation.\n[K-Keoheok...!]\n[K-Kuhaaaah...!]\nChi Paul’s sharp nails were penetrating through Arema’s face and stomach. Lee Shin Woo could tell that its nails were piercing through Arema’s core.\nHe wasn’t the only one. The other Chi Pauls were inflicting severe wounds to the other golems as well. Dana was helping them, sure, but how did they manage this in such a short period of time? Lee Shin Woo briefly felt it to be strange, but he understood when he saw the Chi Pauls crying bloody tears.\n[Kahaaahk!]\n[My eyes... My eyes hurt.]\n[It’ll get better. Lord Paul Zero is watching us. So, concentrate on your revenge!]\nThe light that had just recently flooded the city. Dana, as well as Arema Steelworker and his golems were unable to endure the light. However, the Chi Pauls were able to endure purely through their desire for revenge and used this opportunity to strike.\n’An ability, which borders on an authority, that allows them to ignore everything else in the pursuit of their revenge... It’s like the Joker karma. There was meaning behind their class after all.’\nLee Shin Woo felt like he’d understood just how frightening the ’Avenger’ class was.\nHe remembered how badly they wanted to take revenge on Arema and thought, ’perhaps this was the most desirable outcome’ while also thinking of fatalism, something that didn’t suit him at all.\n[It’s... It’s not over yet.]\n[We can’t let you go so easily.]\nThis would be the start of their true revenge. The Chi Pauls used their flames to melt the golems bit by bit, cut them apart, and eat them. They ate the clumps of iron with such voracity that they would soon finish their entire bodies.\n[W-What are you... What are you doing!? Stop... Stop...!]\n[Keuk. Kuhaah...!]\nArema Steelworker cried out. Although his core had been pierced, he endured, perhaps because his core contained his human soul. But in the face of these level 8 enemies, there was nothing he could do; he merely screamed and was forced to just spectate as his golem body was devoured. Official source ıs novèlfire.net\n\"They won’t get heavy metal poisoning?\"\n\"That’s really not a problem at this point, you think?\"\nLee Shin Woo tilted his head and muttered. Jin then sighed and retorted. Kratia tried her best to look away, while Dana said ’M-My eyes!’, unexpectedly letting out a cute voice while turning round and round in the air.\n\"...Heot!\"\nAnd Prince awoke at the best time. Did she even know how many times she’d avoided death while she lay unconscious? She looked around, and soon pointed at Lee Shin Woo and yelled.\n\"My junior! Give me back my junior!\"\n\"You really are a pain... Mm, you think it’s time?\"\n\"It’ll probably be ok. ...Probably.\"\n\"What the hell are you talking about!?\"\nPrince gritted her teeth and yelled, seeing how familiarly the Heaven Defying General and Kratia were conversing. Lee Shin Woo took off his helmet and instantaneously changed his undead face into his human one. Prince shut her mouth.\n\"...Huh?\"\n\"Well, this is how it is, Senior. I’ll explain it soon, so please be patient.\"\n\"Huh? ...Huh?\"\nPrince couldn’t understand what was going on and tilted her head. Kratia thought she might struggle like Seira did, so she grabbed onto her.\nFortunately, she didn’t struggle. She was shocked, unable to accept what was going on, and after trying to process everything... she lost consciousness and fell to the floor once more.\n\"Kratia, did you hit her too hard?\"\n\"I admit, I was trying to hurt her. ...But I think she fainted for a different reason this time.\"\n\"You admit it!?\"\n\"With her personality, it makes sense... Ugh, she’s definitely the type you don’t want as your friend.\"\n\"Jin, how dare you talk behind her back while she’s unconscious...\"\n\"Since she knows you’re undead now, introduce me properly when she wakes up.\"\nThe heroes conversed warmly, washing away a tiny bit of their exhaustion. Then, Chi Paul screamed in joy at fulfilling its revenge.\n[Kuooooooooh!]\n\"...I guess I got to go.\"\n\"Are you going to do to them what you did to me?\"\n\"It won’t be as extreme as what I did to you. Then, I’ll get going.\"\nThe blinding light had subsided somewhat, so Dana approached him and asked. Lee Shin Woo just grinned and replied, and then went towards the Chi Pauls, who had completely devoured all of the golems without leaving a single speck of them.\nThey looked quite menacing, such that they couldn’t show themselves to outsiders, but once they saw Lee Shin Woo, they politely prostrated themselves and didn’t forget to show their respect.\n[Thank you... Thank you so much!]\n[I will devote my entire being to you Lord Paul Zero, for giving me a new life and an opportunity to fulfill my revenge!]\n[If you still have a use for us hideous, leftover monsters, then please use us whenever you see fit!]\n\"How could you call yourselves monsters? You guys are family to me.\"\nLee Shin Woo acted and Jin retched from behind him, but like always, he ignored her.\nHe raised both his hands and covered the Chi Pauls with his darkness, which contained the power of Wild Card. He wasn’t creating an Immortal or anything; he was just trying to make them grow into a different, more favorable direction.\n\"Your revenge has been fulfilled. You’ve already indulged in it, so now digest it and make it your own. Then, not me, but all of you need to decide where you go next.\"\n[Our revenge isn’t finished yet. We cannot rest until the Undead Emperor, as well as the Magic Emperor, who sent Arema down here, are killed. Please command us until then!]\n\"Alright. Then, follow me.\"\n[Yes, sir!]\nThe darkness completely covered the Chimeras, and their bodies, which had become monstrous, melted away within the darkness. Lee Shin Woo spoke as if it were incredibly easy, but it actually wasn’t so.\nIn the process of obtaining their revenge, the Chimeras’ forms had become twisted, and Lee Shin Woo was trying to change their appearance to match their karma; he was doing something ridiculous again!\n\"This’ll hurt. Bear with it.\"\n[This doesn’t even tickle...!]\nThey had eaten both human and metallic bodies, and were unable to properly digest them, so Lee Shin Woo just extracted their souls. He then infused his mana into their bodies, which were a complete mess from mixing everything together, and transformed them into their most natural shape. After that, he returned their souls to their bodies and then tweaked them to suit them.\nBecause he’d acquired so much knowledge pertaining to golems, and had managed to create a few species, it wasn’t very difficult for him. If God were to hear about this, she’d be shocked!\n\"...Alright, I’m finished. That was simple.\"\n\"Hoooo...\"\nUltimately, their bodies looked no different from a human’s. But they were golems on the inside, so they were definitely not human.\nPerhaps he’d succeeded in creating the perfect ’Android’ that everyone dreamed of. Though there was one part of them that wasn’t robotic: their soul!\n[Lv8 Android Zero Avenger Chi Paul]\n[You have combined the info of countless golems and managed to create an android, a being which cannot be distinguished from a regular human. All stats have increased by 20.]\nIn the end, it turned out exactly as he’d expected. While the other Chimera Avenger remained at level 7 (or leveled up from level 6), Chi Paul, who’d devoured Arema Steelworker, had reached level 8!\n\"A-Ah.\"\nChi Paul, which had originally been made up of several souls and bodies, had finally become a singular being.\nIts consciousness, which felt as though it were obscured by a thick mist, had cleared up completely without a single cloud in sight. It felt as though it had woken up from a dream and had returned to reality. Chi Paul just vacantly stared at its creator. The naked handsome man was instantly garbed in armor that resembled Lee Shin Woo’s.\nBut contrary to Lee Shin Woo’s armor, Chi Paul’s armor was a dazzling mix of red and gold. Perhaps it was a symbol of its strength.\n\"Father.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Father!\"\n\"Huh!?\"\nChi Paul called him father and kneeled before him, and the other Chi Pauls followed suit. Lee Shin Woo had suddenly become the father of all these grown men, so he was startled and took a step back. However, the Chi Pauls were relentless.\n\"Thank you, Father!\"\n\"Father!\"\n\"I’m your son, Father!\"\n\"Uh...\"\nHow the hell did it turn out like this? These disgusting guys looked at him with such bright eyes, so Lee Shin Woo wondered whether he should forbid them from calling him ’father’ for the time being or not. But he ultimately decided against it. He was weak to his allies!\n\"Yeah. I’m your father.\"\nOn that day, he’d gained so much, and lost something trivial.\nThe undead curse, as well as the fate of the Underground Empire, had taken one step forward towards their mutual end.",

Agility and Magic have increased by 40.]\n[You have received God’s grace. The Invisible Heart skill’s maximum level has increased by 10.]\nLee Shin Woo received his rewards from the battle only after all the Chi Pauls had finished transforming into androids.\nSince they ate the golems whole, he didn’t receive any Perium, any metal (it probably transformed into bone), or any golem cores. However, he still managed to receive the reward for defeating one of the 12 Generals, albeit belatedly.\n\"My apologies, Father. I wasn’t even thinking...\"\n\"No, it was because of your Avenger karma. It’s fine. I’d rather you level up than get one or two level 8 bones. You have nothing to feel sorry about, Chi Paul.\"\n\"Father...!\"\n\"I’d appreciate it if you weren’t so touched by everything I say...\"\nLee Shin Woo felt a little guilty, since they retained their title of ’Chi Paul’, despite no longer being Chimeras, and checked how they felt. When he asked them about it, they responded with ’We like this name, since it’s the name you gave us, Father!’, which only made him feel even guiltier.\n[You manipulated a battlefield containing the 12 Generals as you pleased and attained victory. Although you lost two of them, you killed two of the 12 Generals and brought one of them over to your side. You sowed chaos, proving your standing as a Joker!]\n[You have acquired the title, ’Compass Breaker’ and all stats have increased by 30! Strength has increased by an additional 50!]\n\"Why do I feel like these titles keep getting more and more chuuni? Although I like how much they raise my stats.\"\n\"...I got the title, ’Witch who Challenges Time’, and my Magic and Agility increased by 30. It’s strange. The ’level’ of your titles are very different, Shin Woo.\"\nThere was one thing that was fortunate for him. When he’d killed the Golden Shadow General, Vellun Von Dorthe, only Jin and he had gained the hero rewards, but killing Arema Steelworker had yielded rewards for Kratia as well!\nHowever, there were still some rewards left that only Lee Shin Woo could obtain... He was referring to the princess that was blinking her eyes beside him. Did her eyes still hurt a little bit? Lee Shin Woo took out a handkerchief for her to wipe her tears, but then a message appeared.\n[You have made one of the 12 Generals, the Lv8 Spirit General, Dana Von Etliber into your loyal subordinate, and have released her from the clutches of the undead curse. This is a greater achievement than simply killing one of the 12 Generals. This act will cause your enemies to quake in fear while also raising the morale of your allies. All stats have increased by 100. You have acquired 20 permits to God’s secret shop. Proficiency in all combat-related skills increases significantly!]\n[You have received God’s grace. The Invisible Heart skill’s maximum level has increased by 15.]\n[Proficiency in the High Rank Command skill has increased. You now understand the potential that lies beyond the Command skill.]\n\"Ooh. I thought the ’Species Creator’ title meant I’d miss out on everything else, but guess not.\"\n\"Isn’t it because that was your reward for creating a new species, rather than killing one of the 12 Generals?\"\n\"Ha. God’s being generous.\"\nFollowing the battle, Lee Shin Woo’s stats increased significantly, which resulted in his body undergoing a change; he closed his eyes gently and smiled (he’d already returned to his human form).\nBut if God were actually here then she’d feel awkward, as there wasn’t much more that she could really do for him. Though his means were truly wicked, he’d managed to kill two level 8 members of the 12 Generals (one of them being a spy from the surface with his own secret plan) and made another his subordinate.\nHe’d done what none of the heroes had been able to do before all in one spot. Even he didn’t know how to feel about it, but in terms of results, he was a real hero.\n\"Ah, shall we eat the bones we couldn’t eat before? ...Jin, you want them?\"\n\"I’m good! I’m fine now!\"\nMost of the bones weren’t anything special, besides the Golden Shadow’s leg bone. His bone was worth absorbing. With his High Rank Combat Sense skill leveling up, Lee Shin Woo’s stats increased by a little more than 120.\nFurthermore, by absorbing his darkness knife, Lee Shin Woo was finally able to able to summon weapons imbued with the darkness element! Moreover, they were more perfect than before!\n\"...It seems like you’ve gotten even further away from me, Shin Woo.\"\n\"He’s always like this. It seems like whenever you blink, this happens.\"\n\"So he was always such an exceptional individual. I understand.\"\nIt was unbelievable; it hadn’t been long since he’d leveled up, yet he was close to 20,000 total stats at 19,945. He’d given up on getting to level 9, as he’d felt it would be impossible, but at some point, the road to getting there had shortened significantly.\nHe’d grown so much quicker than before, so he tilted his head in confusion. But in a way, it was only natural. When he’d become level 8, he’d been doing the ’unexplainable’ on a regular basis, causing his karma to skyrocket.\n\"I still need to increase my stats by about 6,000... It’ll probably be difficult to get to level 9 before fighting the Emperor. Beating him should be a piece of cake if I reach level 9.\"\n\"That’s what you call greed.\"\n\"I hope the Emperor doesn’t come over here right away.\"\nAfter all, they’d just shot and created a huge blast at the capital. Kratia felt like they should run away ASAP, but Lee Shin Woo firmly shook his head.\n\"You really think the Emperor could get out unscathed from that big of a blast? He can’t respond right away. Moreover, there’s the matter of his troops. At least 20% of his troops should’ve been vaporized by that blast.\"\n\"Probably not, Hero.\"\nSurprisingly, Dana was the one who retorted. She folded the handkerchief, placed it within her chest, and spoke calmly. He had no idea why she was calling him ’Hero’.\n\"The capital’s thorn wall is on a completely different level than the one here. It’s because the source of darkness mana is in the capital. Moreover, my father... the Emperor may have done something to it after becoming an undead. So your beam shouldn’t have cut down their troops.\"\n\"It’s that powerful...?\"\n\"Regardless of how powerful the defense, troops level 5 or less would’ve been destroyed. However, low-leveled enemies are meaningless against us.\"\nIn other words, assuming she were right, there were only elite level 6 troops or higher left in the capital. He was wondering why he hadn’t gotten a message notifying him of some extraordinary feat, but if the capital’s defenses were that thorough then it made sense.\n\"Then we have to just be satisfied with them not getting any stronger.\"\n\"Hoo, hoo... You weren’t listening, Hero.\"\nBut then, for some reason, Dana smiled meaningfully. At that moment... a message appeared in front of Lee Shin Woo.\n[You have completely destroyed the capital’s thorn wall, as well as the rest of its physical and magical defenses! You are the first to achieve such an incredible feat! Now your enemies will have to face the heroes in the open. The final battle is approaching!]\n[You have acquired the title, ’Shield Breaker’! You have acquired the special passive skill, ’Soul Strike’ MAX. All your physical and magical attacks gain 10% true damage. Your attacks ignore your opponent’s defenses, resistances, properties and inflict true damage onto them! You have fulfilled a portion of the conditions necessary to achieve the light and darkness fusion element!]\n\"Huh!?\"\n\"It seems like you’ve achieved a feat. It makes sense. You unleashed such light. The thorn wall must have collapsed.\"\n\"It wasn’t just the thorn wall. I destroyed all of the capital’s physical and magical defenses too. So this is what you were talking about...\"\n\"Yes.\"\nLee Shin Woo felt like he’d been struck by lightning. In other words, rather than reducing the capital’s troops, Dana was...\n\"So you’re saying it’s more important that the blast eliminated all the capital’s defenses.\"\n\"That’s correct. My father was always more talented in defense, rather than offense. The capital’s thorn wall was considered an ’absolute defense’, and although he’s been trapped in the capital for so many years, my father has drawn more power from the source to perfect the defense. Yet you destroyed it so... Hoo, hoo. It was quite a delightful blast.\"\nThe thorn wall, an obstacle that lay beyond the 12 Generals, had been destroyed, so now the heroes could invade the capital freely. When he thought about it, it was truly ironic. He’d used the very weapon the Emperor had prepared to get to the surface to destroy his defenses!\nAnd because of that, he’d gained the ’Soul Strike’ skill in preparation for the final battle, so Lee Shin Woo didn’t have any complaints. Moreover, this skill ’smelled’ like an authority, just like his innate elements. The fact that he’d fulfilled a portion of the conditions necessary to acquire the light and darkness fusion element was proof of that. It meant that there was more to pursue.\n’I can’t really deny it anymore. Jeez. While the talented heroes were fighting against the Demon King, I was just trying to find a way to be human again, so how did it turn out like this?’\nIt didn’t matter; it didn’t change anything. There was no reason to hide the fact that he’d fired the cannon anymore. He’d provoked the Emperor for sure, and he’d have to give it everything he had to keep himself alive. The Lich who’d lost his body once before was still out there too.\n’...Wait a sec.’\nHe thought back to the recent battle and recalled something.\n\"What was Seagald Von Retadane even trying to do here?\"\n\"Wasn’t he trying to recruit his little sister? He perfected the Anti-Skull process by watching the Pauls and led her here to...\"\n\"No, that’s not it. He didn’t come here for just Seira. He came here for this cannon too... What’s the original name again? Heaven Rending Cannon? He was trying to do something with this too.\"\n\"Maybe he was trying to shoot it at the capital to strengthen the Emperor.\"\n\"No way.\"\nIf that were his intention, then he wouldn’t have gone about it like this. He would’ve sworn his allegiance to the Emperor and...\n\"Ah.\"\nHe realized all of a sudden. When he thought back to how he used the Heaven Rending Cannon, then the answer became simple. He knew what Seagald had intended to use the cannon for. It was similar to what he’d used it for! Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs nοvelfire.net\n\"The Anti-Skull test... The Anti-Skull test’s objective is...?\"\n\"Resisting the undead transformation... No, that’s not it. It’s to make sane undead.\"\n\"What happens if they’re sane?\"\n\"They’ll try to invade the surface... Ah.\"\nJin realized it too now.\n\"Shin Woo, is Seagald...?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nLee Shin Woo clicked his tongue and nodded his head.\n\"That bastard. By mixing his mana into the Heaven Rending Cannon and firing it at the capital, he was trying to convert all of the imperial forces into Anti-Skull... He would lead the Emperor and invade the surface!\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 48. - Premature Family Plan - 2>\nRather than hate the Emperor, who’d turned his people into the undead, he was trying to change his mind and correct his mistake.\nThat was Seagald’s goal. He was never against the Emperor in the first place. On the contrary, if the undead curse had never occurred, then he would still be the one closest to the Emperor.\n\"Now I get it. If we assume that that was his goal, then everything makes sense... I wonder how I never even considered it.\"\n\"Opposing the Heaven Defying General, and backstabbing the Metal God General, a spy sent from the surface were both...\"\n\"Then why start acting now? Because the Anti-Skull test wasn’t perfect?\"\nLee Shin Woo briefly thought about it and soon firmly shook his head.\n\"There’s that, but they also couldn’t approach and convert the Emperor’s forces into Anti-Skull given their strength. The entire reason we were able to cause such chaos here was because we’d killed so many of the 12 Generals.\"\n\"That’s really persuasive; coming from the guy who’s killed most of them.\"\n\"The timing... The timing was paramount...\"\nHe’d finally figured out Seagald’s plan, but it didn’t change anything, at least for the time being. Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on novel⦿fire.net\nAt any rate, Seagald had failed miserably, and the once Heaven Rending Cannon, now Heaven Defying Flag Bearer, had expended all of its energy and shattered with Lee Shin Woo placing it into his inventory after.\n\"But there’s a chance he might try something similar in the future.\"\n\"We have to take this seriously. To think we’d have to worry about both the Imperial Army and Anti-Skull... You really should’ve killed Seagald back there.\"\n\"I’m so sorry that I wasn’t skilled enough.\"\nHe’d never even thought about this before, but if Seagald’s technique worked on the Emperor or the Archmage, then it posed a serious problem. A simple issue he could originally deal with purely underground would suddenly involve the surface and turn into a major catastrophe.\nThe biggest problem was that the undead curse, which had been suppressed thus far, was spreading to the surface! He had to stop that no matter what. The biggest threat to the surface wasn’t the Undead Emperor; it was Seagald Von Retadane!\nRetadane might’ve known about this before; maybe that’s why she hated her older brother so much.\n\"Shin Woo, are your undead safe from Anti-Skull?\"\n\"Nothing to worry about there. The ’Anti-Skull transformation’ is a little inferior to my own process.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s ’contract’ was a result of his innate skills as a Joker, as well as his peak darkness mastery. No matter how hard Seagald tried to turn them, they were already contracted to Lee Shin Woo, so he wouldn’t be able to steal them from him.\n\"No, that’s not the issue here! Listen to me!\"\n\"The current situation’s more important than you are, Senior.\"\n\"Don’t just cut me off like that!\"\nThen, someone grabbed onto Lee Shin Woo’s armor from behind and began shaking him. It was, of course, the sleeping beauty that had belatedly awoken from her second nap, Prince.\n\"How’s this even possible? How can something like this even happen?\"\n\"Please refer those questions to God.\"\n\"You really think I can meet God whenever I want like you!?\"\n\"No, well, I can’t meet Her whenever I want either...\"\nOnce she regained consciousness, she didn’t panic like they’d expected. Rather, she simply asked them for an explanation.\nSo they gave her a detailed explanation. Once they did, she was in disbelief.\n\"If you weren’t going to believe us, then why did you ask for an explanation?\"\n\"A skeleton and skeleton horse were heroes all along...!\"\n\"Don’t believe us then. It’s your choice. Even without you, it doesn’t change much in our fight against the Emperor.\"\n\"What do you mean ’it doesn’t change much’!? Don’t you know how strong I am? I was just feeling under the weather today. If I use my full strength, then...!\"\nLee Shin Woo and Jin were both relieved by her familiar response. They had, unknowingly, gotten attached to her in the time they’d spent together. Lee Shin Woo just smiled at her nonsense and said.\n\"In any case, I am your junior, Senior Prince, so please don’t worry. I’m not entirely sure whether I’m undead or human anymore. Haha.\"\n\"That’s because you’re not normal, Shin Woo.\"\n\"I didn’t even know that my junior was masquerading as the Heaven Defying General and going around the Empire like an idiot...\"\n\"It just turned out that way. By chance.\"\n\"Ugh...\"\nPrince retained her perplexed expression. If she had remained calm, then he would’ve been worried. But her confusion was brief, and she seemed to have made her decision, as she placed her hand on Lee Shin Woo’s shoulder.\n\"You did good! You can rely on me from now on!\"\n\"You talk like you’re actually reliable.\"\n\"Who cares if you’re undead? You’re just missing some muscles and skin!\"\n\"I can make them, you know.\"\n\"Wait, what? You...\"\nShe was probably going to ask what was really on her mind now. Prince briefly hesitated and spoke while pouting.\n\"I lumped all the undead together without thinking about you. Since I thought all undead were on the side of the Empire...\"\n\"...It’s ok. I’m sorry for not telling you earlier. Maybe I was just too afraid.\"\nHe’d concluded that he couldn’t reveal his identity to the heroes due to the undead curse or what not, but seeing her now, Lee Shin Woo realized that perhaps he just hadn’t trusted her enough.\nIn the first place, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t familiar with abstract feelings like trust.\n\"Now that we’re at it, should I tell seniors Lloyd and Erian about me? Jin, don’t you want to try the chatting channel, too?\"\n\"Nope.\"\n\"Ah, wait... Wouldn’t it be better if you did that face-to-face? It’ll be a shock.\"\n\"You really aren’t reliable in important matters, Senior.\"\n\"Why not!? I’m just taking everyone into consideration!\"\nThe mood had certainly relaxed. Fortunately, Dana was someone he could get through to, unlike Seira. Plus, she was friendly and sweet, so she immediately mingled with the group and began talking with them.\nLee Shin Woo thought ’woman are really amazing’ and quietly hurried up... And arrived at the site for the final task remaining in the city.\n\"We’ve arrived.\"\n\"This is... The thorn wall? Can’t we just break it and leave?\"\n\"It’s hard to get into the thorn wall, but it’s not that hard to get out of the wall. Hero, I will...\"\n\"No.\"\nLee Shin Woo ignored the others, disembarked from Jin, and approached the wall. He seemed so defenseless that Dana tried to stop him, but Jin quietly shook her head. Lee Shin Woo then began what he came to do.\n\"Gather. Agglomerate.\"\nHe said just two words and extended his hand, placing it atop the thorn wall. His companions looked on while wondering, ’what is he doing?’ and tilted their heads... Soon, the thorn wall that seemed to wrap around the inner city vibrated and soon after they widened their eyes.\n\"...This isn’t happening, right?\"\n\"The Hero shouldn’t have control over the thorn wall... Ha, I see. He’s using a similar method that he used on the Heaven Rending Cannon with the Proof of Death!\"\nOf course he wasn’t. Even without the Proof of Death, he could control the thorn wall however he wished.\nOnce he told it to gather, the thorn wall obeyed and began to gather. It was no mere magical overlap any longer; it was a complete overlap, or unison!\nThe Evil Eye’s existence had gradually gotten even stronger due to the battle behind its walls. The Evil Eye, poorly processed by man, received Lee Shin Woo’s call and began to awaken from its slumber. It seemingly returned to its proper form.\n\"M-My god... Overlapping matter itself? Did Evil Eye originally possess such an ability? No, that’s impossible. Even the Emperor himself doesn’t possess such a karma.\"\n\"When you see this, it makes you regret destroying the capital’s thorn wall...\"\n\"Wouldn’t it be broken when we get there? We can just pick up the pieces when we’re there.\"\n\"No, I don’t think that’s the issue here. Since the source of darkness, where the Evil Eye ore is mined from, lies within the capital!\"\n’He may be able to devour the very source of darkness as well,’ Dana thought. She watched as the thorn wall, with a circumference of several kilometers, begin to dwindle more and more until it was compressed so much that it could be seen in its entirety with the naked eye. When she saw that, she ended up thinking that.\n\"Shin Woo... What are you going to do with that?\"\nThe others were either shocked, had stopped thinking entirely, or couldn’t understand what was going on, so they kept their mouths shut. On the other hand, Kratia’s eyes shined, just like Lee Shin Woo’s, as she saw the thorn wall gradually reduce in size.\nNow that he thought about it, he’d been so busy since reuniting with her that he hadn’t had a proper conversation with her as of yet. Lee Shin Woo solemnly nodded his head and took out something from his chest. It was the Titan Core. When she saw that, her eyes seemed to radiate light.\n\"Ooh. Oooooh...!\"\n\"It’s already been reinforced with Dark Flame. I’m going to reinforce it with this new ore and create a Titan that integrates all my flames together.\"\n\"Ooooooh! What a cool idea!\"\nHer radiant eyes seemed more blinding than the Heaven Rending Cannon’s beam! In any case, he’d found someone to help him. If Kratia helped him out, then he should be able to create an entirely new golem before the final battle!\nLee Shin Woo let her look over the core some more and concentrated on scaling down and compressing the Evil Eye. He’d already thrown in the piece of Evil Eye he’d picked up before. Around that point, the other heroes completely gave up on understanding what he was doing.\nHow much time had passed? When the space the thorn wall had once occupied was empty, a watermelon sized blackish-red ore was placed before them. It was giving off a truly dreary feeling. Lee Shin Woo gulped and placed his hand atop it.\n[You have acquired the Lv9 Demon Heart.]\n\"Oh. The name’s changed.\"\n\"You used level 6 materials, yet it evolved into a level 9 item...\"\n\"Demon Heart... To think Shin Woo’s heart, which he’d lost by becoming undead, would show up here...\"\n\"Hey.\"\nLee Shin Woo examined the Demon Heart. It was incredibly heavy, but he could somehow lift it with both hands. If he didn’t use the darkness element, then it would’ve been impossible to lift.\nIts weight, its durability, and its magic. All of these were much greater than the original thorn wall. If he hadn’t witnessed the compression process of the thorn wall, then even Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t have imagined that it came from the Evil Eye ore.\n\"Alright. We’ve got everything we came for. Let’s go.\"\n\"But Shin Woo, where are we going? The wine factory?\"\n\"No, we’re going somewhere even better.\"\nIt had existed for several years but was so secretive that it hadn’t been discovered by the Emperor. Lee Shin Woo knew of its location and had just recently become the owner of it.\n\"The Metal Army’s secret base. No, let’s call it our base now.\"\n\"You demon... That’s definitely Shin Woo’s heart.\"\n\"Heaven Defying General Paul Zero... So cool.\"\nJin shook her head and muttered, but Kratia nodded her head, as though she were impressed by anything Paul Zero did. Seeing that, Prince just said thoughtlessly.\n\"I’m hungry. Let’s eat when we get there.\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 48. - Premature Family Plan - 3>\nNo matter how hungry Prince was, or how much Kratia wanted to study the Titan Core, there was something else they had to do beforehand. It was collecting the loot from the battle.\nLee Shin Woo’s party safely got out of Bayran and then gathered with the android Chi Pauls, the Chi Pauls that had already withdrawn from the city, and the Giants; he praised them for their hard work and then reinforced them with the bones that were gathered.\n[Thank you very much, Lord Paul Zero!]\n\"There’s not much time left. Are you all ready?\"\n[We all saw the light that you unleashed, Lord Paul Zero. We’re prepared to sacrifice everything for you at any time!]\n[Glory to the Titan!]\n\"Alright, good. Those who haven’t been reinforced yet, come forward!\"\nHe first reinforced them, fully healing them and strengthening them. Then, they hid within one of their nearby bases and got back on track.\n\"What a huge army! No matter how I look at it, those Giants don’t fit at all...!\"\n\"Haha. They’re just a portion of my army. Ah, some of my forces are also on the surface. This is a secret, but Jin Jin already knows about me and is doing something for me on the surface.\"\n\"Even Ye Jin Jin!? I’m the senior here, but I’ve never been to the surface before...!\"\n\"All the citizens of the Underground Empire yearn to go the surface, yet you so easily...\"\nHe’d managed to collect the thorn wall, the loot, as well as the forces he’d brought with him.\nBy the time he was finished with all that, Lee Shin Woo was about to activate the Heaven Door’s Key but remembered that he had some things to do before going to the Metal Army’s base. Therefore, he decided to visit the wine factory first, which was near the level 3 danger zone.\nPlus, most of the materials that Kratia had studied had been left there, and above all, he needed to check on the progress of the wine. The source of thɪs content is Nov3lFɪre.ɴet\n\"Junior, you’re good at cooking food with oil.\"\n\"Well, this is how it turns out when a man cooks.\"\n\"...One more bowl.\"\nOnce the long, exhausting battle was over, Lee Shin Woo cooked meat fried rice over high heat (he called it high heat, but he was actually using his Lv7 High Rank Fire element) for his companions, who yearned for food more than anything else.\nThe best way to prepare delicious food when one couldn’t cook well was to use delicious ingredients and prepare them in the simplest way! Of course, everyone liked his food.\n\"It’s quite delicious, Hero. There’s nothing you can’t do.\"\n\"There’re things Shin Woo can’t do. Like fighting head-to-head.\"\n\"Jin, aren’t you being too hard on me lately? Ah, we have soup too.\"\nHe also prepared a soup using a variety of vegetables from the surface; the soup’s base tasted like something between soybean paste and soy sauce, and he let it come to a roaring boil. Because he prepared it so simply, it tasted good. It was quite mild compared to the rich fried rice, yet it was nonetheless filled with flavor, making the two dishes a good match.\n\"This soup is delicious! Why didn’t you cook before, if you were so good at it?\"\n\"I couldn’t eat before, so I didn’t really want to cook for other people.\"\n\"You’re really honest... Ah, give me another bowl too!\"\nBut now, he could enjoy food. He tried his best to ignore Jin’s betrayed look and ate some more fried rice. Right now, he felt like he had made the right call to pursue a human body.\nHowever, Jin wasn’t the only one staring at him. He turned around, looked at the almost completely still woman, and tilted his head.\n\"What, you’re not eating? You can eat too, you know.\"\n\"How can you be so... nonchalant about all this...\"\nShe, the Elder Banshee Princess, Seira Von Retadane’s hands shook in rage. But she couldn’t just throw away her bowl of food, so she placed it onto the floor, pointed her finger at Lee Shin Woo, and said.\n\"We have something else to talk about! Because of you, I turned into this...! Plus, I turned into an undead! How can you be so calm and eat as if nothing happened when Lee Shin Woo has been hiding the fact that he’s been undead this entire time!? How is that even possible? How can you eat his food without a care in the world!?\"\n\"I already knew a while back, so it doesn’t matter.\"\n\"Mm... I know he’s not a bad guy, so there’s no helping it. Moreover, he’s my junior! Plus, he doesn’t smell like he’s dead! From the outside... oh, I guess it’s the same on the inside too. He’s completely human; more importantly, he’s on my side!\"\nKratia answered immediately. Prince, with her lips smeared with oily rice, also came to his defense, though she was extremely biased.\nWhereas, Jin, who was likewise an undead hero like Lee Shin Woo, said nothing. The Immoral Princess Dana, who had been eating her third bowl of fried rice, looked at her close friend and former fiance’s younger sister and laughed.\n\"Seira, you’ve been freed of the undead curse. You shouldn’t waste your time being dissatisfied and throwing a tantrum. If it wasn’t for the Hero, then you wouldn’t be able to eat this delicious food. I’m in the same boat as well.\"\n\"Dana...!\"\nAlthough the two’s species were completely different, one being an Immortal while the other was a Banshee, as well as one being alive and the other undead, their situation was the same. They were given another chance at life by Lee Shin Woo. And on the same day at that.\n\"It’s a blessing, Seira. You’re happy you’re alive, right? Being able to move forward; it’s such a precious thing. Moreover, didn’t the Hero say that it didn’t matter what we looked like? What matters is that we’re here, alive.\"\n\"But thus far he’s completely...\"\n\"It doesn’t matter if he’s deceived you. You know why he had to lie to you, Seira.\"\n\"I... I still can’t accept this. This isn’t what I chose. This is contract fraud.\"\n\"Tch. She found out.\"\nHe figured she’d be happy that he saved her, but it seems like she was still going through puberty. Lee Shin Woo was about to say something, but Dana winked at him. She was telling him to leave it to her.\n\"The Hero was willing to go that far to save you and give you another chance. At the time, you couldn’t make a rational decision, could you? Why don’t you first think about why he saved you when he normally cuts down his enemies without mercy.\"\n\"...Dana.\"\n\"I know, Seira. There’s too much that happened all at once for you to accept it. Mulling things over is a good thing. But Seira, let’s take it slow, step by step and think about things together. There’s no need to rush. We can be together from now on. ...Ah, but there is one thing.\"\nDana’s motherly speech caused even Seira’s expression to soften. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo realized that not just anyone could be a princess. During that time, Dana’s attitude changed.\nHer emotions had intensified, signaling to him that she was instinctively gathering various types of elemental mana.\n\"One thing we can’t take slow is our revenge. To be honest, I really don’t care what happens to the surface from now on, but I must take my revenge on my father, who bound me for so many years and made me like this; as well as his forces and my fiance who abandoned me.\"\n\"Dana.\"\n\"Can you help me, Seira? Could you trust me and the Hero, and help us?\"\nHe’d already formed an official contract with her, so he didn’t need to check what she was thinking. But even knowing that, Dana still gave Seira the chance to make her own decision.\nAs she said, she was starting small; she was trying to resolve Seira’s countless contradictions and aspirations one-by-one. Did she succeed? Seira soon sighed and shook her head.\n\"Stop speaking nonsense, Dana. I know already. That I already made my choice... At this point, I’m just spitting on my own face.\"\nShe’s right. She was just wasting time. However, she picked up the bowl of fried rice and soup again, so Lee Shin Woo decided not to intervene. Dana looked satisfied with herself as she backed off.\n\"Hoo, hoo. If you already know, then there’s nothing more I have to say.\"\n\"But I do have a question. Why are acting so close to Lee Shin Woo? I’m pretty sure you’ve only known him for a few hours, so why are you acting like that? Did he brainwash you?\"\n\"Oh my.\"\nDana’s eyes lit up. Jin, who sensed something unusual going on, kicked Lee Shin Woo, but he was actually innocent this time. He’d already formed an official contract with her, and there was no need to enter a relationship with her, so why would he be attracted to her!?\n\"He hasn’t brainwashed me, Seira. I just felt fated to be with him, that’s all. Think about it, Seira. It would be strange if I hadn’t fallen for him; a brave hero saving me from all that pain and suffering.\"\n\"That kind of pure and beautiful love only shows up in fairytales; it doesn’t often work out that way. Moreover, why are you calling him Hero? There’s a limit to being old-fashioned.\"\n\"Hoo. You were always so pessimistic, Seira. That’s why men didn’t approach you.\"\n\"What... That goes for you as well!\"\n\"I already had a fiance before I was even born, so I couldn’t even dream of love!\"\nAh, it was going so well, but they started arguing over an unexpected topic! The level 8 Banshee and Immortal were looking at each other so seriously! Lee Shin Woo stood up in a fluster.\n\"If you’re done eating, then should I bring out the dessert? I’ve cooled some wine jelly, so I’ll just bring it right up!\"\n\"...Not yet. I’ll soon finish eating, so please wait a little longer.\"\nHowever, Seira herself stopped Lee Shin Woo. She glared at Dana, as if deeply unsatisfied (for her, it was quite the rare expression) and then began to eat some fried rice.\nThe fact that she was eating her food meant that she accepted the situation. He thought she’d throw a tantrum before calming down, but things had surprisingly gone better than expected.\nLee Shin Woo sat back down, and Seira looked at him with a satisfied, yet lukewarm expression, as though something was bland; her skin was paler now that she was an undead, making her lips more alluring than before. She pouted and said.\n\"The fried rice and soup were delicious.\"\n\"...I’m glad to hear it.\"\n\"Eut...\"\nWhile Seira was eating, Lee Shin Woo finished his work in the wine factory and called the Dryads, who were hiding due to the shock from unexpected visitors. He introduced them to Dana and as expected, they were really happy to see her.\n\"There really were living spirits left in the Underground Empire! Ah, what a joyous occasion...\"\n[It’s nice to meet you, Princess.]\n[It’s the famous princess. She’s not human, but she’s still alive!]\n[I smell Paul Zero from her. She must’ve formed a contract with Paul Zero!]\n[So that’s why she’s still alive! She smells good.]\n[Want to play with us? Want to imitate Paul Zero?]\nDana brightened up immediately. The others’ mood brightened as well. Jin followed Dana and began conversing with the Dryads as well.\nHe’d wondered how this would go a while back, but it seemed like it had all worked out. Lee Shin Woo sighed in relief and drew in her empty bowl from behind. It was shining as if he didn’t even need to wash it. Lee Shin Woo took it and stared at her. Then, Seira added in an unnecessary explanation.\n\"...In the Empire, eating everything off your plate is the greatest compliment to the chef. It’s not because I was hungry.\"\n\"So that’s why everyone ate everything.\"\n\"B-But... Didn’t you used to speak politely to me?\"\n\"We’ve formed a master-servant contract, so wouldn’t me speaking politely be kind of weird? And it’s not my style anyway.\"\n\"I see.\"\nHe played along with Prince because it was fun. Lee Shin Woo took the bowl and threw it into his inventory. Seira watched vacantly as he did so and added.\n\"My inventory’s disappeared. How unfortunate; I wanted to brew a cup of tea for you in exchange for the meal.\"\n\"Eh, I can just buy you a teapot and some tea leaves later.\"\n\"...Is that so? Thank you.\"\nSeira thanked him and nodded her head. He thought that’d be it, so he turned around, but she grabbed onto him once more.\n\"Now... I don’t have to cling to the Retadane name anymore. It’s all because of you.\"\n\"Man, you really have to pin everything on me?\"\n\"...So, you can call me Seira now.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I’m going to try living as Banshee Seira from now on. ...That’s all.\"\nSeira turned around and left. He watched her, dumbfounded, and Jin, who’d come back secretly, kicked him once more. He couldn’t tell why she’d done that at all.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 48 part4",
    "content": "<Chapter 48. - Premature Family Plan - 4>\nLee Shin Woo was barely able to get Dana to part with the Dryads by promising to introduce her to the spirits on the surface. Then, he and his party left the wine factory and traveled to the Metal Army’s base.\nIf he hadn’t acquired the administrator seal and been to their base before, then he wouldn’t have been able to lead them into the chaos; and if that happened, he would’ve had to work that much harder to lower the Imperial Army and the Anti-Skull’s forces.\n\"Moreover, it’s because of that that we got ourselves such a nice facility.\"\n\"That’s really not the way a human being thinks.\"\n\"Wow. I didn’t know you could use golems like this...\"\n\"I’m really satisfied.\"\n\"It’s quite vast. To think they built and operated a hidden facility like this...\"\nThey had taken the golem train and arrived at the Metal Army’s base. While the younger generation of heroes looked around, as if fascinated, Seira and Dana were absolutely speechless.\nOf course, they realized by now that Arema Steelworker was a spy from the surface, but they hadn’t expected such an expansive facility being run under the entire Empire in the past; even when the Underground Empire was still thriving.\n\"It’s because of this that they were able to move so covertly.\"\n\"I’m surprised you were able to recreate that seal or what not, Hero. It’s not easy to do, even for a magician.\"\nThe Empire had the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin, but even he wasn’t able to find this base. This base had existed for far too long for him to blame it on them becoming undead. Lee Shin Woo just shrugged his shoulders.\n\"Now that you mention it, I feel like it’s because of my innate ability. Ah, using Bone Reinforcement on the golems helped too, since it lets me look at them closely.\"\n\"I see. It’s a combination of your talent and your disposition.\"\n\"Makes sense. Let’s take a look, starting from the outside.\"\nThey passed the golem train terminal and first encountered a long, outside corridor. There were a few huge rooms and warehouses, but all of them were empty.\nHe assumed that they were originally filled with his troops: level 6 golems. They were, of course, in his Chi Pauls’ bellies now.\n\"But this shouldn’t be all there is.\"\n\"They should have a golem manufacturing facility somewhere.\"\nHe was well aware of this, as he’d killed some of them. There were, of course, golems that had been created dozens of years ago, but there had also been golems with recent production numbers among them.\nWhile spying on the Underground Empire, Arema Steelworker had also been increasing his forces. His party had finished looking through the outer corridors, and then went towards the inner facilities, which couldn’t be accessed without the Steelworker seal; they were really excited, and...\n\"Ooooooh!\"\n\"Oh, it’s over there.\" Newest update provıded by novｅlfire.net\nKratia’s yell resounded as if sounding fanfare. The party soon entered a huge room filled with devices and mysterious crystals. Above all, both walls were adorned with vaults filled with level 6 Original Cores. Once she saw the cores, she couldn’t contain her excitement.\n\"Kratia, is this...\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nKratia nodded her head enthusiastically as if deeply moved. Whenever she was introduced to a new, unknown magical technique, she tended to get really excited.\n\"A manufacturing facility that produces a large quantity of Original Cores... It really did exist. The surface’s magic engineering is amazing!\"\n\"Kratia, you seem a bit different.\"\n\"Uooooh!\"\nKratia completely ignored Prince and uttered a sound, as if she were a human power plant, and rushed over to the magical device and began to observe it.\nHe would feel bad if he interrupted her since she was concentrating so hard. Lee Shin Woo decided to leave this entire facility to Kratia and looked through the other facilities. He looked through the golems’ weapon storehouse, the material storehouse, the golem production facility, as well as the repair facility... Even Lee Shin Woo had gotten excited from looking through these storehouses that remained intact for dozens of years.\n\"I should be able to expand the golem squad significantly!\"\n\"Oh God.\"\n\"God’ll like it too. Probably.\"\nBy the time he’d gone through about 80% of the inner facilities, Lee Shin Woo found one of the things he was looking for. It was the golem terminal that remotely controlled the railroad.\n\"Jin, do you remember what that Steelworker bastard told us last time? It was when we still had to get their permission to use the golem trains.\"\n\"Did they even say anything important regarding the trains?\"\n\"They did. It was incredibly important info at that. They definitely told us that they had a line that went directly to the capital.\"\n\"The capital!? Oh my god!\"\n\"There’s a line that goes directly to the capital!?\"\nDana and Seira, who’d both been quietly listening in, yelled in astonishment. They should know exactly what this meant! Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and added.\n\"I’m pretty sure it was Guillotine. He said that ’In the process of escaping the capital, we completely destroyed the passageway and the road was closed.’\"\n\"He must’ve been lying.\"\n\"He was lying.\"\nThey had been fighting like prepubescent girls before, but now they were agreeing with each other. Lee Shin Woo felt that their relationship was really entertaining and nodded his head.\n\"It’s obviously a lie. If that line was discovered, then whether they closed the road or not wouldn’t have mattered; the Imperial Army would’ve gotten through. At the time, I didn’t know what high level individuals could do, so I assumed they were telling the truth and let it go, but now that I’m level 8, I know. Their line was never discovered after escaping the capital. And that’s why they were able to continue using this base.\"\n\"Impossible... It’s preposterous...\"\n\"Arema Steelworker. He truly was looking down on the Underground Empire. It frustrates me that we never even knew about this. We were playing in the palm of his hand...\"\nDana and Seira were in sync as if they’d made arrangements beforehand. The more pissed they were, the more aggressively they would fight. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head in satisfaction and said.\n\"In any case, that’s why, at the time, I hadn’t used the line to go to the capital. But now’s different. I thought there’d be a facility that controlled access to the line inside... Hoo. It was really here.\"\n\"You thought this far ahead? Ah, as expected of a hero hand-picked by God...\"\nDana looked at Lee Shin Woo as if she were a love struck girl. In response, Seira looked at Dana with a sullen expression and said.\n\"I wanted to say this before, but there are a lot more heroes picked by God than just Lee Shin Woo, Dana.\"\n\"But what were you all doing while the Hero was doing all this?\"\n\"Ugh. We were... We were also...\"\n\"I know! Popcorn! This is where we eat popcorn, right?\"\n\"Prince, you’re really...\"\nWhile they were noisily chatting in the background, Lee Shin Woo carefully looked at the device. Without the Steelworker seal, he couldn’t even approach it; it was set up that way. What’s worse, it couldn’t be controlled without Arema Steelworker’s seal.\n’But that won’t stop me anymore.’\nLee Shin Woo was level 8 and he had the Wild Card skill now. Even if he didn’t absorb Arema Steelworker, he was skilled enough to create the right seal, so long as he knew how the device’s locking mechanism worked!\nHonestly, he could make it even easier and just use his Shining Flame to erase the lock’s cause-and-effect or his Dark flame to steal ownership of the device. He could also use his Dark Shadow to reverse its locked state and open it and had several other methods available to him as well, but he decided to just make the seal.\n\"Alright. It really is open.\"\n\"We can go to the capital!? Directly!?\"\n\"If that’s the case, then... Then, now that the capital’s defense mechanisms are gone, then we can just take this train and...\"\n\"Yep. We can just ignore their monsters and attack their life points directly.\" [1]\nOf course, he didn’t mean that they would go right away. He still had lots he needed to prepare. But now he had a reliable way of traveling to the capital whenever he wanted.\n\"The final battle... truly is near.\"\n\"It’s not going to be the final battle. Since some of the undead curse has spread to the surface already. Moreover, the Magic Emperor’s no joke, so we can only relax and live in peace once he’s out of the picture.\"\n\"The undead curse is affecting the surface...\"\nDana, who was quietly listening to him, scowled. Lee Shin Woo glanced at her, and once he noticed his gaze, she lightly sighed and said.\n\"I’m not sure if you know this or not, but killing my father... Killing the Emperor won’t completely eliminate the curse.\"\n\"Huh? What do you mean... Ah, are you talking about that source or what not?\"\n\"Yes, exactly.\"\nSeira had told him about it before. The reason they were able to mine Evil Eye was because the source of darkness, which had revived the Empire, had been close by.\nThe ore that had been affected by said darkness was already so powerful, so how insanely powerful would the source itself be? It was scary just thinking about it.\n\"Why didn’t they equip that to the cannon and fire it? They would’ve been able to break through the barrier that way, right?\"\n\"But that would’ve destroyed both the underground and the surface. That’s just how powerful the source is. And the Emperor already used that to create the undead curse.\"\n\"Thanks for explaining it in a way that I could understand right away.\"\n\"It was truly foolish. He didn’t even think about the consequences and just went ahead with it. He used the source of darkness as the base of the undead curse, so the curse itself doesn’t weaken. Once the Emperor is killed, something must be done about the source for the curse to fade away.\"\n\"...Hmm.\"\nLee Shin Woo felt like he’d be able to do something about the source of darkness with his abilities. But he was concerned about something: what if the Emperor decided to use the source against him?\nHe wouldn’t do that unless he was crazy, but he was already crazy, so there was still a chance he’d use it!\n\"Is that source or whatever always next to the Emperor?\"\n\"Processing it is possible, but it’s difficult to move it, even for the Emperor himself. It’s probably exactly where I remember it.\"\n\"...I see. Well, I guess it’ll just work out.\"\nHe would first get the Emperor and the Lich away from the source. He would kill the Emperor after taking care of the source. Since he had Seira and Dana on his side, both of which had detailed information on the capital, it shouldn’t be too difficult.\n\"But the question’s how we take care of the two Liches.\"\n\"Let’s first think about where their life vessels may be hidden within the capital.\"\n\"No need...\"\nThe party debated over the final battle, but then, the door opened and a small ice magician entered. Her hands were full of blueprints, which looked pretty cute.\n\"Since I found out a way to improve the Huginn’s Eye.\"\nKratia declared confidently. Huginn’s Eye? That level 8 artifact that they used to sense golems or the undead? He briefly tilted his head, but his eyes soon widened.\nWhen the culmination of the surface’s magic engineering met with another world’s magic, the story (the day before the final battle) would truly commence...!\n[1] T/N: Yu-Gi-Oh! or possibly some other TCG reference.",

    "content": "<Chapter 48. - Premature Family Plan - 5>\nTo Prince, the Metal Army’s base was a safe hiding place, but to Seira and Dana, it was a place that allowed them to ruminate over their anger. To Lee Shin Woo, it was a golem manufacturing facility, as well as a beachhead that would allow him a direct route to attack the capital. And finally, to Kratia, is was like a treasure vault.\n\"As expected. Another world’s magic engineering’s impressive. I see unlimited potential.\"\n\"I’m not so sure, but if you think so, I’m sure it’s true.\"\nIt’s been so long since Kratia had last been so energetic. Then again, it made sense. After all, she’d underwent special training in battle magic, so she hadn’t had enough time to study anything. But following the battle, she had projects like the Titan or the Huginn’s Eye to look forward to, so...\nNormally, one would loathe an increased workload, but she got excited over it like a pervert. ’It’s a bit upsetting, but people like her probably revolutionize the world,’ he thought vaguely and finished up all the tasks he needed to do here. He’d only pulled the lever on the far right side, yet he heard a loud noise from afar.\n\"Now we can go to the capital whenever we want.\"\n\"...I’m getting tense.\"\n\"It’s not like we’re going right away.\"\nIf he could, he’d like to reach level 9 before then. Moreover, he wanted to complete the Titan before then as well. If there were a Hyperbolic Time Chamber lying around somewhere, then he’d go in, undergo strict mana training, and reach level 9 no matter what, but... It was most unfortunate that he didn’t have the time right now.\n\"It’s all Seagald’s fault.\"\n\"But it was ultimately you who pulled the trigger, Lee Shin Woo.\"\n\"Giving me the cold, hard truth isn’t good for my mental health, so can you not...?\"\nThere was one last thing he needed to find, so he exited the room and perused the other facilities more quickly than before. There was still Arema’s room, as well as a place similar to the command and control center (where all the golems’ situation reports were directed to) to get to.\nThere was also a storehouse filled with emergency-use consumable magical devices as well. And...\n\"Found it.\"\n\"It’s really dark. What’s the room even for?\"\n\"Don’t move. If you set foot into this room without Arema’s seal, a ton of traps will activate.\"\nJust how important could it be, for the security of this particular room to be even stricter than the command and control center, or the device that remotely controlled the tracks. The party didn’t know why they had to, but they followed Lee Shin Woo’s instructions and waited outside. Lee Shin Woo used Arema’s seal and then went into the room.\nAt that moment, the once dark room lighted up. It was an extremely small room. Aside from the lights, all that could be seen was a small table, a crystal that lay atop it, and a chair.\n\"What kind of treasure is it, for them to go so far to protect it?\"\n\"This isn’t a treasure. This is the Empire’s most dangerous ’switch’.\"\n\"Switch...?\"\n\"Ah, is it...!?\"\nIt seems like Dana was the first to realize what it was. Lee Shin Woo strode into the room and placed his hand atop the crystal.\nAs expected, it was a device that would send a signal somewhere through the infusion of mana. Moreover, it used darkness element mana as a foundation to connect you to someone far away. This is...\n\"A communication device. Moreover, it’s a communication line unaffected by the barrier.\"\nThe reason for it being unaffected by the barrier was extremely simple. This communication device was created by the same person who’d made the barrier... In other words, it was created by the surface’s Magic Emperor. He ignored the others, who widened their eyes, and calmly sat in the chair. Newest update provıded by novelfire(.)net\n\"What are you doing!? Are you going to declare war on the Emperor!?\"\n\"You dumbass. There’s no way I’d do that.\"\nLee Shin Woo scolded Jin and tapped his cheek. With that, his face and armor began to change. It was an unbelievable change, even to those witnessing it firsthand. What’s worse, the group couldn’t even sense any magic, so they watched dumbfoundedly.\n[Why are you so surprised? I can switch between a human and an undead, so why wouldn’t I be able to turn into a golem too?]\n\"No, you... Your mana presence too.\"\n\"Arema Steelworker. If I hadn’t seen this with my own two eyes, then I would’ve thought that Arema Steelworker had returned from the dead. My god. How?\"\n\"When I transformed the Chimeras, I received some info on Arema too. ...Ah, with my current abilities, I could imitate him pretty well without it though.\"\nAt that time, everyone realized what his intentions were. They were just speechless. Lee Shin Woo was trying to do something unbelievable!\nLee Shin Woo told his party to remain quiet just in case, and even told them to even stand far away from him. After that, he made sure his disguise was perfect and activated Wild Card while sifting through Arema’s memories. This skill would conceal any awkwardness of his.\n\"Done.\"\nHe stepped far enough away from the crystal and then infused his mana into it. Lee Shin Woo waited a short while and then, a person’s face appeared on the crystal. Someone he couldn’t meet no matter what he’d done on the surface... The surface’s Emperor had appeared.\nHe’d indirectly met the Magic Emperor before. At the time, the Emperor had been controlling the Evileye General, Shurina Von Hegel, so Lee Shin Woo could recognize him immediately. This was the real deal, the true Magic Emperor. He wasn’t borrowing another person’s body this time. He had shown up in his true form.\nThen again, he supposed there was no reason for the Emperor to put up a facade in front of the general he’d sent underground.\n[Arema.]\n[Your Majesty.]\nThere was no reason to waste time between them. Arema had served the Magic Emperor for several years and they shared the same beliefs. They could tell what the other was thinking without even saying it.\n[So there’s been a change underground.]\n[That’s correct.]\n[Report, my loyal friend.]\nYet, Lee Shin Woo was fooling that very Emperor!\n[Anti-Skull has made their stand. The exiles were transformed into Anti-Skull and Seagald was attempting to break through the barrier. He’s an irregular. He’s not like a normal undead; the most dangerous type of individual.]\n[So... are you saying that he can move forward? Truly?]\n[It’s truly unbelievable, but... That’s correct. I was forced to sacrifice the Four Heavenly Commanders to find that out...]\nLee Shin Woo had figured out how Arema or the Magic Emperor referred to the denizens underground when Chi Paul had absorbed Arema’s body and had become an Android. He couldn’t sift through the memories in any detail, but it was the bare minimum to imitate Arema Steelworker.\n[...Seagald. A descendant of the Retadanes.]\n[...]\nA voice filled with profound emotion. He didn’t know what else to say, so he remained quiet, but being silent was what Arema Steelworker would do here as well. As one of his vassals, asking about the Emperor’s personal feelings was impermissible!\nHow long did he remain silent? The Emperor suddenly spoke.\n[The Retadane family still had that much power left? He must be level 8. Am I right?]\n[That’s correct. But he uses some unknown power. Flames... Flames that control everything.]\n[Flames...?]\nThe Emperor narrowed his eyes. Lee Shin Woo acted like he hadn’t noticed this and raised his voice.\n[That’s correct. Flames that could both hide and disguise himself... I’ve never seen flames like it. If he didn’t have such an unusual ability, Stake wouldn’t have been killed. I wasn’t careful enough!]\n[Hides and disguises him...? An innate element...?]\n[Your Majesty?]\n[Move forward? Doesn’t act like an undead, but acts like a human being?]\nThe Emperor was in deep thought. If he acted like he hadn’t noticed this as well, then it’d show. Lee Shin Woo questioned and the Emperor asked once more.\n[What else did you find out about him?]\n[I was able to steal one of his weapons in exchange for one of my subordinates. It was broken, but we’ve managed to preserve its shape. But does this hold any significance...]\n[Show me.]\n[Yes, Your Majesty.]\nLee Shin Woo showed him the weapon he’d prepared beforehand. What was it, you say? It was a bisected Fire Dragon’s Scale Greatsword.\n[...Ha.]\nThe Emperor laughed.\n[Hahahahahaha!]\nThe room reverberated with his laughter.\n[Your Majesty!? Did you figure something out...?]\n[Yes indeed! I didn’t think I’d see him again, but that’s where he was!]\nThe Emperor raised his voice, as if it would pierce the heavens themselves. The fury and the humiliation in his voice...! Lee Shin Woo acted like he couldn’t understand, but then widened his eyes as if he’d come to a sudden realization.\n[Your Majesty, is that...? The surface! That’s impossible! Are you saying that he’s already gone to the surface!?]\n[I thought I’d killed him. I was arrogant. I thought he was some foolish hero, but I was wrong. It’s been a long time since I’ve made a mistake like this. He acted like he was dead. A wielder of an innate fire element should’ve seen through my Lightning Bind. They wouldn’t have been killed so easily! What a show. Retadane. He wasn’t raised as the successor of light, but as an entertainer on a stage!]\nThe Emperor’s voice kept rising and falling. Lee Shin Woo groaned quietly and the Emperor added.\n[There was an individual who rapidly increased his influence with the backing of merchants and religious orders. I assumed he was one of the heroes summoned underground, so I took care of him immediately, but his successor soon appeared, who could wield his power, albeit poorly. I was trying to figure out when I could kill her, but... My assumption was wrong. They’re nothing more than pawns that were sacrificed by him.]\n[Cut the tail...]\n[Indeed.]\nLee Shin Woo presumed. The Emperor gritted his teeth and nodded his head.\n[He moved as he pleased by acting like a muscle-headed hero, but he must’ve went back underground when he’d gotten all he needed. He left behind such good bait (the religious orders), diverted my attention, and hid himself, acting as though he were dead!]\n[How dare that traitor... Your Majesty, if you just give me another chance, I promise to catch him and present his head to you!]\n[No. You won’t be enough.]\nLee Shin Woo gritted his teeth and declared. Then, the Emperor stood up. That pale skin and the protruding fangs. He must’ve sucked blood just recently, as his teeth were stained with blood.\n[I’ll send you reinforcements. These lowly peasants don’t know their place and weren’t satisfied being underground, so they dare bare their fangs at me? Then, I’ll just catch them all and crush them...!]\n[As you wish, Your Majesty!]\n[My loyal friend, Arema. Can you figure out where they are?]\n[If you just give me a little more time, then I can figure out where they’re hiding!]\n[Excellent. The day your suffering is at an end and you return to the surface, I’ll give you everything you could want!]\nThe line went dead. Just in case, he remained in that posture for a little longer. Once he confirmed that the line was dead, he inspected the communication device once more, stepped outside, and closed the door while maintaining Arema’s form.\n\"Nice. That’s one thing off my list!\"\nThen, Lee Shin Woo returned to his hero form and smiled refreshingly.\n\"Junior, what did you just do?\"\n\"Ah, nothing much.\"\nLee Shin Woo waved his hand and replied.\n\"I told you that I was on the surface for a while, right? While I was there, I acted like a hero who could wield flames. But when I met Seagald, I was like ’He can wield flames too?’. So, I thought I could blame Seagald for everything.\"\n\"...Is it really that easy?\"\n\"People who aren’t at the site of the crime normally take a few clues and come to a conclusion themselves, so if I were to twist those clues around, then it’s easy to fool them.\"\nLee Shin Woo had left the surface very subtly. He was caught in a huge explosion, so no one could ascertain whether he had survived or not, and a successor had even appeared soon after. The Magic Emperor had been leery of this.\nBut then he’d met Seagald, the only undead who didn’t act like an undead, who could not only use an innate element, but also used a sword as his primary weapon. It would be strange if the Emperor didn’t suspect Seagald.\nAnd if that happened, it would become easier for him to claim that his words to the Emperor were an act. Though in reality, it was all an act.\n\"Well, it would’ve been annoying to have to worry about both Anti-Skull and the palace. I figured the Magic Emperor could take care of Anti-Skull for us, so I improvised.\"\n\"That was... improvised...? I thought everything was planned out from the start...\"\n\"It was obviously improvised. Ha. Now that you mention it, I was worried about leaving Jin Jin alone on the surface, but with this, the Emperor won’t worry about the religious orders as much. I have to figure out where the Anti-Skull’s main base is and tell the Emperor ASAP.\"\n\"...\"\nLee Shin Woo hummed as he walked through the corridor. Everyone else was speechless. Kratia, who had been quietly watching him, murmured.\n\"The wicked Heaven Defying General. He’s so cool.\"",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 48 part6",
    "content": "<Chapter 48. - Premature Family Plan - 6>\nOnce he’d finished going through the base and lying to the Magic Emperor, the group gathered in one spot and discussed their future plans.\nOf their many tasks, they first had to prioritize improving the Huginn’s Eye, rather than working on golems or the Titan. The reason being quite simple.\n\"We need to find out where the Lich’s life vessel is, but it’s more important that we find out where Seagald is hiding and report it to the Emperor.\"\n\"Whenever you’re doing something evil, you’re smarter than everyone else, Shin Woo.\"\n\"Hey, people will misunderstand. Call it a way of survival. You think I’m doing this to save myself? I’m doing this so we can all survive.\"\n\"You should’ve just kept acting as Paul Zero.\"\n\"They’ll misunderstand. Ah, I feel a headache coming, so don’t explain it. It’s fine.\"\nAside from that, they decided what tasks they needed to complete in order to attain victory in the final battle. He decided to focus on improving the Titan (which now used the Demon Heart), creating cores and golems, and repairing the Heaven Defying Flag Bearer, which had broken to pieces in the previous battle.\nUnfortunately, Lee Shin Woo was forced to leave all that to Kratia. But Kratia looked happy to be undertaking that massive workload instead.\n\"Junior, if Kratia’s busy doing other stuff, then what do I do, since I was learning magic from her? Hmm? Pop some popcorn?\"\nMost seniors wouldn’t pass this kind of responsibility to their juniors, but that was precisely Prince’s charm; she didn’t even recognize those norms and did away with them.\nLee Shin Woo patted her head in satisfaction. She acted as if she hated it, but she was actually quite pleased; her image as a senior was completely broken at this point. Seeing that, Kratia looked at her as if she were hopeless and said.\n\"You’ve got the basics down, so practice by yourself from now on. A real battle would be best.\"\n\"A real battle, huh... Ah, Senior. Would you like to go to the surface instead?\"\n\"Ah, really? I can go up to the surface? Really?\"\nPrince’s eyes widened at Lee Shin Woo’s suggestion. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and explained.\n\"The only thing we can do here is invade the capital. It’s dangerous outside, so it’s difficult to move freely, right?\"\n\"If I’m not traveling with you, then yeah... You’re right. I wonder how Lloyd and Erian are doing.\"\n\"Now that you mention it, you’re right. If they’re hiding in a dungeon, they’ll remain safe, but if they leave... I guess I should explain it to them too.\"\nThe biggest pain in the ass was the heroes not currently present. It was obvious that it would get bloody underground, and if Lee Shin Woo just left the other heroes be, they might die all of a sudden.\nThat’s not all. While Lloyd was level 7 and was thus barely qualified to participate in the final battle, Erian would cling to Lloyd like glue... though he at least needed to know how things were going.\nAnd if they wanted to fight together in the final battle, then... it would be best to stop them.\n\"Then can’t you just send those two to the surface too, Shin Woo?\"\n\"I thought about that, but I feel like it’s not such a good idea...\"\n\"What a coincidence. I agree.\"\nAside from the fact that Erian was an elf, a species unseen on the surface, Lloyd was the model hero who’d show up in fairytales. If he sent him to the surface, then he’d cause a lot of trouble for him 100%. He might even die faster there than if he were here.\n\"Then I’ll leave them be for now. I’ll explain things to them later. Senior Prince, please think about it. If you decide to go to the surface, then I can have Jin Jin help or I can help you do things on your own. I’ve identified several dungeons, and going to the surface is best if you’re looking for rapid growth.\"\n\"Junior...!\"\n\"But if you catch the Emperor’s attention, then you will die. He’s level 9.\"\n\"Junior!\"\nPrince was tearing up but ultimately decided to go to the surface. If she wanted to get used to the new Fire Demon summoning spell that she’d developed with Kratia and grow, then going to the surface was the best option. There was honestly only one viable option for her.\n\"You’re not planning on invading the capital without me, are you? Right? You saw how strong my Fire Demon was, right?\"\n\"Yes, yes. I promise I’ll go with you when the time comes, so please don’t die. More importantly, how many of the 12 Generals are left?\"\n\"I have an idea. But first, Lee Shin Woo, could you please tell us about all the members of the 12 Generals you’ve killed thus far?\"\nThis time it was Seira. Lee Shin Woo thought back and went down the list one-by-one. Seira and the others were absolutely speechless.\n\"To think you killed five of them yourself... I had my suspicions, but you really were the one who killed the Beast General! I thought it was strange that the loot was so sparse!\"\n\"Of course. You should be thankful that I let you finish off the Vulture General. Though I was busy rescuing Lloyd and taking care of Ethan Cruz. Do you guys even realize how close you all were to turning undead then?\"\n\"Junior, are you some sort of fairytale protagonist? You do all the dirty work and protect everyone. ...That’s pretty cool!\"\nSeira had ended up killing the Vulture General, but if Lee Shin Woo and Kratia hadn’t prepared their countermeasures so thoroughly, then the fight would’ve been a lot tougher.\nNormally, Seira shouldn’t have had any trouble taking down a level 7 General by herself, but at the time, she’d been affected by madness, so he didn’t know how it would have actually turned out.\n\"And as you know, the Spirit General’s on our side now.\"\n\"Hoo, hoo.\"\n\"That means that you actually defeated 7 of the 12 Generals... Moreover, you were able to defeat my brother... Seagald and the Archmage as well.\"\nShe looked like she couldn’t believe what she was saying. As humans grew, their karma became personalized to them, which causes them to have certain affinities and weaknesses.\nThe 12 Generals’ abilities varied, so even if you managed to defeat one of them, it also meant that you would likely struggle against another. But it sounded like Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t lose in a one-on-one confrontation with any one of them.\n\"...And now that I think about it, you’re actually undead, not human.\"\n\"Hey, don’t forget about the horse.\"\n\"I’m surprised that the Mercenary King, Metafel, had reached level 8. If you include him as well, then you’ve defeated three level 8 Generals, and have taken one on as your subordinate.\"\n\"I didn’t finish off Arema myself, but I guess that’s about right.\"\nMoreover, Lee Shin Woo had begun hunting the 12 Generals ever since he was level 6. Lee Shin Woo explained that he had acquired the Heaven Defying General title himself, and after explaining his achievements, the group had no choice but to acknowledge it.\nHigher level foes were stronger than you; that was a basic principle in this world. Yet, Lee Shin Woo had ignored that basic principle, so there was no title that fit him better than Heaven Defying!\n\"But I heard the Emperor appoints the 12 Generals himself? I heard the Emperor could bolster the 12 Generals’ ranks by appointing candidates.\"\n\"I believe it’s a type of darkness magic that uses the source of darkness. He forcibly bestows the title onto them, which strengthens their karma. That’s how he makes them even stronger. However, there’s a limit to this as well.\"\nSeira briefly explained how the 12 Generals were appointed (the Magic Emperor used his own magic to appoint his own 12 Generals. In other words, he couldn’t bolster the 12 Generals’ ranks as much as he wanted) and then continued onto the main topic.\n\"Normally, level 7 or level 8 individuals don’t come out of thin air. The reason the heroes here are so powerful is because they were picked based on their inherent talent. And the fact that so many of your subordinates are level 7 or higher... is something that even I cannot explain, though it likely has something to do with your ability, Lee Shin Woo.\"\n\"So? There’s no one like that in the capital?\"\n\"There should be some level 7s in the capital, but I’m absolutely sure that there aren’t any level 8s there. If they had other level 8s, then there wouldn’t have been any level 7 Generals in the first place.\"\nThat made sense. Since the 12 Generals were the Empire’s twelve strongest. Seira continued on.\n\"Those level 7s are weaker than the original 12 Generals, so even if they were to replace them, they would ultimately be much weaker than the generals you’ve killed thus far. In other words, they aren’t a threat.\"\n\"There’s a chance that the 12 General candidates grew... Ah, never mind.\"\nThe only reason Metafel Rerdan was able to grow was because he was an Elite Ghoul with the ability to eat others. That, as well as other miracles intertwined, allowing him to reach level 8, but the chance that that would happen to the others was extremely low.\n\"We only need to worry about the level 8 12 Generals. The others aren’t worth talking about, so you can just ignore them.\"\n\"I see. First, the Archmage survived...\"\n\"I’m not sure what Seagald’s position is, but I do know that at that moment, he’s not on the Emperor’s side. If that’s the case, then there’s only one person left. The last of the Empire’s Four Heavenly Commanders, the Heaven Sundering General, Leofield Von Tariman.\"\n\"Duke Tariman...\"\nDana murmured. Lee Shin Woo furrowed his brow, as he felt like he’d heard that name before... He remembered. It was from a memory fragment he gained long ago.\n\"The owner of the first memories I absorbed... In other words, a level 1 skeleton learned spearmanship from Leofield.\"\n\"That sounds right. Since he created the spearmanship that the army uses. It’s not an exaggeration to say that the entire army uses his spearmanship.\"\nTechnically, he had learned the basics of how to fight from Leofield. Lee Shin Woo grinned at the strange connection, but Dana sported a serious expression and said.\n\"But his own spearmanship is far greater than the soldiers’, Hero.\"\nWas she scared just remembering him? Dana was shaking.\n\"He specializes in mass murder and was monstrous enough to be able to overwhelm the Annihilation Flame Sword God in a one-on-one confrontation. He’s definitely human, but he’s big enough that he makes you wonder whether he has Giants’ blood mixed in his veins or not. ...And this is the most important part. He’s a complete musclehead, so you can’t reason with him. He might even be dumber than most undead.\"\n\"Dana, you only compare two things when they’re somewhat similar. That man doesn’t even have a brain. He doesn’t listen to anyone aside from the Emperor... He’s just a combat machine.\"\n\"But he’s still one of the Four Heavenly Commanders, huh.\"\n\"Since he’s extremely strong. His spearmanship, which is reinforced by his almost fully mastered wind element, can cut through anything. The other Four Heavenly Commanders avoided fighting him head-on. If I had to pick one person in the Empire who’s mastered martial arts, then I’d have to pick between Seagald Von Retadane and Leofield Von Tariman... But I’d ultimately pick Leofield.\"\n\"You must be wary of this man. He’s one of the few people that can ruin your plans with just pure strength alone.\"\nSeira and Dana were in agreement and voiced their concerns regarding the last of the Four Heavenly Commanders. However, Lee Shin Woo just shrugged his shoulders after listening to them.\n\"I feel like I’ll be able to kill him quite easily.\" The most update n0vels are published on novel{f}ire.net\n\"Avoid fighting him head-on at all costs! I know how great your combat skills and your other abilities are, but you cannot beat him in close combat, Hero! You should instead attack him from a distance; throw those exploding weapons at him. No, he might just cut through those explosions...\"\n\"I don’t think that’s the issue here... It’s fine. Just keep explaining the capital’s forces and its facilities.\"\nDana stared at Lee Shin Woo as if she were worried about him, but the other women beside her, including Seira, looked at her in displeasure, so she was forced to back off immediately.\nLee Shin Woo was more afraid of this situation than the Heaven Sundering General. But he didn’t say anything so he could make it out of this alive.",

    "content": "<Chapter 48. - Premature Family Plan - 7>\nAn hour passed, and when they were about done, Lee Shin Woo looked over the map, which he’d made with Dana and Seira’s help, and nodded his head.\n\"Mm. This looks about right.\"\n\"You’re quite good at drawing too, Hero.\"\nBecause it’d been dozens of years since Dana or Seira had last been to the capital, there was no guarantee that their knowledge was reliable. However, once he heard their explanation regarding the capital, he pretty much knew how he should move from then on.\n\"The structure’s a lot simpler than Bayran, which had traps everywhere. All we need to know is where the fortifications are, where the troops are stationed, and where the palace is... Oh. The source of darkness is beneath the palace!? Then he pretty much does leave it right next to him!\"\n\"Dana told you that already. That the source of darkness couldn’t be moved. So the Emperor just moved right next to it.\"\nHow valuable was it for him to do such a thing!?\n\"He wanted to monopolize it. Since it’s a treasure that made the underground, which was originally nothing more than a slightly large prison, into an Empire, and so... The Emperor wouldn’t have wanted it to leave his side.\"\n\"Ah, as I thought. Maintaining an Empire this size is abnormal, huh.\"\n\"Of course it is. It’d be impossible with even the surface’s magic engineering.\"\n\"So why is that source thing here?\"\nWhy exactly did such a treasure lay dormant underground? What, did they try to destroy it, but were met by a level 10 dragon or something? No, probably not. Lee Shin Woo grumbled and Dana smiled.\n\"Of course not. It’s just a huge, everlasting mass of pure energy. Some say it’s a relic left behind during the Age of Gods, before civilization even began. We cannot identify the origins of many level 7 artifacts and up. Please look at it that way.\"\n\"The dungeon’s loot does seem kind of out of place...\"\nLee Shin Woo was sure of something. The source of darkness... There was something behind it! Something that was a pain in the ass!\nHowever, there was no point in worrying about that now, so he decided to worry about it later. Getting the Emperor and the Lich away from the source of darkness took priority.\n\"The remaining problem is... Mm. We need to figure out where exactly the train will take us in the capital.\"\n\"You can just sacrifice one of your Pauls.\"\n\"Mm, that’s a bit... How about I use a golem instead.\"\nHe was reluctant to sacrifice one of the Pauls, as they’d regained a part of their human selves. Lee Shin Woo instead decided to sacrifice one of the remaining level 4 Bronze Golems in his golem squad.\n\"Alright. We’ve gone over the main issues. Let’s do it as we’ve discussed. I’ll take Senior Prince to the surface right now. ...Oh, and Dana, you come to the surface too.\"\n\"I’d like to be with you Hero, but... Ah, is this perhaps related to what you were talking about before?\"\n\"Yep.\"\nLee Shin Woo grinned, seeing Dana’s eyes gleam with excitement, and said exactly what she wanted to hear.\n\"I’ll introduce you to the spirits on the surface. You’re plenty strong already, but an Elementalist needs their spirits.\"\n\"Aaaah! Thank you so much, Hero!\"\nAs expected, it was easy to convince her when spirits were involved. The spirits of Bayran had been sacrificed over several years, and she had essentially been the one to kill them, but... perhaps that was why she wanted to meet living spirits so much.\n\"I’ll take these two to the surface and take a look around, so you guys can all just rest...\"\nLee Shin Woo stopped partway. No matter how he looked at it, it didn’t seem like they’d just stay put and rest. Everyone, including Kratia, looked at him, intent on going to the surface.\nHe supposed it only made sense. They had lived underground for so many years, so how could they not want to see the surface? But why was it that he felt that that wasn’t the only reason? And why did the back of his head sting so much?\n\"Are you guys fighting something I’m not aware of...? Are you fighting something somewhere else?\"\n\"Probably a fight over love.\"\n\"Kratia, you’re actually Korean, aren’t you?\"\nLee Shin Woo ultimately sighed and was forced to take all of them to the surface. Since they were so physically and mentally fatigued from the last battle, he was going to let them rest for a day or two anyway, so it wouldn’t be problematic to his schedule. Plus, the Heaven Door’s Key required much fewer bones and mana than before.\n\"This is...\"\n\"It really is the night sky.\"\nWith the Heaven Door’s Key, an unbelievable high rank artifact, they could easily ignore the barrier and cross over to the surface; the party arrived in a quiet forest near the capital and were speechless for a time.\nA city filled with life, as well as a natural sky with the moon and stars. No matter how much they looked, the party remained mesmerized by the abundance of life.\n\"Ah, I remember us being like this when we first got here too.\"\n\"To think we’d be able to come to the surface so easily...\"\n\"There was an artifact that could easily break through the barrier like this... My father is truly pitiful.\"\n\"Yeah. Instead of developing the undead curse, he could’ve just gone around killing Steves instead; it would’ve been a lot simpler.\"\n\"Steve?\"\n\"He’s a great guy in the neighborhood who always leaves something for me whenever I see him.\"\n\"???\"\nLee Shin Woo waited for them to calm down and then led them into the capital. Rem accessed the golem network, allowing them to use a path with no one around, so no one noticed them.\nAfter the Emperor had torched his house, the Lawrence shop and Ye Jin Jin (she was operating under the alias, Izuna on the surface) moved closer to the Sun God religion. Of course, that location was reported to Lee Shin Woo beforehand.\n\"This must be it.\"\n\"It’s quite grand...\"\n\"You normally can’t enter this part of the capital with just money... How many months did this take you to procure?\"\n\"It’s not all that great. Since we’re publicly antagonizing the Emperor.\"\nTo be more specific, he and the Emperor had opposing opinions of what was happening on the surface. Just that would draw the Emperor’s attention, but... Lee Shin Woo hoped his little trick would divert the Emperor’s attention.\n\"Mr. Shin Woo!\"\n\"It’s been a while.\"\nOnce she was quietly informed of his arrival, the front gate opened and Ye Jin Jin came bursting out.\nShe looked around, ensuring that the Emperor wasn’t watching, and then jumped into his arms, repeatedly kissing his cheek.\nYe Jin Jin was wearing the Phoenix’s Feather even when she wasn’t fighting, just like she’d been told. Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on noveⅼfire.net\n\"I’m so glad you’re safe! I missed you!\"\n\"I’m more glad that you’re safe. Good job.\"\n\"Hmmm.\"\n\"As I thought...\"\n\"Tch. How vulgar.\"\nSeeing that, his party passed judgment and looked at her maliciously. He really couldn’t take this; the mood was stifling! He pretty much knew what they were thinking, but it was precisely because he knew that that he couldn’t understand why they were reacting like this!\nLee Shin Woo thought that he’d have to somehow resolve this issue soon, but then Ye Jin Jin’s blush intensified and she dropped a bombshell.\n\"You’re going to sleep over today, right? Right?\"\n\"...Tch!\"\n\"So vulgar...!\"\n\"Oh my. Isn’t that Ms. Retadane’s voice...? And who is this extremely beautiful lady... Ah, even Senior Prince is here?\"\nOnly then did Ye Jin Jin notice his party and tilt her head. The women didn’t even introduce themselves and continuously glared at Ye Jin Jin. Lee Shin Woo sighed at the idiotic situation and then said.\n\"For now, let’s just go in. I’ll explain everything. ...Actually, there are some things that I won’t be able to explain to you.\"\n\"I suppose that’s true.\"\n\"You’re truly a sinful man, Hero. Hoo.\"\nAnd thus, his relationship with Ye Jin Jin was revealed to all. His relationship with her had also caused the mood to worsen.\nThus far, Lee Shin Woo had never formed a relationship with a woman unless it was strictly necessary, so he really wasn’t good at being considerate of other people’s feelings. He couldn’t help but acknowledge that flaw of his.\n’When you really think about it, that’s why I had that issue with Jin.’\nHe hadn’t matured at all. Lee Shin Woo made small talk, but the mood didn’t improve; he clicked his tongue and thought about it. His only ally in this situation, Prince, just patted his shoulder.\n\"I guess you’re in the same ship as Lloyd. I’m just glad you’ve finally noticed.\"\n\"That feels really humiliating. Aren’t they in the wrong, not me?\"\nHe’d only known Dana for a day, and it wouldn’t surprise him if Seira hated him as if he were her worst enemy. Lee Shin Woo couldn’t understand these two at all, the two responsible for the current atmosphere.\nHowever, Prince just laughed at him, which frustrated him to no end, and dismissed him.\n\"Life’s not rational, Junior.\"\n\"Damn it. How could you of all people say something like that...\"\n\"Hey, what did you just say?\"\nThis idiot senior said something wise, which only further pissed him off! Prince then gave some more advice to the grumbling Lee Shin Woo.\n\"Why don’t you just marry all of them? You can just propose to them after the battle’s over!\"\n\"Could you please not say something so ominous? I’m not planning on starting a family yet.\"\nLee Shin Woo immediately shot her down. He saw the women fighting amongst each other with their words, and just sighed and said.\n\"Jin Jin, how’s the religious order nowadays?\"\n\"Pardon? Ah, the religious order!?\"\nHe couldn’t let them fight any longer when there were more important matters at hand. Ye Jin Jin noticed this immediately, as she looked at him and said.\n\"They’re fighting well! Mr. Shin Woo... or the Hero Kay’s death caused the factions that oppose the Emperor’s rule to increase in strength. And they’re constantly finding traces of the undead or death energy doing significant damage to the Empire, so... The Sun God religion, which is at the forefront, is getting a lot of support!\"\n\"What about you?\"\nHis question embarrassed Ye Jin Jin a bit.\n\"I got a bit famous since we went with the concept of a female knight enraged over her lover’s death. No... I might’ve gotten more famous than the Hero Kay.\"\n\"Good. That’s what successful marketing is all about. What about Bisher Moon?\"\n\"He’s still fighting against the Vampires. Sometimes I help out, but there’s only so much I can do at night.\"\n\"Hmm... An opportunity will present itself soon enough.\"\n\"An opportunity?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nThe Emperor said he’d send reinforcements. Who would he send? He’d obviously send undead who could freely traverse through the Underground Empire. If that’s the case, he would definitely send the Vampires from the Red Moon.\nThey were reinforcements to fight Seagald. The reinforcements should be substantial, and if so many forces were sent underground, then it would make it easier for Bisher Moon.\nBut that wouldn’t solve the fundamental problem. The enemy on the surface, and the enemy underground. He needed an opportunity to kill both of them. And that opportunity...\n\"If I can kill some of the 12 Generals, then the stage will be set...\"\n\"What’re you planning?\"\n\"What else would a performer be thinking about besides his stage?\"\nFollowing Lee Shin Woo’s reunion with Ye Jin Jin, Jin looked at him more sharply than before and retorted. Lee Shin Woo just shrugged his shoulders, replied, and turned around. He was done assessing the situation. There was only one thing left to do.\n\"Dana, enough with the nonsense and follow me. I’ll introduce you to the spirits.\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 49. Arranging the Stage - 1>\nLee Shin Woo let the others rest (unlike before, the women complied, but considering the fact that Ye Jin Jin was shooting some kind of ’SOS’ signal, something must’ve gone down) and went to the Spirits’ Spring with Dana. They were able to arrive quickly with the use of the Heaven Door’s Key.\n\"T-This is...\"\n\"This is the Spirits’ Spring. The real Spirits’ Spring.\"\n\"The Spirits’ Spring... I see, this truly is...\"\nThe moment they entered, Dana realized that this was what she’d been looking for. The Undead Emperor had tricked her into thinking that they were creating a paradise for the spirits, a place where they could relax and put them at ease. But this was the true Spirits’ Spring! To think it existed on the surface!\n[Ah, the Contractor has arrived.]\n[It’s been a while, Contractor. You’ve gotten even stronger. I’m always ready to fight.]\n[Someone tell her that he’s here. The person she’s been waiting for has come.]\nThe spirits of the Spirits’ Spring greeted him somewhat differently from the Dryads in the wine factory. The Dryads treated him as if he were their lover, their husband, or their father, but these spirits treated Lee Shin Woo as if he were their boss.\n\"Contractor...? You’re contracted with this many spirits? Now that I think about it, I feel a faint connection between you and these spirits.\"\nDana quickly noticed. How could he have formed a contract with several thousand spirits? She looked on in disbelief, but as she observed the spirits, she realized something even more astounding.\n\"No, wait. That’s not it. Hero, did you form a contract with this entire space...?\"\n\"You (an Elementalist) catch on quick. You’re right. I’ve formed a contract with this space, the Spirits’ Spring itself to be exact. It’s less effective than forming a contract individually with each and every spirit, but... it’s still a win-win.\"\n\"To think... that that was possible.\"\nShe knew that Lee Shin Woo had done some amazing things, but of those achievements, this was the most surprising. Of course, she was already surprised about the fact that the Spirits’ Spring even existed in the first place. But then...\n[Huh? That girl is...]\n[In terms of being an Elementalist, she’s better than the Contractor!?]\n[Who exactly did the Contractor bring? Oh my god!]\nThe spirits trickled in, one or two at a time, to greet Lee Shin Woo, but soon realized how skilled his companion was and were shocked. It was only natural. After all, she was the Underground Empire’s greatest Elementalist.\nLee Shin Woo was highly skilled in forming contracts rather than being an Elementalist, while Dana’s ability to draw spirits to her was unmatched.\nThe Emperor had bedded the most powerful of the exiled Elementalists, creating Dana in the process. She was born with high magic and a strong affinity with spirits! It was only natural that she would be loved by spirits. Moreover, by transforming her into an Immortal, she had gained the ability to use the darkness element. This allowed her to more easily form contracts with spirits.\n\"It’s nice to meet you, everyone. My name is Dana.\"\n[A peculiar energy. She’s not human, but something else. She’s like us spirits.]\n[The contractor did something to her. If that’s the case, then she is like us.]\n[Come in, friend of the spirits. We’ll take you inside.]\nThe spirits immediately swarmed Dana. Dana didn’t know what to do and looked at Lee Shin Woo. He looked at her kindly and nodded his head.\n\"Go ahead and follow them. Since that was my intention from the very beginning.\"\n\"Hero...! I understand. Then, please excuse me for a bit!\"\nDana bowed at Lee Shin Woo while looking overjoyed and went inside the cave with the spirits. Once he’d given her away to the spirits, the Elder Dryad Princess Sinea appeared behind him and hugged him. It felt like she was hugging him tighter than normal; maybe he was imagining things.\n[Paul Zero, who’s that pretty lady? I smell your scent on her.]\n\"Sinea, not you too. I’m getting tired of it.\"\n[S-Sorry. That wasn’t my intention... Are you tired? Come here, I’ll give you a lap pillow.]\nWhile Dana was enjoying herself with the spirits, Lee Shin Woo rested on Sinea’s lap. Her soft and refreshing scent really made him want to unwind and just keep resting.\nOf course, he didn’t come here just to rest. He was able to assess the state of the spirits here through Sinea, who had taken over command of the Spirits’ Spring as Zenon was still outside travelling with Ye Jin Jin. And he also briefly explained his plans from now on.\n[Will it go well? They’re really strong.]\n\"If the stage is set properly. I’m preparing just in case that doesn’t go well, so don’t worry. All you need to do is do your best.\"\n[I’m ready to whatever you need me to do, Paul Zero. I’m just... worried about you.]\n\"That’s why I’m preparing so much. And...\"\nLee Shin Woo pointed at Dana, who was chatting and laughing along with the spirits.\n\"She’s a good person. I’m not good enough to command the spirits of the Spirits’ Spring, but Dana should be able to draw more power from them than normal.\"\n[Are you going to make her form a contract with the spring?]\n\"Yeah.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s contract with the Spirits’ Spring was very irregular. However, something that happened once could happen again. Thus, Lee Shin Woo would personally connect Dana, the princess who was universally beloved by spirits, and the Spirits’ Spring together, allowing her to control the power of the spirits here.\nHe had enough on his plate already, so it wasn’t a good idea for him to command the spirits as well. So Dana’s timing couldn’t be better, as she had a strong affinity with spirits.\n[It can’t be helped, I suppose. She seems capable of commanding the Spirits’ Spring too...]\n\"If we add her power into the mix, then the spirits should no longer have to fear the undead curse. Since that’s the base of her species.\"\n[Paul Zero, you did something incredible somewhere else again, didn’t you?]\n\"Mm. I’ll start telling you now.\"\n[Oh my. Hoo, hoo.]\nLee Shin Woo noticed that Dana wouldn’t be free of the spirits for a while, so he drew Sinea towards him. She obviously didn’t resist. That sweet repose lasted another hour.\n\"Will I... really be able to do it?\"\n\"Think of it in more simple terms. I’ve already formed a contract with the Spirits’ Spring, and I’ve formed a contract with you as well. It’ll be easy to form a contract between you two.\"\n\"I’ll form a contract with the Spirits’ Spring... Me...\"\nAfter he’d explained everything to her, Dana looked around the Spirits’ Spring with bright eyes. He thought she would jump at the opportunity, but she seemed more deeply moved than he’d expected. It felt like she could survive off spirits, rather than three meals a day.\n\"I see. So I will command this place together with you, Hero...\"\n[I’m here too. Take care of me, Dana.]\n\"Keuk...\"\nDana briefly glared at Sinea, who was still clinging onto Lee Shin Woo, but she still couldn’t give up the opportunity that Lee Shin Woo was giving her. On the contrary...\n\"Alright. I’ll be in your care!\"\n\"Ah, she’s acting strange too. Why am I surrounded by weirdos?\"\nShe’d already made up her mind, so no matter how many rivals she had, she wouldn’t lose! Dana shook Sinea’s outstretched hand. At that moment, the Spirits’ Spring reacted to her and began to brighten. The spirits within the Spirits’ Spring did the same.\n[The Spirits’ Spring is growing!]\n[Aah. Aaaaah.]\n[She’s a descendant of one of the exiled Elementalists!]\n[We need to embrace her.]\n[We’re so thankful that she came to lead us.]\n[The Spirits’ Spring is so happy. The traces of the past contractors within her are resonating with us.]\nIn a way, they were a lot happier than when Lee Shin Woo had formed a contract with them... He watched on unhappily; the light intensified and was eventually absorbed by Dana.\nShe began to open her eyes slowly. Her golden eyes showed more life in them than before; radiating with various elements and magic.\n\"It’s been a long time since I’ve felt like this. I didn’t think a day like this would come... It’s all because of you, Hero. You so easily gave me back everything that I’d lost.\"\n\"It’s a coincidence. My ability was just good.\"\n\"Hero...\"\nLee Shin Woo answered brusquely and realized that perhaps this was the core reason as to why she liked him so much. If she were alone, he would’ve accepted her without hesitation...\n’Well, that’s that. Since it’s best if I leave her like this for now.’\nHe knew that human emotion could yield immeasurable power. Of course, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t going to just leave them (the women) like this.\nHe couldn’t understand why they liked him so much, but since they did, he could stimulate those emotions and use them to help them survive and kill the Magic and Undead Emperors.\nIn the process, he’d have to go through the trouble of taking care of any improper emotions, but he could deal with that later so long as they could make it through the battle. That was Lee Shin Woo’s true intentions.\n\"...Huh? Ah.\"\nLee Shin Woo had such a Joker-esque thought, but soon realized that Dana and all the spirits were staring at him. Sinea had probably explained his plans to them. He nodded his head and said.\n\"The time for your revenge is nigh. Did you hear? The spirits underground were sacrificed in vain. You have no allies underground nor on the surface. Ultimately, you have to save yourselves. It’s almost time. ...You must create a place where you can live with your descendants yourselves. Can you do it?\"\n[Of course.]\n[I’ve been waiting for you to say that.]\n[I’ll cultivate a place like this, so that spirits like us can live peacefully, even if I have to risk my own life to do so!]\n\"Good. Then break it up. Prepare yourselves.\"\nAfter he’d formed a contract between Dana and the Spirits’ Spring, Lee Shin Woo parted ways with Sinea, who was weeping and clinging onto him, and returned to his house. The ragged Ye Jin Jin and the other angry women greeted him. Get full chapters from Novᴇl_Fire(.)net\n\"Did you guys fight?\"\n\"We just drank some tea. ...Would you like some too?\"\n\"It’s not some radioactive tea or something, is it...?\"\n\"Heuk, heuk. Mr. Shin Woo.\" [1]\nIt was such a relief that Sinea wasn’t here too. Ye Jin Jin hugged him and he began comforting her; this situation was ridiculous.\nIf he slept with her that anger of theirs would probably spread to him as well, but... he couldn’t leave a customer unhappy. Plus, he’d have to increase her burden in the future.\n\"Then, rest up. I have something else I have to talk to Ye Jin Jin about.\"\n\"Something to talk about? Are you really just going to talk?\"\n\"No, I’m going to do other stuff too.\"\n\"Keuk...!\"\n\"This is why men are...!\"\n\"A bad man. So cool.\"\nThat night, Lee Shin Woo explained what would happen soon, as well as what she would have to do on the surface.\nNot only had she risen to level 7, she’d also grown immensely in such a short time, so she was definitely qualified to handle things here.\nYe Jin Jin couldn’t readily believe what he was saying, but she ultimately nodded her head. The edge of the javelin he’d given her was still sharp.\n\"Junior, I’ll do my best here! I really like the Sun God religion!\"\n\"It’s great that you like them and all, but please be wary of the pope. After all, he covets talented people.\"\nPrince impersonated a priest of the Sun God religion, and Dana temporarily stayed in the Spirits’ Spring to get familiar with the spirits there. Now, he was done with everything he needed to do here.\nThe next day, the party did some light shopping and then returned underground.\n[1] T/N: Heuk, heuk is equivalent to ’boo hoo’ or sobbing.",

    "content": "<Chapter 49. Arranging the Stage - 2>\n\"It’s tough.\"\n\"Did you ever think it’d be easy?\"\nLee Shin Woo and Kratia returned to the Underground Empire and immediately went to work on improving the Huginn’s Eye. Although Kratia had found the documents, which acted as the catalyst, when they actually tried to actually apply that information, they encountered several problems.\n\"If we fail, the artifact’s done for. The difficulty’s too high.\"\n\"Even if this one breaks, there might be another one out there, right?\"\n\"Do you want me to break it?\"\n\"No, my bad.\"\nThe magical engineering theory that Kratia had proposed was much too difficult for Lee Shin Woo to understand.\nHe’d managed to recreate the Steelworker seal and created never before seen artifacts in the past, so it wouldn’t be strange if he were to receive the ’Magic Engineer’ title. However, that was all brought about by his intuition, as well as his mana sense. He specialized in practical application rather than theory.\n\"That mana sense is important. If I do something wrong, then you should be able to fix it, Shin Woo.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah. I already know you need me. Let’s finish up. We need to kill those Liches, but finding Seagald takes precedence.\"\nHe’d given the rest of his party jobs to do while he and Kratia were improving the Huginn’s Eye. Seira, who had accepted her status as an undead Banshee, was getting used to her Banshee abilities, as well as the darkness element she’d inherited from Lee Shin Woo.\nWhereas Jin had only one job to do regardless of whether she’d gotten to level 8 or acquired the light element, and that was running. Of course, it wasn’t just running. She would run using every skill and ability she had. She just ran and ran, like a madwoman. She just kept running, even though it seemed like she may not be able to run any faster.\nAt their levels, rather than focusing on hunting a monster or two, it was much more effective to get used to their own abilities.\n\"Alright. I think it’s possible. No, it’ll definitely work.\"\nAnd thus, three days passed. Kratia’s eyes shined on the dawn of the fourth day. She and Lee Shin Woo had formed and discarded over thirty hypotheses, but at the end of that all, she said...\n\"If we can imitate the target’s mana, then we can find them. We can make it like that.\"\n\"Ah, you got that from the golems’ basic abilities.\"\n\"It was hard to adapt it to the Huginn’s Eye. But it’ll work now. Let’s begin.\"\nKratia had mapped out the design but improving it was actually Lee Shin Woo’s job. He was able to modify the Huginn’s Eye with his Disguise and Wild Card skills, as well as his darkness element. Soon, Kratia stretched her hand towards Lee Shin Woo, but he stopped her.\n\"Wait a sec. Let’s set-up up some insurance first.\"\nBy ’insurance’, he meant Dark Shadow. Even if they messed up the adjustment, with Dark Shadow’s ability to reverse cause-and-effect, they would be able to return it to its original state.\n\"That’s the time element!\"\n\"What are you talking about? It’s different. It’s merely changing a ’damaged state’ to an ’undamaged state’.\"\n\"I can’t understand what you’re saying. What’s an innate element? And what’s a fusion element? It goes beyond all logic...!\"\nOnly a small handful of people had ever attained innate elements, so it was only natural that Kratia couldn’t comprehend them.\nLee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and used Dark Shadow to ensure that he had ’saved’ the image of the undamaged Huginn’s Eye. With this, he reduced any delay in the reversal as much as possible, and he could reverse any mistake as soon as he detected it. This had only become possible because the Dark Shadow element had leveled up to the intermediate level.\n\"Then, let’s start for real. We probably won’t have to use our insurance.\"\n\"I trust you.\"\nLee Shin Woo and Kratia grabbed each other’s hand. He established a connection with her using the darkness element, causing the image in her head to clearly show in his eyes. The connection was secure. Lee Shin Woo now understood the image and grabbed the Huginn’s Eye with his free hand.\n’...Shall we begin?’\nIt felt like he’d become a surgeon in the operating room, as the sharply refined mana burst forth and Wild Card’s influence intensified.\nHe began modifying the artifact. He’d practiced a few times already, so the image relayed from Kratia was incredibly clear, and her thoughts were also indirectly relayed. Thus, it made it easier for him to modify the artifact.\n’Good. There are no problems.’\nEverything went so smoothly that he actually felt worried. Moreover, his mana sense had instinctively found the right path, and so he began to infuse his mana into the Huginn’s Eye.\nThe route was a bit different from what Kratia had first suggested. Kratia was briefly startled but soon created a new magic formula on the spot. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and continued to infuse his mana into it. And so, the artifact evolved. Newest update provıded by novel fire.net\n\"...\"\n\"...!\"\nThey couldn’t say a thing, but their emotions ran wild at each and every moment. If the mana lost its place, then the artifact would explode. If he responded a second too late, then the level 8 artifact would crumble into nothingness.\n\"Heut...\"\nBut it would be fine now. He could feel it. This was Lee Shin Woo’s intuition talking. He was creating a new artifact that would find whomever he wanted, and pursue every trace of mana that existed within this world.\nThe Archmage had exhausted every means available to him to create this supreme artifact, but with the collaboration of two, young geniuses, the Huginn’s Eye was reaching a realm even beyond that. The Archmage would probably have no idea that this item would eventually become the noose around his neck.\n’An artifact that can categorize mana, can divide the strands into more detail, can affect a large area, and can pick out a specific target... Something that can pick up information from anywhere that’s affected by mana, like Odin’s raven...!\nAt some point, the current of mana being infused ceased. Lee Shin Woo took a deep breath and carefully placed it on the table. As if waiting for him to place it down, light surged from the artifact, and it began to suck in the atmospheric mana like a vacuum!\n\"We succeeded...!\"\n\"Yeah. The artifact’s crazily sucking in the surrounding mana, which means...\"\nKratia said silently, and Lee Shin Woo likewise lowered his voice. Kratia didn’t show her emotions often (though she tended to show them quite often nowadays), but looked quite happy and gripped Lee Shin Woo’s hand tightly while still being connected.\n[The Lv8 Huginn’s Eye has acquired suitable karma and is evolving.]\n[You have acquired the Lv9 Mana Radar.]\n\"...\"\n\"...Shin Woo?\"\n\"No, it’s nothing.\"\nLee Shin Woo picked up the new level 9 artifact and felt dissatisfied. It had such a cool name before, so why did it change into such an intuitive one!?\nOf course, this was all Lee Shin Woo’s fault. As the one that modified the item, Lee Shin Woo’s thoughts had caused an extreme change in the artifact, causing it to become a reflection of his subconscious will. Lee Shin Woo didn’t know what to think. He stared at the Mana Radar but ultimately grabbed it.\nAnd was shocked.\n\"This is more amazing than my wildest imagination...\"\nFirst, it’s search range. It had a huge range when it was a level 8 artifact, but now that it’d leveled up its range could cover the entire Underground Empire.\nThat quality was enough to prove that it was a level 9 artifact, but what was even more shocking was its primary function! By categorizing the target and subdividing them, the user could figure out everything there was to know about a target they’d met once or someone who had a deep connection to mana.\n\"This can find anything. There’s nothing it can’t find. What’s worse, even if it’s an artifact...\"\n\"Yeah. It really is amazing. The result of adding our power to the surface and underground’s magic engineering.\"\nThey had, unbeknownst to the Magic or Undead Emperors, combined the surface and underground’s techniques to create such a divine artifact. Would they ever become aware of this fact!? Though the two had become easier to kill because of that!\n[You have created a level 9 artifact with the help of a talented comrade. Though it was originally a level 8 artifact, you fused together the knowledge of several worlds and civilizations in order to develop it one step further. These techniques are so impressive that it is difficult to appraise them.]\n[You have acquired the title ’God’s Hand’. All stats have increased by 50. The chance that you create a high-quality item increases.]\nHe’d been expecting a message like this. Kratia was rewarded as well this time. The two briefly enjoyed the status bonuses. But the most welcoming news was that his recently acquired title would make the rest of his tasks easier!\n\"Then, Shin Woo. Let’s move on to the next thing. A Titan equipped with the Demon Heart. I’m really excited.\"\n\"There’s something I need to do before that. Wait just a little bit.\"\n\"...Tch.\"\nLee Shin Woo entered Seagald’s mana into the Mana Radar. If it were anyone else, they probably wouldn’t have understood Seagald’s Annihilation Flame, even if they experienced it first hand.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo already had three innate elements, and had temporarily stolen the Annihilation Flame with his Dark Flame! Perfectly imitating Seagald’s mana pattern wasn’t impossible for him!\n\"...But why is it acting like this?\"\n\"What’s wrong, Shin Woo?\"\n\"It’s just that there’s no way he’s here.\"\nLee Shin Woo couldn’t believe his eyes and shook the level 9 Mana Radar around. In Korea, he’d learned to hit things when they didn’t work to get them working again, but he suppressed that urge, as he didn’t want to damage such a precious artifact.\nIt wasn’t a level 9 artifact for nothing; no matter how many times he tried the search, the result was the same. So long as there wasn’t a fundamental issue with the artifact itself, there was no way the information would be wrong.\n\"Do you know where this is?\"\n\"Just a minute. I’m not familiar with these coordinates. Let me look through your memories... Yeah, I know where it is.\"\nSoon, Kratia understood why he was reacting like that and sported a peculiar expression. Who else could understand the absurdity of this all besides her?\n\"This bastard. He really is on the surface...\"\n\"Now I know why he was never caught...\"\nThat’s right. He didn’t know how long he’d been there, but the Anti-Skull’s leader... Seagald Von Retadane was on the surface.",

    "content": "<Chapter 49. Arranging the Stage - 3>\n\"Shin Woo, didn’t you say that the Magic Emperor oversees the golem network? So then how did Seagald get up there undetected?\"\n\"Seagald has his Annihilation Flame. Maybe he used that to mess with the golem network.\"\n\"Is that even possible?\"\n\"Innate elements make it possible. In laymen’s terms, they’re like Haki in One Piece. In the first half, the characters fought with their Devil Fruit and their abilities, but in the latter half, they added Haki, which completely ruined the power balance.\"\n\"I’m not sure I understand, but I get that it’s a cheat.\"\nThere was also a high chance that he used Annihilation Flame to pass through the barrier. The barrier, which doesn’t allow any living being to pass through it, wasn’t just some conceptual barrier, but also acted as a physical and magical barricade.\nIf the barrier was destroyed, then the Emperor would surely know. So the fact that the Emperor didn’t know that Seagald was here meant that he’d used his Annihilation Flame to erase his and his subordinates’ presences to pass through the barrier undetected. It really was an overpowered ability.\n\"I can’t understand it logically.\"\n\"It’s not a power that makes logical sense.\"\nComparing innate elements and determining which one was better was laughable, but Lee Shin Woo really felt that the Annihilation Flame was incredibly powerful. Seagald’s Annihilation Flame was more powerful than the Emperor’s Lightning Bind.\nMost importantly was the fact that the Emperor wasn’t always using his Lightning Bind to control the golem network. If that’s the case, then it would be stranger if Seagald had been found.\n\"It’s possible. He might already be forming a bridgehead to invade the surface.\"\n\"Like what you did by acting like a hero and hiding the fact that you were undead, Shin Woo?\"\n\"No, there wasn’t anyone suspicious in the Empire besides me. No matter how amazing the Annihilation Flame is, it wouldn’t allow him to act perfectly like me. He, as well as his subordinates, wouldn’t have been able to hide in plain sight.\"\n\"Then?\"\n...He’s probably in a dungeon. The citizens of the Empire resented the Empire for neglecting the dungeons that endangered them. It’s entirely possible that Seagald had found an abandoned dungeon and transformed it into his base.\nNo. If the surface’s sewers had been converted into secret facilities like the underground’s, then there was a chance that he could even be in the capital at this very moment...\n\"Ha. What a vicious bastard. To think he was already preparing himself for an invasion of the surface.\"\n\"Shin Woo, you’re smiling.\"\n\"I can’t help it.\"\nBy learning of Seagald’s plan beforehand, he would be able to turn things in his favor! Kratia watched him and gave a silent prayer.\n\"Annihilation Flame Sword god... It was truly the perfect plan. It’s unfortunate you had to meet Shin Woo.\"\n\"All plans look perfect until you figure them out.\"\nLee Shin Woo recorded Seagald’s location and reported it to the Emperor through the communication device. Once he did so, the Emperor was furious beyond belief.\n[The surface!? You’re saying that that lowly undead fooled me!? How dare he trick me!?]\n[I’m 100% certain. He’s confusing us by quickly moving between the surface and the underground. That’s why my report was late; I had no idea that he could return to the surface...!]\n[Grr...]\nLee Shin Woo could hear the Emperor grinding his teeth. The angrier he got, the easier it became for Lee Shin Woo to trick him, so there was nothing better for him.\n[I got it. Arema, you did well; you brought this to my attention before it was too late and I won’t forget it. Now that I know he’s here, there’s no one that can stop me from punishing him!]\n[It’s an honor, Your Majesty.]\n[Some of his forces must still be underground. That works in our favor. A few of the 12 Generals have finished their training, so finish off the rest of Anti-Skull with their help. We can’t let them provoke Jissehanu no matter what. Don’t let them even think about coming to the surface. Do you understand?]\n[I understand, Your Majesty.]\nMm. As he thought, the Magic Emperor was indeed afraid of the Undead Emperor, Jissehanu. It was only natural; Jissehanu had studied magic like a madman for hundreds of years all in order to take his revenge and was also level 9. If the Magic Emperor was truly afraid, then... Lee Shin Woo thought about it, but first bowed his head deeply before the Emperor.\n[As you wish, Your Majesty.]\n[They’ll arrive shortly. Don’t let any of them get away.]\n[Of course, Your Majesty.]\nThe line went dead. Lee Shin Woo left the room and released the Arema disguise, sporting an even larger smile than before.\n\"Soon...\"\n\"Soon what?\"\n\"Jeez, you surprised me!\"\nJust a second ago, there was definitely nothing there, but Jin suddenly appeared before him, raking the air with her hooves! Lee Shin Woo took a step back in shock and Jin spoke boastingly.\n\"No matter how good your perception range is, or how fast your reflexes are, it’s impossible for you to react when someone instantly closes the distance from outside of that range, right?\"\n\"I’m more surprised about how nonchalant you are about doing it.\"\n\"I almost have a full grasp on my speed. Now all that’s left is you getting on and getting used to it too.\"\nNo, wait. He couldn’t keep up with her speed, yes, but Wild Card was always active and had a huge range, so if she were able to fool even him, then... In a way, she had done something even more surprising than the likes of innate elements like Annihilation Flame or Shining Flame. Lee Shin Woo gazed at Jin, who snorted boastfully and looked at him doubtfully.\nIt didn’t happen nowadays, but looking at her now, so confident, reminded him of the time when he’d had to get used to her speed.\n\"...Do I really have to?\"\n\"It’s ok. Lately, the Assimilation skill hasn’t been gaining much proficiency. It’ll work out as long as we level it up some more.\"\n\"Assimilation, huh... That’d be nice, but I have a lot on my plate right now.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s Assimilation skill was already high rank level 7. It could only level up three more times; would he really be able to handle her speed with just that? Actually, would he even be able to level it up? Lee Shin Woo looked really disinclined and Jin retorted with a sullen voice.\n\"Seagald was kicking your ass in CQC last time.\"\n\"Ugh.\"\n\"I fought against him with Arema, but I didn’t even land a single hit. I just attacked.\"\n\"Ugh.\"\nAlthough Lee Shin Woo’s combat senses were far greater than Jin’s, their Agility stats were ultimately different. If their Assimilation was perfect, like Jin said, then Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t have been pushed back. They would be able to face off against Seagald in close quarters combat.\n\"Your combat techniques are inherently powerful too. You put in a lot of effort and were rewarded for it. But now you’re giving up on a head-to-head fight just because you lost? If that’s not what you’re doing, wouldn’t it make sense to humiliate him back?\" ᴛhis chapter is ᴜpdated by novel·fire.net\n\"Y-Yeah. I think so too.\"\n\"Then, start training with me for at least three hours a day. Since it’d be more efficient to train with me than for you to try improving your reaction speed.\"\n\"...Yes ma’am, I understand.\"\nThere were no holes in her argument! Lee Shin Woo was forced to lower his head at his partner’s lecture, and Jin forgave him whilst sporting a serious expression.\nJin was happy that she’d get three hours alone with him every day from now on, but Lee Shin Woo wasn’t astute enough to notice. He was just thinking about how to level up his Assimilation skill as quickly as possible and then went back to Kratia.\n\"Lord Arema Steelworker. It’s an honor to finally meet you.\"\n\"To think I’d have a chance to meet the star of the surface... I’m grateful to His Majesty for the opportunity.\"\n[Hmm.]\nThree days had passed since then. By then, a force of three hundred strong had been sent down from the surface. It was an elite force, consisting mostly of level 6s with two level 7s and even a level 8! He could tell that the Emperor had planned for this.\nBut there was something even more surprising than that.\n[Lv8 Steel Armor General Horain Von Bateks - Elder Vampire]\n[Lv7 Wind Demon General Melloto Von Medain - Vampire]\n[Lv7 Conviction General Kisera Von Vulture - Vampire]\nThese guys... They’re not only members of the 12 Generals, but also Vampires! Moreover, all of the levels 6s were Vampires as well!\nSo this is what the Emperor meant by ’training’? Lee Shin Woo was absolutely speechless. He supposed sending undead would make it much easier to pass through the barrier!\n’I have to assume that they’re connected to the Emperor through his Lightning Bind.’\nThe innate element that resulted from the fusion between the lightning and darkness element: Lightning Bind. It would force a connection between two people and was a fearsome innate element that allowed the Emperor to do certain things. But it wasn’t as simple as it sounded; the Emperor couldn’t just link himself to just anyone.\nAs proof of this, there had been no link between Arema’s golem body and the Emperor. But the people here must have been turned into Vampires by the Emperor himself, so there was a chance that they were connected to him.\n’There’s no way the Emperor’s suspicious of me. But there’s a chance he wanted to see the underground himself.’\nIf that’s the case, then he wouldn’t be able to make them his subordinates through Instigate. If so, then what was the best way to get rid of them? He’d already made his decision. Lee Shin Woo inwardly smiled refreshingly and said.\n[I already know where their base is. Let’s get going immediately.]\n\"U-Understood. You’re not taking your time, I see.\"\n[I just can’t tolerate the sight of those insects any longer.]\nHe’d prepared for situations like this. His golem squad, which had been on standby outside, appeared. Once he was finished creating the Mana Radar, he focused on manufacturing golems. He managed to create more than 200 level 6 golems, and integrated some better materials into one of them, creating a level 7 elite golem as well!\n\"I apologize for asking now, but where are the Four Heavenly Commanders...?\"\n[...I’m going to ask Anti-Skull about them myself... Do you have a problem with that?]\n\"N-No!\"\nLee Shin Woo’s voice was tinged with anger, causing the Vampires to flinch and become speechless; they hadn’t known that Anti-Skull had killed the Four Heavenly Commanders. The level 8 Steel Armor General was the only one able to endure the pressure, and Horain Von Bateks asked carefully.\n\"Lord Arema. Have you found all of their bases?\"\n[Of course. There’re five of them.]\nThe Mana Radar had obviously not only picked up Seagald’s location but the location of the underground Anti-Skull bases as well. They broke up their forces, befitting a group that acted in the shadows, but it didn’t matter. Lee Shin Woo had figured out where all of them were.\n\"Five bases... May I ask where they are?\"\n[Four of the five are nothing special. We just need to go there and destroy them.]\nTo be honest, Anti-Skull only had four bases underground.\n[But destroying the last one will prove difficult.]\n\"Y-You’re not saying...\"\nHorain, who was quick on the uptake, immediately realized what he was saying and gulped. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and declared.\n[They’re building their forces within the capital. We have to kill them before they join forces with Jissehanu.]\nToo bad there wasn’t actually anything like that in the capital!",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 49 part4",
    "content": "<Chapter 49. Arranging the Stage - 4>\nFirst, Lee Shin Woo split up the Vampires into three groups and sent them off to three different Anti-Skull bases. He stated that he’d go to the last remaining base, but he was actually planning to send to the Pauls to take care of it.\n[Three days. In three days, we’ll regroup here and then... go to the capital.]\n\"B-But Lord Arema, what about the thorn wall...\"\n[Hoo. You’ll see when we get there. ...Prepare yourself for death. For the Emperor!]\n\"F-For the Emperor!\"\nAnd so, Lee Shin Woo expertly fooled them and sent them away. After that, he cemented his alibi. To be exact, he planned on sneaking into the capital alone as Arema and then barely coming out alive.\n\"Shin Woo, are you really going to go to the capital?\"\n\"Think about it. This is a good opportunity for me to take a look around the capital without them suspecting that it was the Heaven Defying General or the heroes.\"\nBecause he’d taken out Arema last, the palace didn’t know what had happened to the Metal God General and his forces.\nHe would cause chaos as Arema Steelworker and paint a target on the Vampires’ backs; then, he’d take what he came for and leave.\n\"I need to find out exactly where the train leads (in the capital) and see how it performs; and if I can, I’d like to go into the inner depths of the capital.\"\n\"But do you really have to take such a big risk? Can’t you just take out the Vampires after you kill Seagald and his forces?\"\n\"I may still be able to use the Emperor. But if I was the one to take them out, then the Emperor would know that I’m not the real Arema Steelworker through his Lightning Bind. I want to avoid that. If at all possible, I want the Vampires to fight someone else and die. Well, if it doesn’t work out, I can always call the Pauls and make it look like an accident.\"\nWhy wasn’t he discarding the Emperor at this point in time? Jin couldn’t understand why, so she just waited for Lee Shin Woo to continue. Lee Shin Woo grinned and went on to the crux of the matter.\n\"Moreover... It’d be nice if the Emperor kills Seagald, but if he doesn’t, then what happens? When I think about that, I feel like I have to take matters into my own hands.\"\n\"Oh, come on. He’s level 9; you really think he’d lose track of him?\"\n\"Sure, he’s level 9, but all this time, he hadn’t even noticed that Seagald was on the surface. Even I missed him once. Can he not use his full power unless he takes matters into his own hands?\"\nLee Shin Woo spoke boldly, but he’d actually encountered the Emperor once before and even escaped unscathed, so he wasn’t talking out of his ass. To be brutally honest, he felt like the Lightning Bind element was kind of a wishy-washy ability!\n\"Lightning Bind. An ability that forcefully creates a link between you and another. It allows him to bind his enemies, coerce his subordinates, or even allow him to transfer his consciousness to another, allowing him to see from afar... In many ways, it’s a good ability, but there’s one problem with it: it doesn’t have any inherent combat power.\"\n\"But it seems strong enough to me.\"\n\"If you compare it to Seagald’s Annihilation Flame or my Dark Shadow, then it’s undoubtedly weaker in a pure combat sense. Should I say that it’s unsuited for battle, or that it’s disadvantageous in a real battle?\"\nHe had a sudden thought. Perhaps the Emperor had obtained Lightning Bind because he wanted to control the Empire safely from the shadows. Though there weren’t many cases of this, innate elements were largely influenced by one’s karma.\nHe had not only exiled both the powerful 2nd prince and the Elementalists underground, but he laid traps in the capital, which were activated by his mana. Plus, he never acted on his own and just commanded his troops to act in his place... He couldn’t help but think that the Magic Emperor was nothing more than a coward!\n\"Still, didn’t you say that he’s the one who created the barrier? Now he knows, there’s no way that he’ll lose Seagald.\"\n\"I’m just preparing for the ’what if’. Let’s think about what happens if the Emperor loses Seagald. Then what’ll Seagald do?\"\n\"If I were Seagald, then I’d hide. Isn’t it the basics of the basics to regroup when you’re at a disadvantage?\"\nLee Shin Woo firmly shook his head at Jin’s remark.\n\"When something goes wrong, you have two options: to ’regroup’ or to ’push forward’. Seagald will probably pick the latter this time since the former requires time.\"\nOne can only afford to relax and take care of themselves in a battle if they’re willing to sacrifice time. But...\n\"Think about it. The surface’s Magic Emperor is gunning for him, and the Heaven Defying General is waiting for him underground. Let’s assume that Seagald’s goal is to turn the Undead Emperor, Jissehanu into Anti-Skull and invade the surface. When he realizes that his enemies have multiplied, would he think that buying time is the right decision?\"\n\"Oh. Ohhhh...\"\nJin didn’t really understand, but she acted like she did and nodded her head. Lee Shin Woo sighed softly and continued.\n\"So, his only choice would be to move forward with his plan. He’d be forced to proceed with his plan, even though he’s surrounded on both sides. He’d then go straight for the capital, to Jissehanu.\"\n\"...You.\"\n\"Yep. At that time, I’ll force the Vampires, the Imperial Army, and Anti-Skull to fight against each other, and... in the midst of all that, I’ll achieve my own goal. Which is to kill Seagald.\"\nIn other words, everything he’d done was to kill Seagald.\nHe predicted what Seagald’s next move would be and prepared accordingly. Plus, he blocked off all of his retreat paths and forced him into the jaws of death. Eliminating the Anti-Skull bases was part of that strategy. Indeed, it was just a small part of his strategy.\n\"Shin Woo, you... what the hell did you do in the past?\"\n\"I was a businessman.\"\n\"Is ’businessman’ some kind of secret code for some sort of hit squad?\"\n\"Hahahaha.\"\nJin couldn’t understand his entire explanation, but she knew one thing: what happened when you made Lee Shin Woo your enemy. The moment Lee Shin Woo had manipulated the Magic Emperor into pursuing Seagald was the moment that signed Seagald’s death warrant...!\n\"I’m going to scout the capital, simultaneously chip away at the Imperial Army and the Vampires’ forces, and kill Seagald. These are my goals for this operation.\"\n\"So that’s what’ll act as the bridgehead for the final battle, huh...\"\n\"Haha. ...This could actually be the final battle.\"\n\"What are you talking about? You’re not going to the capital to fight the Emperor, are you!?\"\nJin freaked out and yelled. However, Lee Shin Woo just shook his head, saying that ’she got it all wrong’, but didn’t give her a proper explanation. Since he knew that she wouldn’t understand anything he said at the moment.\n\"Eeek...\"\n\"Try to understand. We don’t know if it’ll go according to plan... I’ll explain it to you once things have become a bit more clear.\"\n\"Tch.\"\nJin was pissed that Lee Shin Woo wasn’t willing to reveal his plan to even her, his partner, but she didn’t show it, as a skeleton horse wouldn’t look cute no matter how much it pouted. Instead...\n\"If you want to get out of that mess, then you’ll have to train some more. Let’s get back to training.\"\n\"Ugh... Fine...!\"\nLee Shin Woo thought back to the past few days and dry heaved.\nDuring their training, he couldn’t tell the difference between heaven and earth, or the difference between himself and Jin. But at the end of their training, he did manage to level up his Assimilation skill to level 8. However, when Jin realized this, she increased the difficulty of their training even further!\nHow harsh must that training have been if his Combat Sense skill, which grew at a snail’s pace, leveled up to level 8? It was harder to stay atop Jin’s back than fighting against the enemy!\nHe steeled himself, promising himself that he’d get through this training, but that resolve of his was torn to shreds just 20 minutes into their training.\n\"Uaaaaaaaaah!\"\n\"Not yet! Your reaction to that turn was too slow! If you can’t handle the speed, then you won’t be able to fight properly! Tense up your muscles and react!\"\n\"You’ve never even ridden a horse before, so how the hell do you even know that?\"\n\"Next. Accelerate, turn vertically, and ascend!\"\n\"Uaaaaaaaaaah!\"\nLee Shin Woo was the one who’d given her wings, but she had managed to use those wings to fly in a manner he hadn’t even imagined! Is this what he got for opening Pandora’s Box...!\n\"Uaaaaaaaah.\"\n\"Uooooooooh!\"\nLee Shin Woo choked down his tears and clung onto Jin’s back. Unfortunately, he didn’t know that him doing that caused Jin to only get worse!\nA little bit later, Lee Shin Woo finished his training with Jin and found Kratia. She was mentally exhausted, so when she looked at him, she only slightly opening her eyes and said quietly.\n\"Shin Woo, who were you fighting?\"\n\"Myself.\"\n\"Just forgive them already. You still have a lot to do, Shin Woo.\"\n\"I want to forgive her too, but Jin won’t forgive me.\"\n\"...\"\nKratia figured that Jin’s goal was a lot different than what Lee Shin Woo thought, and wondered whether she should tell him or not. But it was true that Lee Shin Woo and Jin’s skills were improving, so she decided to keep her mouth shut.\n\"I’d like to improve the Titan before you go to the capital.\"\n\"It’s not as easy as it sounds.\"\n\"If you bring the perfected Titan Core with you, then there’ll be less for me to worry about.\"\n\"So you were worried about me.\"\n\"We’re partners after all.\"\nIn a way, improving the Titan Core would prove to be much more difficult than improving the Huginn’s Eye.\nWhile he knew what areas of the Huginn’s Eye he wanted to improve and focus on, he was still at the drawing board for the Titan Core; he didn’t know how to combine the Titan Core and the Demon Heart.\n\"It’s simple. We just use it on the outside.\"\n\"Wait, you want to use this precious mana metal to make armor?\"\n\"...We’ll definitely be able to get it to level 9.\"\n\"I can already fight against level 9s. This thing can’t just be any normal level 9. It has to be an ultimate weapon that will allow me to overcome any unforeseen situations.\"\nLee Shin Woo wanted to imbue the Titan Core with the Demon Heart’s properties. The Demon Heart that was the result of the Evil Eye overlapping again and again. At this point, it was the very definition of being ’overlapped’.\nIf that ability was transferred to the Titan, then what would happen? He would not only be able to overlap his Dark Flame, but also his other flames; no, if things went well, then he may be able to surpass that and stack all of his abilities together, sublimating them into something new!\n\"Though I honestly feel like it’s just a pipe dream.\"\n\"In any case, let’s begin. We studied the Shining Flame yesterday, right? Let’s study the Dark Flame today.\"\nIn order to figure out how to harmonize different elements together in the Titan Core, Lee Shin Woo started with helping Kratia understand how each of these elements worked.\nIt was time well spent, as they not only gained a greater understanding of the Demon Heart and the Titan Core, but also increased Kratia’s control over her own element at an exponential rate. No... her skills improved even moreso.\n\"...Shin Woo.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Thanks.\"\n\"For what?\"\nLee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and manifested his Dark Flame. Kratia created an ice crystal, touched the Dark Flame with it, and smiled.\nNot yet. The Emperor still hadn’t contacted him yet. Latest content publıshed on novel[f]ire.net",

She had somehow figured out that Lee Shin Woo’s goal was to kill Seagald and had grabbed onto him.\n\"I’ll go too.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"I’m going.\"\n\"Stay here and train some more.\"\n\"Keut. I’ll go no matter what...!\"\nWhy was she clinging to him? She obviously wanted to go with Lee Shin Woo. It was easy enough to figure out, but...\n\"Don’t you remember how badly you failed last time? Don’t you think you should just stay and watch?\"\n\"This is my primary reason for living, even if I had to become an undead. I won’t overdo it. Please let me go with you.\"\nSeira was calm and collected. He didn’t know what she was thinking, but at the very least, she didn’t show any signs of insanity like before. Honestly, it would be a huge problem if she did show any signs. Since the effects of the undead curse had been completely dispelled.\n\"I beg of you, Lee Shin Woo. I’ll do everything you ask of me. I won’t be foolish like last time. Please take me with you.\"\n\"...Do you really need to see your older brother’s death that badly?\"\n\"Yes, I must.\"\nA faint light shone within her gray eyes. Lee Shin Woo realized that these were a Banshee’s Tears. The dense magic within them was difficult for even Lee Shin Woo to comprehend.\n\"Please don’t doubt me. I should be able to help you. I also practiced my Banshee abilities plenty. Right now, I’m definitely... definitely a good match for you.\"\n\"A good match, huh. Banshees specialize in mental confusion, right?\"\n\"...To be more specific, it’s the ability to manipulate a situation.\"\n\"Manipulating a situation... If it’s as you say, then it does indeed have good compatibility with my Wild Card skill.\"\nHonestly, he didn’t really know the specifics to a Banshee’s ability, even though he was the one who led to her creation. However, he’d heard that Banshees were an undead species that possessed a peculiar authority. They were an incredibly rare species and their creation required several conditions... Because of these stringent conditions, they were extremely powerful in exchange.\nMoreover, she was no normal Banshee; she was a level 8 Elder Banshee Princess. Her authority was definitely amazing. Lee Shin Woo briefly thought about it... and if he followed her logic, then she would indeed be a trustworthy ally. However...\n\"Alright, then prove it. I can’t take you with me before I have a chance to assess your abilities myself.\"\n\"Of course. It’d be nice if there were a dungeon nearby.\"\n\"You’ll find one if you follow the mana patterns of living monsters. Just wait a sec. I’m going to use the Mana Radar to... Huh?\"\nLee Shin Woo rummaged for his Mana Radar, but then stopped. Chi Paul, who should’ve been in the middle of destroying one of the Anti-Skull bases, sent him an unbelievable report.\n[We’re being pushed back, Father! Please send reinforcements!]\nHe couldn’t believe what he was hearing and listened vacantly.\n\"You’re being pushed back...?\"\nNo matter how large Anti-Skull was, their forces were split among four bases (if he included the base on the surface, then they would probably be split among five bases), so he thought his Pauls would be more than enough to clear them out. But they were being pushed back?\n[It’s the Annihilation Flame Sword God, Father! He appeared out of nowhere while we were fighting...]\n\"What...!?\"\nWhy had the Annihilation Flame Sword God, who should still be on the surface, suddenly appeared underground? Lee Shin Woo furrowed his brow at the unbelievable news and then Chi Paul added something else he couldn’t understand.\n[Huh...? He disappeared again! He sustained heavy losses, but... we have several members who need immediate treatment. Father, I apologize, but could you come personally!?]\n\"What!?\"\nChi Paul was so flustered that Lee Shin Woo couldn’t understand him! Lee Shin Woo gritted his teeth, called Jin over, and mounted her. Seira followed suit and rode behind him, grabbing onto Lee Shin Woo’s waist.\"\n\"Hey, let go!\"\n\"I’m sorry. Please excuse me.\"\n\"Shin Woo, I don’t like this girl!\"\n\"I knew that already, but the situation’s urgent, so we have to go right away. I have to go and check things out myself. Full speed ahead.\"\n\"...You got it.\"\n\"Full speed... Ouguaaaaaaah!?\"\nJin paid Seira back for treating her like some convenient ride and by the end of it, Seira looked like a reanimated corpse. In any case, they quickly arrived at their destination due to Jin running at top speed.\n[We once served the Empire together, so why do we have to fight against each other!? Open your eyes, soldiers!]\n[You’re the one in the wrong! We saw Seagald preach freedom while stabbing his younger sister in the heart!]\n[You fools...!]\nHe came to the sight of a battle in full swing between the Pauls and Anti-Skull. This base was well-hidden and was protected by a barrier, so Lee Shin Woo thought it would just take some time to break the barrier and fight them; he didn’t think the Pauls would have any problems against them. But what he saw...\n[L-Lord Paul Zero has come!]\n\"Father! My apologies, but please take care of these guys!\"\nOnce he saw Lee Shin Woo, Chi Paul, who fought more fiercely than anyone and was protecting the wounded, rejoiced and yelled. Lee Shin Woo looked at Chi Paul and doubted his eyes.\nChi Paul, who had become a level 8 Android Zero just a short while ago and had gained a body similar to Arema Steelworker’s, was a complete mess! Of his injuries, his most severe were...\n\"Burns... Chi Paul can wield fire and possesses Fire Resistance, yet he’s been burned? Then, it really was Seagald... No, did he even really disappear?\"\n\"I’m sure of it! But I believe there was some sort of condition for appearing so suddenly...\"\nLee Shin Woo listened to Chi Paul’s report and immediately activated the Mana Radar, but Seagald really wasn’t here.\nHowever, he wasn’t on the surface either. He was underground, probably in... the centermost Anti-Skull base! No wait, his location just changed. Seagald had moved to another base!\n\"This is like that damn Lich’s... Whatever, so long as he’s not here. Let’s start treatment first. Come over here if you’re dying!\"\nLee Shin Woo activated a wide range Bone Reinforcement on the wounded Pauls.\nThis was why he’d accumulated all these bones. Lee Shin Woo had expended 20% of his stored up bones all at once, fully restoring the health of the injured Pauls. They were all in perfect condition, aside from those who’d been broken into pieces and died.\n\"But in that short period of time, we lost 700 of them...\"\n\"Once he appeared, he used a widespread flame. Those at high levels were able to endure it, but anyone level 5 or less didn’t have enough resistance, so...\"\nLee Shin Woo listened to the rest of Chi Paul’s report, who sported a bitter expression despite being fully healed, and gritted his teeth. This was the first time he’d ever sustained such heavy losses since taking command of the Pauls.\nHe felt even more bitter, as he’d sustained such losses from something he hadn’t expected. If he knew this would happen, then he would’ve eschewed the idea of sending the Pauls to gain some combat experience and come himself. But it was too late to start regretting it now. His rage towards Seagald would not abate and burned bright.\n\"One of the level 7 Giants was killed. If Arogan and Ellata weren’t here, then we would’ve sustained even heavier losses.\"\nAs expected. Even now, the two level 7 Elite Titans, Ellata and Arogan, rampaged about on the frontlines of the battlefield. They had sustained some severe burns as well, but their anger gave them strength and allowed them to push through the pain.\n\"Why did Seagald show up here all of a sudden... Let’s figure that out later. First...\"\n\"This is a good place to show you what I can do.\"\nLee Shin Woo was about to rush forward to the front lines, along with Ellata and Arogan, but then, Seira, who had been drooped over, recovered and stepped into the air. Her gray hair and dress fluttered in the air.\n\"You could fly!?\"\n\"Now really isn’t the time to be asking that, is it!?\"\n[I’m a Banshee, so isn’t it only natural that I can change into an astral body?]\nHer body slightly shone. In this way, she was quite similar to an Immortal, Dana’s species. Seira realized what he was thinking and smiled slightly.\n[Perhaps it was because you revived me first that you were able to turn Dana into an immortal after. Banshees and Immortals seem similar, but they are fundamentally different. Though it took me some time before I came to that realization...]\n\"Specifically?\"\n[Immortals avoid death, but I bring death. Lee Shin Woo, you made us like this. Your ability to switch between life and death made us like this.] New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on novelꜰire.net\nShe said and entered the battlefield garbed in her fluttering dress. Lee Shin Woo saw crystals of light form around her eyes and instinctively covered his ears.\n[Gyaaaaaaaaaaahk!]\n\"Guaaah!\"\nThe frightening shriek resounded throughout the battlefield. All who heard her cry staggered. Her cry didn’t differentiate between ally or foe, and all were anguished by it. But then, something happened; something so shocking that it made him forget about what had just happened.\n[Kuhahk!?]\n[How can this be... Lord Seagald. Lord Seagald will rescue... Kueok!]\nThe grievously wounded Anti-Skull troops toppled over all at once, as if they’d planned this beforehand.\nHundreds of soldiers had been incapacitated, and the Pauls took that opportunity to finish the rest of them off. There were some among the Anti-Skull troops that died by themselves without them needing to finish them off.\n\"This is... I see. This is a Banshee’s Cry. It’s not a cry that forewarns death, but a cry that actually calls death...!\"\n[Gyaaaaaaahk! Huhiiiiiii...!]\nWhenever her screams, which sounded akin to wailing or sobbing, resounded far and wide through the battlefield, the Anti-Skull soldiers would stagger. The lower leveled, unwounded soldiers would fall to the floor, and the level 6 and 7 officers were affected as well.\n[This is our chance. Push them back!]\n[A Banshee’s Cry... This cry is helping us. It’s a funeral march. The Banshee is singing a funeral march for our enemies!]\nEveryone should be able to hear her cries, yet for some strange reason, only the Anti-Skull were affected; the others weren’t negatively impacted by her cries at all. At most, they would feel goosebumps. Although it was such a formidable authority, it could differentiate between friend and foe.\nHundreds of Anti-Skull troops met death at the hands of her cries, and then hundreds more died. When Lee Shin Woo had first arrived, the battle was a close one, but now, the fight had entirely turned in the Pauls’ favor!\n\"This... has elemental power mixed in.\"\nIn the midst of all that, Lee Shin Woo came to a realization. She wasn’t just crying. Seira was imbuing her cries with the light element.\nLight was the power of severing. With it, she wouldn’t allow it to affect anyone on her side... In other words, she was controlling it so that it wouldn’t affect anyone in the same contract as her! It wasn’t something just anyone could do. Seira could proficiently wield the light element, so it was possible for her!\n’...Wait a sec. Isn’t this the first time that that granny’s actually making herself useful?’\nLee Shin Woo thought momentarily, but it was obvious she’d hate him if he said it out loud, so he kept his mouth shut.\nA Banshee’s Cry resounded through the battlefield once more. And 30 minutes later, the battle ended.",

    "content": "<Chapter 50. The Battle Against Seagald - 1>\n\"So is there anyone here who can tell me what happened in detail?\"\nThe battle was over. While the Pauls were collecting the loot, Lee Shin Woo gathered the commanders in one spot and held a discussion. He may be able to gain some info from the Anti-Skulls’ bones, but it wouldn’t be the same as hearing it from those who actually fought against Seagald himself.\n[Excuse me...]\n\"Huh? A-Ah, sure.\"\nLee Shin Woo looked at Shino Rendu, who had carefully raised his hand, and smiled bitterly. His gaze wasn’t directed at him, but at Seira, who was a bit behind Lee Shin Woo. Shino’s hands shook and his gaze wavered. He resembled a drug abuser, so it was kind of frightening.\n[Could I please... talk with her a little bit?]\n\"...Shino Rendu. It’s been a while. I see you were following Lee Shin Woo all this time.\"\n[Y-Yeah. That means...]\nNow that he thought about it, Shino Rendu one-sidedly loved Seira in the past! He’d forgotten all about it because it hadn’t mattered; he never imagined that they’d both become undead and meet each other again.\nThe others seemingly noticed the peculiar mood and tilted their heads. Whereas Seira just shrugged her shoulders.\n[Seira... No, Retadane. Why are you...?]\n\"Everyone who’s died has their own story to tell. In any case, I died; I came to an understanding with Lee Shin Woo and formed a contract with him. Right now, I’m working alongside him. That’s all.\"\nLee Shin Woo had disclosed his identity as a hero to the Pauls some time ago. Shino Rendu knew this as well.\nThe fact that he was qualified to be a hero would only serve as a positive for the Pauls; they would never see it as a detriment. Shino Rendu was the same. It didn’t matter that Lee Shin Woo was once his junior.\n[T-Then, we’ll be able to fight together from now on.]\n\"...Yes, so long as you don’t betray Lee Shin Woo.\"\n[Of course! I’m so happy that I could meet you again...]\n\"Shino Rendu, I’d rather you not give me any unwanted attention.\"\n[Ah...]\nLee Shin Woo heard and instinctively turned around. Some really sad stuff would be happening now. He decided not to listen to this. Yeah, after all, he had so much more to do!\n\"So, those who fought against Seagald... Ah, that’s right. Ellata.\"\n[Titan.]\nNo matter how many times he said it, they refused to believe that he wasn’t a Titan; Ellata took one knee before Lee Shin Woo.\nLee Shin Woo had healed her right after the battle, so her body and armor were fully repaired. However, she, as well as all those who’d fought and lost against Seagald, all sported sour expressions.\n[I discovered him because I was at the vanguard. His appearance was sudden and intense.]\n\"How did he appear? He probably wasn’t hiding here before. Did you sense space element mana? You should remember that mana that covered the Giants’ Domain.\"\n[No, it wasn’t. It was completely different. It was a shadow... A fire’s shadow.]\n\"...What?\"\n[Please excuse my rudeness, but may I touch you, Titan?]\n\"Of course.\"\nOnce he consented, Ellata carefully extended her pinky finger. Lee Shin Woo gripped her pinky and closed his eyes. The two were linked together through the darkness element, and Ellata’s memories were directly transmitted to Lee Shin Woo. Now, Lee Shin Woo understand what she meant by a ’fire’s shadow’.\n’One of them suddenly burned themselves, creating this flame, and a shadow formed from within it. ’Fire’s shadow’ is indeed an apt description of it. Seagald showed up with this. He immediately killed a level 7 Giant who attempted to stop him; that was only the beginning. He then cajoled Ellata, Arogan, and the Pauls with those flames... And then, he faded into the darkness and disappeared.’\nHe had a rough idea as to what had happened through Ellata’s memories. However, he didn’t have enough information to be absolutely sure yet. If it were as she said, then... his face stiffened and he said.\n\"Ellata, have you collected the bones of the burned Anti-Skull soldier? No, there were probably some other troops with the same ’mission’ as him. Bring me the officers’ bones first.\"\n[Understood!]\nFortunately, they were able to gather the burned Anti-Skull soldier’s bone. Lee Shin Woo immediately absorbed it, and clearly heard Seagald’s instructions.\n[Call me if something unexpected happens. You sacrifice yourself to the flame and create a fire’s shadow. And it is through this shadow that I can come over to you. That is our link.]\nLee Shin Woo was briefly silent. He realized what Seagald meant, as well as how he was temporarily summoned.\n\"...Man, I can’t put up with this any longer.\"\n\"Shin Woo!?\"\n\"No, not yet. Let’s look through a few more. Bone Reinforcement!\"\nHe was already sure of it, but he absorbed the other officers’ bones regardless just in case he was misunderstanding something. However, Seagald had given the other officers the same instructions; he couldn’t find a single artifact on their bodies, so he sighed and accepted the truth.\nThe bastard didn’t use spatial magic or a unique artifact. It was more of an intuitive and logical power; it was none other than an innate element. A power that differed from Annihilation Flame at that!\n\"This asshole had two innate elements. Man, he really fooled me. So he was taking it easy during our fight, huh... He’s really starting to resemble me more and more.\"\n\"Really!?\"\n\"What part of that surprised you? Say it.\"\nHe wasn’t one to talk; after all, he possessed three innate elements. However, Lee Shin Woo was really frustrated. All of Lee Shin Woo’s innate elements focused on cause-and-effect, whether it be erasing it, stealing it, or reversing it. Yet, Seagald’s innate elements were completely different!\nBut because his innate elements were so heavily specialized, he could make better use of his Wild Card skill, which manipulated cause-and-effect. Even so, he was still jealous of Seagald.\n\"He has two innate elements? To think there was someone else like you... Was Seagald a businessman from Earth too?\"\n\"If he was, then I’d be able to talk to him.\"\nLee Shin Woo smiled weakly at Jin’s joke and went through the Anti-Skulls’ memories once more. What name would fit for that innate element? Well, he called it a fire’s shadow before, so Fire Shadow should work. What a confusing name.\nNow that he thought about it, everyone he fought lately possessed a fusion element of darkness and something else! The Undead Emperor definitely had something like that, and if that’s the case, then it was definitely a sign of power inflation in the second act!\nJin still looked curious, so Lee Shin Woo gave her a brief explanation.\n\"Jin, you know that darkness has the power to form connections, right?\"\n\"Oh, can Seagald use the darkness element too?\"\n\"Seira, who he’s blood-related to, was able to use the darkness element once she became undead. So, it’s not unusual that he can use the darkness element. On the contrary, he’s a genius for being able to fuse the fire and light elements together, so it would be strange if he couldn’t handle the darkness element.\"\nOf course, his darkness was much weaker than Lee Shin Woo’s. However, it was different if the darkness element was fused with another element.\nFire Shadow! His subordinate would sacrifice themselves, creating a shadow from the resulting flame, which would link him and his subordinate together. The Fire Shadow element was at the very peak of transportation abilities and was also a trick. With the addition of his stealth ability, Annihilation Flame, as well as his combat abilities... Lee Shin Woo couldn’t help but laugh.\n\"When I fought him, I did my best, but he was holding back the entire time.\"\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo could use the fire element at the high rank level and had mastered the darkness element. If Seagald had actually used his Fire Shadow ability in front of Lee Shin Woo, then the victor would have been decided in an instant: Lee Shin Woo would have won right then and there.\nBut Seagald shouldn’t have known that. In other words, he had been holding back. That really pissed him off.\n\"However...\"\nThings would be different now. Lee Shin Woo thought that he’d miscalculated, but after learning about all the circumstances, he realized that Seagald had actually miscalculated.\nIf he really wanted to hide his Fire Shadow ability, then he should’ve hidden it until the very end, regardless of how many of his subordinates he had to sacrifice.\nHowever, he had given his subordinates an option of summoning him with Fire Shadow, and as a result, Lee Shin Woo had learned about the ability.\n\"He travels through the Fire Shadow. The moment he uses that ability against me...\"\nHe could make it so that Seagald couldn’t escape the shadow, or he could make it so that Seagald would burn eternally.\nIndeed, he’d finally satisfied all the conditions of Wild Card! Lee Shin Woo tightened his fist and then Jin asked.\n\"But why did he appear and then disappear all of a sudden, Shin Woo? It would’ve been the perfect crime if he killed all of your troops and then left before you arrived.\"\n\"It’s obvious if you think about it a little, Jin.\"\n\"I don’t like that about you. Take it down a level.\"\nLee Shin Woo felt that he might’ve gone a bit strange, as he felt that Jin’s sulking voice was cute. He grinned and said.\n\"There are four Anti-Skull bases.\"\n\"Ah, I see! Seagald showed up at the other bases too!\"\n\"Bingo.\"\nLee Shin Woo had originally split up his troops without much thought. At the time, he thought that destroying all the bases would be tougher on Seagald, but he hadn’t expected that it would result in this!\n\"Seagald must’ve thought when he was called at different locations simultaneously. ’Should I stay, or should I move on to the next one?’ But think about it. There were a ton of Pauls here and even if he did his best, he wouldn’t be able to save a lot of his troops. He judged that it was better to save another base than to stay here, which was a lost cause.\"\nAnd it did indeed turn out that way. Aside from the level 8 and two level 7s, the other three bases were attacked by three groups of 100 level 6 Vampires. If not for Seagald, then they would’ve been able to take over the other Anti-Skull bases. But now that Seagald was coming...\n\"The Magic Emperor will be pissed. He lost track of Seagald on the surface and would lose the generals he sent underground... Now that he knows how dangerous Seagald is, he won’t be able to give up. He has no choice but to come out even stronger.\"\n\"...Yeah. This wasn’t even your intention, but it turned out to be beneficial for you, Shin Woo. Heot, did you plan all this out Shin Woo!?\"\n\"Of course I did! I’m always a step ahead!\"\nHe was lying, of course. If he knew that Seagald was going to come out like this, then he would’ve accompanied the Pauls here! But he would lie as much as necessary to shock Jin!\n’...But now that it’s come to this...’\nLee Shin Woo’s was busy thinking, even while joking around with Jin. If the surface got more involved than he’d first planned, then there would be a higher risk. Above all, he would have to push forward the date of the final battle...\n’Sseup, I guess it can’t be helped. I just have to do everything I can.’\nLee Shin Woo couldn’t do anything about it. The only thing he could do was create the ideal stage with the conditions he was given! He flashed Jin a smile, who was looking at him astonished and was formulating a plan in his head.\nThɪs chapter is updatᴇd by novel·fiɾe·net",

    "content": "<Chapter 50. The Battle Against Seagald - 2>\n[Seagaldddddddddd! That bastard tricked me!]\nThe Emperor seemed pissed; it was only natural. After all, all of the Vampires he’d dispatched had been killed, including the level 8 Steel Armor General. Even Lee Shin Woo hadn’t thought that the level 8 general would be killed so easily!\nOnce he’d finished cleaning up, he led his Pauls in a quick retreat. Seagald had accepted his subordinates’ summons at each base, and the Vampires were unable to withstand his assault and died.\n[I apologize, Your Majesty. If I hadn’t divided our forces, then...!]\nThere was some good news though. Through his and the Vampires’ attacks on their bases, Anti-Skull’s forces had been cut down by a good 1/3. However, that wouldn’t be enough to cause the Emperor’s anger to abate.\n[Raise your head, Arema. That won’t solve anything! We have to kill him!]\n[But Your Majesty...!]\nLee Shin Woo trailed off. The Emperor should already know. That entrusting the Metal God General alone with eliminating Seagald, who could suddenly appear and disappear anytime he wanted and had even killed a level 8 Vampire, was too much to ask for.\n[I’ve completely destroyed all of his forces on the surface, so he won’t be able to return. He won’t be able to fool the golem network anymore either. ...So Arema, I need to trouble you for just a little while longer.]\n[...Of course. I am ready to give my life for you, Your Majesty.]\n[No, I’m sorry for giving you such a difficult task. But my friend, I won’t let you die in vain. I’ll send you as many reinforcements as I can.]\nUltimately, the cowardly Emperor chose the second best plan instead of the very best.\nThe Emperor was under the assumption that ’Arema’ had no choice but to obey him, as he held his strings (his physical body), but to the current Arema... or Lee Shin Woo, it was the best possible outcome!\n[I’ll send all the forces I have available. So remember, you have to stop him. Don’t let those filthy undead covet the surface. Understand?]\n[...Understood! I promise to do as you ask!]\nThe line went dead. Lee Shin Woo briefly pondered and soon extended his hand towards the communication device. Then, the device made a ’crunching’ noise, turned to bone, and was absorbed by Lee Shin Woo.\n[Magic has increased by 10.]\n[Through your mastery of the Darkness Element, you were able to trace this darkness back to its source. The coordinates have been added to the Heaven Door’s Key.]\nFrom here on out, he wouldn’t communicate with the Emperor anymore. He was probably sending all of his forces underground, aside from a small handful that he needed to protect himself. Since he was sending such a large force, there was no need to contact him anymore.\n’I had no choice but to use my own darkness to dispose of the communication device; otherwise, he would’ve known that it was tampered with. And...’\n’Would it really work out?’ Lee Shin Woo had thought, but he had achieved his secondary objective: trace the darkness back to its source and figure out where the Emperor was hiding.\nWhen would the Emperor figure this out? ...He would probably never figure it out. By that time, he’d have a sword slicing through his throat.\n\"Now, let’s make a dummy and put it over here...\"\nDarkness radiated from his fingertips and formed into a solid shape. This dummy device was created so that the Emperor wouldn’t realize that the original communication device was damaged, and would act as a receiver that only ’received’ his signals.\n\"Thanks, Arema Steelworker. You really did a lot for me.\"\nLee Shin Woo put away the device, returned to his original form, and muttered in satisfaction. Then, he left the room and locked it. He saw Kratia right in front of him. It might’ve been just him, but she seemed pretty impatient.\n\"Let’s hurry up and improve the Titan.\"\n\"I have to go once the surface sends reinforcements. Can we really do it before then?\"\n\"We have to. Seagald’s dangerous, the capital even more so. The more unknowns there are, the more you have to prepare, Shin Woo.\"\n\"You’re right, but...\"\nHonestly, Lee Shin Woo’s side was a force to be reckoned with. He had five level 8s, which included himself, Jin, Chi Paul, Seira, and Dana, along with several level 7 Giants, which had exceptionally high physical stats; he couldn’t even count how many he had with both hands.\nYe Jin Jin (she had recently hit level 7) wore a level 9 artifact and was accompanied by the level 8 spirit, Zenon, so she was probably more powerful than most level 8s as well.\n’Even though both sides have a level 9 boss, I think I can take them on with these forces.’\nDespite that, Lee Shin Woo was still busy setting up the board. Why else would he be doing this? Because something unexpected could pop up out of nowhere.\nAfter all, Lee Shin Woo himself was an unknown that hadn’t existed just two years ago. The Underground Empire had changed this much with his sudden appearance, so it would be foolish to assume that his enemies were exactly the same. Seagald was a clear example of this.\n\"Where’s Seagald going?\"\n\"He’s going around the bases and collecting all the surviving troops. He’s almost done... When he’s finished, he’ll probably go straight to the capital.\"\n\"As I thought.\"\nLee Shin Woo thought as much. When Seagald had come for Bayran, he thought that the battle was coming to an end. The Emperor probably thought the same; several of the 12 Generals had been killed and the capital had sustained a blast of light from the cannon.\n\"Shin Woo.\"\nKratia stared right at Lee Shin Woo, who was organizing his thoughts. He felt like he knew what she was going to say.\n\"I’m going too.\"\n\"You can’t.\"\n\"Jin’s going.\"\n\"She’s level 8... No, I just can’t go without her.\"\n\"...\"\nIf Jin were here, she would’ve smiled in delight, despite knowing that that wasn’t what he meant.\nOf course, Jin wasn’t the one in front of him, but Kratia. She was puffing up her cheeks. Kratia was being quite expressive for such a cold magician.\n\"But Seira’s going too.\"\n\"She keeps insisting that she sees her older brother’s death. And she’s level 8 too.\"\nOriginally, he hadn’t intended on bringing Seira along, but due to her insistence, as well as seeing her authority as a Banshee in the previous battle, he caved. Her abilities were really compatible with his own. He would be able to maximize his abilities as a Joker with her around.\n\"I can help too.\"\n\"Yeah, you would help. But the problem’s that you’ll be in danger.\"\n\"But you’re the one in the most danger.\"\n\"I’ll be fine; even if I’m killed, I won’t die. Don’t you worry, I can get out of any situation.\"\nHe didn’t lie unnecessarily. In the end, Kratia sighed at Lee Shin Woo’s boasting and said.\n\"...Shin Woo, you’re a precious sample, so you’re not allowed to die.\"\n\"I’m glad that you’re concerned about me, but could you do something about that title...\"\nHe smiled bitterly and softly patted her shoulder. In order to take her mind off of it, he needed to...\n\"Let’s improve the Titan. I’m trusting you. Since I’m taking time out of my practice time with Jin, we have to get somewhere with it.\"\n\"Leave it to me. I’ll do it no matter what.\"\nFrom that moment on, the two focused on nothing else but fusing the Titan Core and the Demon Heart together. No, it wouldn’t be a wrongful assumption to say that they were trying to use the Demon Heart to fundamentally strengthen the Titan Core.\nThe Titan was a weapon that amplified Lee Shin Woo’s abilities, and in order to turn it into a shield that could protect him, he overlapped all of his abilities and melted them into the darkness. But, in order to transform it into an absolute weapon that turned lies into truth...!\n\"...Ah.\"\n\"Shin Woo?\"\n\"It might work if we limit its potential.\"\nThe Titan was currently infused with the Dark Flame element; divided, that made the fire and darkness elements. And the Demon Heart’s overlapping ability definitely originated from the darkness element.\nWhen he first planned out the Titan’s improvements, he thought he could use the Demon Heart as a medium to fuse all his elements together, but that was impossible from the very beginning. Lee Shin Woo himself didn’t wield that many elements together at one time.\n\"But what would happen if I used darkness as the foundation and then combined all my flames with it? Won’t that work?\"\n\"In other words, you’re going to add your Shining Flame too? But that’s the light element. The reinforcement will become unstable unless you can grasp the fusion element between light and darkness. The reason why elements can’t be overlapped is because conflicting elements can’t mix very well.\"\n\"Mm...\"\nLee Shin Woo thought long and hard. It was clear that imparting his flames into the Titan during the creation stage was impossible. Instead, focusing entirely on the fire aspect and maximizing that would increase the Titan’s strength much more...\nThen, Kratia spoke, as if she’d come up with an idea.\n\"...Shin Woo, how’s this?\"\n\"What is it?\"\nKratia was struck with inspiration. She drew a large X through their current blueprint and drew the Titan Core and the Demon Heart’s mana circuits such that even Lee Shin Woo was able to understand it. Then, she began explaining.\n\"Changing the Demon Heart’s properties during the planning phase is impossible. Then what about making two different types of circuits?\"\n\"As expected.\"\nDepending on the way the Demon Heart was used, the Titan’s functionality would change. If that’s the case, then Lee Shin Woo didn’t need to think about it. Kratia saw him nod his head, and she herself nodded and said.\n\"First, make a simple circuit that goes straight from the Demon Heart to the Titan Core. If you activate this line, then the Demon Heart’s defensive capabilities should transfer to the Titan. Let’s call this Normal Mode.\"\nNo matter how he looked at it, she really was a genius. He honestly didn’t really understand what she was talking about, so he felt like he had become like Jin and just nodded his head. Kratia then created an even more complicated magic formula atop the plan and said.\n\"If Normal Mode is when the Titan is connected with the Demon Heart, thus reinforcing it, then the next mode is a bit different. You instead connect with the Demon Heart and then that connects with the Titan Core. Let’s call this Showdown Mode. We’re going to make these two lines and make it so that you can switch between them.\"\nWhile the former idea, where the Titan gains the Demon Heart’s defensive and magical abilities, was a simple concept (this improvement was always possible), the latter idea was so complex that it could only be derived from Kratia’s genius. Since this method would first involve Lee Shin Woo passing his power through the Demon Heart, thus reinforcing it, and then he would activate the Titan Core after.\n\"In other words, this mode will allow me to directly control the Demon Heart. You’re making it so that I can control the Demon Heart myself and preserve its overlapping ability... And that power will spread throughout the Titan.\" Fresh chapters posted on novel★fire.net\n\"Yep. Then you just need to use the Demon Heart’s overlapping ability to overlap your Dark Flame and Shining Flame. Then, you apply it to the Titan. Because it’s a lot more stressful on you, the Titan’s safety and durability will decrease, but this is the only way.\"\n\"Sorry to say, but it’s too chuuni. ...And ultimately ’overlapping the Dark Flame and Shining Flame’ falls to me. Well, I was the one who suggested it, so it’s only right that I take on the burden!\"\nIt was quite sudden, but fusing together two conflicting powers was totally like combining items! ...Wouldn’t it be possible?\n\"But there’s also something else I’ve thought of. If you can use the overlapping power properly, then this should be possible too.\"\nBut Kratia didn’t stop there. Maybe she’d already thought of the theory and application. She drew the structure of the core, as well as the inside of the Titan itself, causing Lee Shin Woo to sport a doubtful expression.\n\"Hey, this is...?\"\n\"In conclusion, controlling the Dark Flame and Shining Flame so that they can be overlapped by the Demon Heart. There’s a way to control them. I don’t know what lays beyond that, but...\"\nLee Shin Woo looked at the completed interior design of the Titan and shuddered.\nWith this, he could definitely...\n\"That... might be possible.\"\nThat night, they finished upgrading the Titan.\nThe very next day, the troops from the surface arrived in the Underground Empire.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 50 part3",
    "content": "<Chapter 50. The Battle Against Seagald - 3>\nToday was the day that Lee Shin Woo would meet with the second group of Vampires and head towards the capital. He left the Metal Army base and arrived at the secret rendezvous location, but was at a bit of a loss.\n[It’s a pleasure to meet you, Lord Arema Steelworker, the Empire’s Guardian!]\n[It’s an honor to meet a Steelworker!]\n[For the Emperor!]\nThere was, of course, no problem with the quality of the army. Two more level eight generals had come, and they were definitely more powerful than the Steel Armor General.\nThat wasn’t all. Though they weren’t part of the 12 Generals, there were still five level 7 elites amongst the 500 level 6 elite Vampires. The Emperor truly did send his best. However...\n\"It’s been a while, Arema Steelworker.\"\n[...It really has been a long time.]\nAn unknown woman acted like she knew him, with a really displeased expression at that. ’Beauty’ was the most apt term for this charming middle-aged woman, but it really didn’t matter to Lee Shin Woo either way.\n[Lv8 Light General Sorura Von Lilaine - Elder Vampire]\nShe must’ve known Arema Steelworker for a long time. Lee Shin Woo had figured out her name but didn’t know anything else about her, so he contacted Chi Paul and tried to get some info on her. However, he wasn’t able to get much on her. What he did know was that she really wasn’t a relative.\n\"You went so far as to become a golem and come down here, yet you weren’t able to do anything right, let alone fulfill your mission; ultimately forcing me to come down to this wretched place.\"\n\"Hahaha. Forgive her, Arema. Madam Lilaine is just happy to see you. She knows more than anyone how much you’ve sacrificed and what you’ve achieved here. Isn’t that right, Madam?\"\n\"How ridiculous. No matter how much you’ve achieved in the past, it doesn’t matter if you fail now. I’m so ashamed that I was once at the same level as this man.\"\nThe other level 8 general was a middle-aged man, called the ’Sun Spear General Judika Von Beloduns’ (he was also an Elder Vampire as well), and he likewise acted like he knew Arema, but Lee Shin Woo didn’t know who he was either. They weren’t suspicious of him, as he maintained Arema’s basic qualities, but...\n\"Oh my. It seems to me that Arema has gotten just as strong as we have. Isn’t that right, Arema?\"\n[Hmph. There’s nothing for me to say. You’ll see soon enough.]\n\"Haha, you’re still the same.\"\nTo think that he’d run into this kind of problem. He was briefly puzzled, but soon realized that the Emperor had sent generals with the same standing as Arema himself; they had served the Emperor just as long as he had, and they had achieved just as much.\nLee Shin Woo realized this and decided to throw out a feeler.\n[If you all came down here, then what about the surface?]\n[Don’t worry about the Emperor’s safety, Arema. One of the Four Heavenly Commanders is still by His Majesty’s side.]\nBingo! As expected, these guys were part of the Four Heavenly Commanders! He’d learned that the surface’s four strongest generals were also called the Four Heavenly Commanders when he was on the surface. He hadn’t known who they were, but now he knew who three of the four were. Including Arema that is.\nSo that’s how it was. Arema was part of the Four Heavenly Commanders on both the surface and underground... Even though he had died the simplest death of the Four Heavenly Commanders! He inwardly laughed, and the LightGeneral, Sorura Von Lilaine furrowed her brow once more and said.\n\"Kuroin Von Begner... I don’t like his attitude. He was the first to accept becoming a Vampire, and he acts like he’d lick His Majesty’s feet if he just asked him...\"\n\"Those words can be construed as disloyalty towards the Emperor, Madam.\"\n\"I just want to maintain peace in the Empire. His Majesty knows how I feel. Moreover, I ended up becoming a wretched Vampire too. So don’t nitpick, got it?\"\n\"Hoo. As always, you’re quite fussy, Madam.\"\n\"And you’re always noisy and annoying.\"\nLee Shin Woo just watched the fussy woman and the chatty man. If he were being honest, then he felt like they were good people. But they were going to die anyway, so it didn’t really matter.\nBut it concerned him that they knew Arema Steelworker from a long while back. If his identity was exposed half-way through the operation, then he would have to kill these precious soldiers right then and there. If he knew this would happen then he would have absorbed Arema Steelworker directly (though he’d feel a bit sorry for Chi Paul)...\n’No, there’s no point in regretting it now. I can do it. I can act like him with just the info I have on hand. Only then can I call myself a true Joker.’\nWhen he was still in South Korea there was a voice phishing scam that worked by just knowing one’s name and telephone number. It was the most simple, but also most advanced level of trickery that anticipated one’s responses and behavior while leading them to give you what you wanted.\nBut Lee Shin Woo already knew Arema Steelworker’s personality, and could perfectly replicate his appearance and voice. There was no way he couldn’t do what so many other swindlers could!\nThen, the Light Generalapproached him, slapped his back, and said curtly.\n\"You’re just as slow as ever, Arema. How long do you plan to dawdle around? If you’re ready, then wipe that stupid expression off your face and give the order to march.\"\n[Mm.]\nIt was really difficult to measure how close they were.\nBut if they were close enough that she told him to hurry up and give the order, then despite the hostility that she showed him earlier... she didn’t seem to really hate Arema Steelworker. She was essentially acknowledging that he had the right to command them, including her.\nLee Shin Woo snorted and said.\n[I’m glad you have my back. I hope you stay like that when you fight against Seagald.]\n\"Are you looking down on me? I won’t be defeated like you. You won’t get a chance to do anything, Arema. Just think about a way to safely get into the capital.\"\n\"His Majesty told me that you knew where Seagald was. Do you have a surefire method of finding him? Or do you have an artifact that can find him?\"\n[It’s nothing so amazing. My subordinates scoured the underground for dozens of years, so I was able to find his bases. In exchange, I lost some of my precious subordinates, but... He shouldn’t be able to hide within the capital. Especially if his goal is Jissehanu.]\n\"As expected.\"\nThe Sun Spear General shrugged his shoulders and narrowed his eyes. He was doubting him... No, a person who was about to joke around often looked like this.\n\"You stuck by Jissehanu’s side for dozens of years, so you should know the capital like the back of your hand.\"\n[Don’t make it sound like I feel anything for Jissehanu. All I feel for him is hatred. You’ll make me feel nauseous.] Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on n0velfire.net\n\"Haha. I’ve never doubted your loyalty, Arema. Anyway, be more friendly, like old times.\"\n[You and I? Don’t make me laugh.]\n\"Kek. You’ve gotten even more rigid. Seems like Madam Lilaine is going to have a hard time... Ugh!\"\n\"You... I told you to shut up!\"\nGood, it worked! They weren’t suspicious of him at all! It felt like they were tested him whenever he spoke, but he got a feel for it with his comment. Lee Shin Woo smiled and took a step forward.\n[Are you all ready?]\n[Yes, sir!]\n[Good.]\nThe Vampires were frozen stiff, as they couldn’t interfere with the Four Heavenly Commanders’ conversation, and the several hundred level 6 golems Lee Shin Woo had prepared were likewise all lined up.\nLee Shin Woo spared a glance at one of the golems, coughed, and then turned his gaze towards the rest of the troops.\n[Listen up! That rebel, Seagald Von Retadane, dares to challenge the Emperor, who rules over both the surface and underground and had the gall to confuse His Majesty with his petty flames! Right now, he’s headed towards the underground capital. He’s going to use that poor ability of his to brainwash Jissehanu and attempt to tread upon the surface. Not only has he troubled our great Emperor, but that dirty skeleton is trying to hurt our innocent citizens. We can’t let that happen!]\n[No, we can’t!]\n[We have to kill him!]\nThe Vampires were enthralled and responded strongly. Lee Shin Woo’s overwhelming pressure caused them all to unite as one. Even the LightGeneral, whose hand was shaking the Sun Spear General’s head, was surprised and widened her eyes.\n[As one of the Empire’s Four Heavenly Commanders, I, Arema Steelworker, order you! We’re going to the capital. We’ll destroy anything in our way and present Seagald’s head to His Majesty! It’s going to be dangerous. Those fools will try to stop us. The Lich may show up too. Even Jissehanu may come. But even so, can we afford to back down!?]\n[No!]\n[The Emperor’s forces knows no retreat!]\n[That’s right! I’ll tell you once more, so listen up. We’re going to the capital! We’re going to kill Seagald Von Retadane! I’ll give you all this chance. Anyone who catches him, hurts him, or kills him! You’ll be rewarded based on your contribution! Let’s take back the Empire’s eternal peace with our own two hands. His Majesty will certainly recognize those who have died and those who have survived!]\n[That’s right!]\n[It’ll definitely go as you say, Lord Arema!]\nThe Vampires had instantaneously become one and cried out. Though some of them were indeed loyal to the Emperor, Lee Shin Woo had instantly amplified their emotions through his speech.\nEven if there were some who may have opposed the Magic Emperor, with his Lv9 High Rank Command skill, which was amplified by his Acting and Instigate skills, his speech would cause them to yell ’Aye!’.\nEven the LightGeneral’s heart throbbed, despite her not swearing fealty to the Emperor. Though in her case, it wasn’t because of the contents of his speech...\n[Alright, then. March! We won’t turn back until we kill Seagald!]\n[Uooooooooooh!]\nThe soldiers were excited. The LightGeneral and the Sun Spear General got a hold of themselves but had raised an arm alongside the soldiers. They soon realized this and lowered their arms in embarrassment.\n\"I’m surprised, Arema. When did you get so good at talking? It was as if you were a different person.\"\n[I just realized that you need several ways to command.]\n\"...Hmph. You’re still as dull as ever, but at least it seems like you haven’t regressed.\"\nThe Sun Spear General was shocked, but the LightGeneral was still as sarcastic as ever. Lee Shin Woo didn’t say anything and turned his gaze to the front. He was looking at the golem that he’d looked at before. And he spoke to that golem telepathically.\n[It was an amazing speech. I see that that’s how you’ve been fooling us till now.]\n[If you’re that amazed by my abilities, then just compliment me.]\nLee Shin Woo telepathically spoke to that golem... no, that empty shell that Seira was in and took a step forward.\nHe had taken another step forward towards the fated battle.",

    "content": "<Chapter 50. The Battle Against Seagald - 4>\n\"Don’t you want to know what’s happened on the surface during the time you were away?\"\nThe Light General, Sorura Von Lilaine. She seemed to have some strange feelings towards Arema Steelworker... No, it was probably an ongoing thing. That’s the conclusion that Lee Shin Woo came to.\n[I’m happy so long as His Majesty is safe.]\n\"You still say the stupidest of things. I told you before, without you, the Empire and the Emperor won’t exist.\"\n[Watch your mouth.]\nAt first, Lee Shin Woo had thought that there was some sort of bad blood between them. When he considered her and Arema’s personalities, he assumed that they had disagreed in politics or values. However...\n\"Don’t you want to know what’s happened to your family ever since you stuffed yourself and your relatives into golems and went underground?\"\n[His Majesty told me that he’d bestow upon me the highest position in the Empire, second only to his own. I trust that my family’s still going strong.]\n\"What unshakeable loyalty. All the other members of the Four Heavenly Generals got married and had kids, but you’re the only one stuck in that metal shell of yours. Don’t you feel miserable?\"\n[Not at all.]\n\"...I got married too. Though my husband died already.\"\nLee Shin Woo was starting to catch on. He’d thought, ’There’s no way she likes this half-wit, does she?’, but after listening to her, that suspicion became absolute certainty.\nIt seems like these two had feelings for each other when they were young! ...If not, then this beautiful lady had a one-sided love for Arema!\n’Why now? What a pain in the ass.’\nHe already had enough trouble as it was dealing with the women in his life, but now he had to deal with a woman who still loved an already dead man?\nIt felt really awkward. Since there was a higher chance that she would figure out that he was a fake. But she didn’t know that Arema was actually dead. And with a complicated expression, she grumpily quarreled with him.\n\"Don’t you have anything to say?\"\n[Should I? Am I supposed to ask about your husband?]\n\"...Has your heart become metal as well?\"\nShe responded despondently. Lee Shin Woo did his best to ignore her while Jin, who he had been riding on before, snickered. Jin was also disguised as a golem right now. Her body was originally covered in steel, so it was easy to disguise her.\n[You usually talk a lot more. What’s wrong? Is it too much for even you to accept a middle-aged woman?]\n[Knock it off, Jin. The more I talk to her, the more awkward it’ll get. I guess I just have to hope that we arrive at the capital quickly...]\nThat didn’t work as he wished either. He’d created these golems as consumables. He adjusted them so that their cores’ energy would be depleted, in return allowing them to move faster and stronger than normal. Thus, they would be able to keep up, no matter how fast the surface’s troops marched. But the issue lay with the Vampires!\n\"Keuk. That’s an artifact created through powerful light mana. Those Retadane bastards, did they predict the Emperor’s course of action and prepare this in advance...?\"\n[...You all know that Seagald can wield light, right...? If this is enough to stop you, then you’ll never be able to defeat him.]\n\"I know! We prepared a countermeasure!\"\nLee Shin Woo said sarcastically, unable to hide his disappointment at how pathetic they were. But then, the Light General replied temperamentally.\nAs her name implied, it seemed like she could originally wield light. And apparently, after becoming an Elder Vampire, she would hurt herself whenever she used the light element. Meaning that not everyone could be like Seira or Seagald, and balance both light and darkness together.\nIn other words, her becoming an Elder Vampire had effectively sealed her greatest ability. She was a complete idiot.\n[So what exactly is that countermeasure of yours? ...Did His Majesty perhaps...?]\n\"Exactly. The Emperor created an artifact that can convert the undead curse into a darkness element barrier. It’s not very strong, but it’s effective over a wide area and makes one unable to use the light element. How is it, Arema? This is an artifact that was created by His Majesty himself.\"\nThe Sun Spear General passed him a metal disk and Lee Shin Woo observed it.\nHe obviously didn’t ossify it. Not only was it not his, but the Emperor was a higher level than him. Above all, Lee Shin Woo’s Bone Reinforcement had advanced recently, allowing him some control over it.\n’As expected, it’s growing. I don’t need to feel restless.’\nHe assumed that his recent advances in Bone Reinforcement were due to his training in the Manatization skill. As he studied this skill, which allowed him to transform his body into mana, he became more capable of controlling mana and matter.\nHis Manatization skill had gotten to level 5 just recently, and this was the fruit of that effort. He was sure that the day he mastered the Manatization skill would also be the day that Bone Reinforcement and Rule of Bone fundamentally changed!\n’But more importantly...’\nHe put that past him and observed the disk. It reminded him of the pieces of metal within those liquid hand warmers he’d used when he was a student...\n[Dark Red Solar Eclipse +5]\n[Lv7]\n[Durability: 5/5]\n[Options: Once activated, the object breaks into pieces and the magic contained within is released, creating a widespread barrier of darkness. A Vampire’s abilities are doubled within this area, and the power of light is weakened. But this artifact cannot block light that far exceeds its level.]\n[This is... a consumable artifact that contains His Majesty’s power. It’s truly amazing. However...]\n\"Don’t worry, we have a few more like this. His Majesty wants this operation to succeed no matter what. Doesn’t us (three of the Four Heavenly Commanders) being here prove that?\"\n[...That wasn’t like me. I might’ve been scared of being defeated by him once before. Laugh if you want to.]\n\"No. I’m not going to laugh at you, Arema.\" For origınal chapters go to n0velfire.net\nThe Sun Spear General sported a serious expression and patted his shoulder.\n\"On the contrary, you did well to survive against him. Not only did the Emperor realize how dangerous he was, but you also went as far as to sacrifice your subordinates to find out where his bases were and what his goals are. There’s no one that can deny your accomplishments because of that. You’re still the Empire’s greatest shield. Keep your head up high.\"\n[You’re still as silver-tongued as always.]\nLee Shin Woo replied and smiled bitterly. Then, the Sun Spear General smiled in satisfaction. The Light General watched their interaction and gritted her teeth, as if in disapproval. What about the other Vampires? They were just moving their feet in silence, not daring to interfere in the Four Heavenly Commanders’ conversation.\n[Hoo, it’s gotten quiet all of a sudden.]\nIt was the second day of their march. Once it became daytime, the Vampires set up camp and took a break. While Vampires looked so human-like that they could be called demi-undead, they still possessed a critical weakness: they couldn’t operate during the daytime.\n’For undead, they’re quite a strange species. Seems like they can reproduce too. It also seems like the undead traits are minimized, like the stubbornness and the impulsiveness...’\nThis must’ve been the reason why the Emperor decided to become a Vampire, despite the undead being an imperfect existence. But did Vampires overcome all the disadvantages that came with being an undead...? If asked, Lee Shin Woo would shake his head.\nLee Shin Woo could tell, as one who had overcome all of these disadvantages. The Vampires possessed an imperfection, a more pronounced flaw than the other undead species. Their weakness during the day was one such flaw.\n’They’re not even in direct sunlight, but they’re half-asleep already. Their resistance to sunlight is weak, their senses weaken, and their mana becomes inactive... No, is this because the artificial sun is just that strong?’\n[...Huh?]\nLee Shin Woo observed the Vampires and wondered how he should fight the Emperor when the time came. But then, he suddenly felt a presence from behind him and turned around. There stood the Light General, Surora Von Lilaine. She seemed completely different from before, when she agonized under the light of the artificial sun.\n[Huh...?]\n[I know you’re surprised, but don’t be so loud. Just listen to me.]\nShe was likely talking to him telepathically through darkness element mana. He didn’t really know what was going on, but Lee Shin Woo nodded his head. Then, she sighed as if she were relieved and then continued.\n[The others are affected by a Vampire’s natural weakness to sunlight, but I’m different. I could originally wield the light element, so I can move around during the day without any problems. Though I suppose you could say that I bear a penalty just as severe myself.]\nHe thought she was a dumbass for becoming a Vampire when she could originally wield the light element, but that wasn’t entirely the case. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head in acknowledgment and then she confessed something even more shocking.\n[That’s not all. I was able to sever my connection with the Emperor. You told me that your own connection with the Emperor was severed when you were encased in a golem’s body. Isn’t that right?]\n[...]\nHow surprising. She was transformed into a Vampire through the Emperor’s power, yet she was able to sever the connection with him? What the hell was she going on about?\n[That’s what light is all about. The Emperor’s strong, but he cannot use the light element. That’s why he had no choice but to make use of me, and that’s how I was able to grasp the Emperor’s weakness.]\n[You...!]\n[Listen to everything I have to say and then make your decision. Since I brought enough information to make even your loyalty waver! If I hadn’t, then I wouldn’t have humiliated myself and become a Vampire and then come all the way down here to see you!]\n’Arema would be fuming right now’, Lee Shin Woo thought, but she continued sharply, so he kept his mouth shut for now.\n[Your body! Do you even know what happened to your body!? You don’t, do you!? Let me tell you. It’s gone. It’s gone without a trace! The Emperor just realized this, but he did everything he could to keep you from finding out!]\n[...!]\n[He hasn’t kept a single one of his promises to you; he’s just using you. Now you... don’t have a body to return to...]\n’How did she hide these feelings from him all this time?’ he wondered, as her voice was so intense, even through telepathy. Lee Shin Woo saw tears flow down her cheeks and didn’t say anything. ’Arema, you’re pretty good...’, he thought frivolously.\nWhen she’d asked if he had any interest in what happened on the surface... she probably wanted to tell him about this.\n[I can give you anything you want as proof. I didn’t come here to kill Retadane. I came here to convince you. The Emperor’s losing power. If you want to take your revenge, then now’s the time! ...If you want to keep listening, then nod your head. If not, then you can kill me or let me go. Do as you wish.]\nShe finished, and then opened her arms wide and stood there defenselessly. But her eyes were staring straight at him. To think that not only did she have feelings for Arema, but she would bring such a bombshell to light... Lee Shin Woo tried desperately to keep his lips from curling upwards.\nDoes he take the safe choice and kill her here, or does he risk exposing his identity... There was only one choice he could take.\n[It looks like a storm’s coming.]\nThe Joker nodded his head without hesitation.\nThe woman in front of him just smiled sadly.",

They had passed right through the level 4 danger zone, Bayran and then headed straight for the capital! Though he wasn’t here with the other heroes, he was still deeply moved.\n\"Is this... really?\"\n[Are you surprised?]\n\"Obviously...\"\nThe Light General was astonished; the outer fortress was completely gone, exposing the inner city within.\n\"It’s the capital, yet there are absolutely no defenses! How are we supposed to take this? Is this really the capital? Is the capital actually inside a hidden subspace?\"\n[Calm down. It wasn’t originally like this. The capital’s defensive facilities were all destroyed in a recent battle.]\n\"What kind of battle would’ve destroyed all of its defensive facilities?\"\nThe Sun Spear General had been smiling ever since they’d been reunited, but even he was stuck between shock and confusion and didn’t know what to do.\nBut it’s not like he could say ’I’m actually the Heaven Defying General and the hero Lee Shin Woo. I aimed the cannon the Lich made at the capital and shot light at it!’, so Lee Shin Woo just remained quiet. The Sun Spear General seemed to come to his own conclusion and patted him on the shoulder.\n\"Now I get how much you went through.\"\n[Hmph.]\nThis ’hmph’ was Arema Steelworker’s equivalent to ’Thanks for understanding, my friend’. It seemed to get through to them, as the Sun Spear General laughed and the Light General just sighed. Lee Shin Woo was suddenly fearful of how effective his acting was.\n[I’m sure you already know, but I’ll say it again. It’s impossible to move covertly within the capital. We need to move as quickly as possible and achieve our goal. Once we do, we have to get out of here as quickly as possible.]\n\"We know already. That’s why we’ve prepared so much.\"\nLee Shin Woo saw the Sun Spear General take out three more of the consumable artifact, the ’Dark Red Solar Eclipse’ and just nodded his head.\nYeah, he needed to trust them. They were the surface’s Four Heavenly Commanders, weren’t they? ...Even Arema Steelworker had been one of the Four Heavenly Commanders!\n[Then... Let’s get going. I can’t tell you exactly where Seagald is, so we should send scouts out to look for him.]\n\"Yeah. You know the capital best, so I’ll leave it to you.\"\nAmazing. Lee Shin Woo picked some scouts from the Vampires and golems and sent them off in various directions. Of course, Lee Shin Woo already knew where Seagald’s current location was, so scouts were unnecessary.\nHe was just sending them to provoke the Imperial Army. They would also get in Seagald’s way, as well as help adjust his timing and start the battle!\nLee Shin Woo sent his golems along the safest route, but he’d mostly dispatched them to pick up any more Evil Eye ore that might be laying around. He really hoped that there was at least a little bit left!\n[Then let’s get a move on. Judika, is the report system secure?]\n\"Of course. Don’t look down on the power of a Vampire.\"\n’I’m sorry, but I am looking down on it right now’, Lee Shin Woo was instinctively about to say, but desperately restrained himself from doing so and quickly moved forward. In his place, the Light General snorted, but the Sun Spear General just ignored her.\nLee Shin Woo realized something was off 30 minutes later. They marched through the inner city, which had been turned to ash by the cannon, and got closer and closer to the capital. While doing so, the Mana Radar picked up something.\n’This is...?’\nIt was neither Seagald nor the Archmage... It was a mana signature that Lee Shin Woo wasn’t familiar with. But then, why was the Mana Radar picking it up?\nThat reason was extremely simple. Currently, the Mana Radar didn’t just detect the mana that he was familiar with, but also any mana level 8 or over as well. And at this very moment, there was a presence headed right for them. There were also three level 7 elites around them, as well as hundreds of level 6 soldiers as well.\n[...]\n\"Arema?\"\nHow many level 8 undead remained within the Underground Empire that he wasn’t aware of? He couldn’t see their face, but he knew who it was. But the issue was: why were they coming towards them right now?\nHe looked at the Sun Spear General, who had paused and was looking at him strangely, and asked.\n[I’ll ask just in case, but you guys... No one followed you down from the surface, right?]\n\"Of course not. We came straight from the palace. There’s no way someone followed us. ...But for you to be like that... Are you saying what I think you’re saying?\"\n[It might be tough, but we got to move as quickly as possible. I’ll order some of these guys to buy us some time.]\nLee Shin Woo split 50 Vampires and 100 golems from his main force and sent them away. He was clearly sending them to their deaths, but the golems always followed orders, and the Vampires were psychopaths that were loyal to a fault, so they left without a single complaint.\nThe main force marched on even quicker than before. He already knew where Seagald was, so he picked the optimum route while acting appropriately; the aftermath wouldn’t matter.\n’However...’\nAnother 30 minutes later, Lee Shin Woo inwardly groaned. He knew they wouldn’t last long against a level 8 opponent, but this was too much; they were taken out as soon as they met them. They weren’t able to buy him any time at all.\n’But here’s where it starts. Were we able to throw off our enemies even a little? ...Mm, I guess it was too much to hope for. Then that means they have a way of tracking us.’\nTheir enemy was heading straight for them. Which meant they had a way of tracking them in real-time. He’d said it in passing, but perhaps the Archmage really did have a Muninn’s Eye! [1]\n[If you could do that, then go after Seagald. Damn it.]\n[Maybe the Lich is already after him.]\n[...You’re right.] Follow current novels on novel⦿fire.net\nAs Jin said, the Mana Radar had picked up two familiar level 8 undead fighting against each other around the capital’s inner fortress. It was Seagald and the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo had come here to prevent Seagald from meeting either the Lich or the Emperor and turn them into Anti-Skull. The fact that he was dealing with the Archmage right now wasn’t good news for him.\n’What should I do? Even if I go, the Archmage will lose to Seagald. I don’t have any time to waste. How about leading him to Seagald... No, that’s impossible, even for me. If that’s the case, then how about using the Heaven Door’s Key and sending him off somewhere? He couldn’t just shoot the gate at someone like the Meidō Zangetsuha [2]\nthe Sun Spear General was actually the one to stop him.\n\"You’re the one who knows the capital best, Arema. There’s no point in us going first. ...I don’t know who’s following us, but if one of us has to stay back, then I’ll stay.\"\n[No, if you keep going this way, you’ll eventually find Seagald. Moreover, the one who’s coming this way is probably Leofield Von Tariman. You can’t stop him.]\n\"Ha, that’s great. I always wanted to fight against him. They say his spearmanship is unmatched! As a spear user myself, I want to see just who’s more skilled with the spear!\"\n[You...]\nWhy? Wasn’t he one of the Emperor’s puppets? If that’s true, then shouldn’t he be jumping at the chance to catch Seagald?\nEven though he was acting, Lee Shin Woo was genuinely confused and trailed off. The Sun Spear General, Judika Von Beloduns spoke with a clear smile. He was being genuine for the first time since coming down here.\n\"Arema, Madam Lilaine isn’t the only one who has something they regret. I, like her, regret not stopping you that day. I can’t forget how I allowed my friend to sacrifice his bright future. So... let me do this much.\"\n[Judika...]\nLee Shin Woo believed that others acted rationally and in their best interests so that no harm would come to them. Thus, he didn’t expect Judika to volunteer to stay as bait. Human emotion truly was difficult to predict. The Light General and this guy were both difficult to predict.\nHe strived to keep his emotions from showing (this also befitted Arema’s personality) and spoke calmly.\n[Don’t die, Judika. ...But if you do die, I’ll be sure to pick up your bones, so don’t worry.]\nThat was the truth. He couldn’t let a single level 8 bone go to waste.\n\"I won’t die, so don’t worry, Arema. I’m counting on you. Since His Majesty told us to strike down Seagald without fail. His Majesty’s orders are absolute. That’s something you always used to say.\"\n[Of course. Seagald will die by my hand.]\nLee Shin Woo extended a hand, as though he were hesitating. The Sun Spear General grabbed his hand and flashed him a calm smile. He said he wouldn’t die, yet his expression said otherwise; he looked like he was ready to die.\n\"Then let’s meet up a little while later.\"\n[Got it. Come back safely.]\nHe probably wouldn’t come back. Since he could tell how strong he was...\nLee Shin Woo tried his best not to show it (to someone else, one might interpret it as him stopping himself from crying) and turned around. The Sun Spear General just grinned and began walking towards the direction of their pursuers. It was like a scene straight out of a movie.\n\"...To think he felt that way for so many years.\"\n[Indeed. It’s already been so many years; what’s he thinking? ...You’re all idiots. You and him.]\n\"...Arema.\"\nLee Shin Woo’s acting was so perfect that one might wonder whether Arema really was dead, saying ’Oh, Arema really was alive?’. He spoke brusquely, but the deep emotion within them caused even Jin to tilt her head!\nSo, how would the Light General fare? She fixed the scarf around her next and looked at him unkindly.\n\"You were just acting like you were as tough as nails. You really fooled me.\"\n[I have no idea what you’re talking about.]\n\"Ha... Even when they age, men are always idiots.\"\nShe said and looked at him warmly. If Jin didn’t know that the Light General was directing that gaze at Arema, not Lee Shin Woo, then she would be putting up a huge fuss right now.\nLee Shin Woo then thought.\n’If you keep being like this, then it’ll become harder to kill you later.’\nAnd thus, the Vampire and the Demon... Err, the hero put the Sun Spear General’s sacrifice behind them and began running towards Seagald.\n[1] T/N: Muninn is one of Odin’s ravens, like Huginn.\n[2]",

    "content": "<Chapter 51. Underground’s Sun - 1>\nThe Sun General did his job. Befitting one of the surface’s Heavenly Commanders, he was able to hold out against the last remaining Heavenly Commander of the Underground Empire.\nLeofield likely possessed an artifact that tracked their movements, and so his subordinates attacked the Sun General along with him, rather than follow the Vampire’s main force. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head in satisfaction, as he checked what was happening through the Mana Radar.\n[No one else is chasing us anymore. Judika’s holding them back.]\n\"That man... He’ll die.\"\n[You don’t know that.]\n\"Hmph. I guess it doesn’t matter. I just hope he does his job properly.\"\nHe strongly agreed with her, but he feigned indifference. The Light General changed topics, as she understood how he was feeling.\n\"...So.\"\nShe didn’t really care why the Sun Spear General had done what he did; after all, he, her biggest obstacle, got rid of himself on his own. She secretly formed a barrier so that her subordinates couldn’t hear her and said.\n\"Do we really have to kill Seagald here?\"\n[We do. I believe I already explained it to you.]\n\"Did you? I’m glad to see you haven’t been idling around all these years.\"\nThe previous day, Lee Shin Woo had acted surprised at the ’revelation’ that Arema Steelworker’s true body was gone (this was important) and conversed with the Light General. In the end, he decided to get his revenge.\nDespite that, he was still committed to killing Seagald, as Seagald’s vengeance wasn’t only aimed at the surface’s ’Emperor’.\n[He’ll eventually ravage the surface. We can’t drag innocent citizens into our affairs. We have to finish it here.]\n\"Ha. You still care so much for the people who have long since abandoned you, I see.\"\n[This world is nothing without humans.]\nLee Shin Woo said and was momentarily silent. He took out what he’d prepared while she was resting yesterday. It was an envelope.\n\"This is...?\"\n[Just in case I die.]\n\"I don’t need it.\"\n[You’ll need it. No... I want to entrust it to you.]\n\"Arema...\"\nLee Shin Woo recalled writing a personal note for himself, yet a friend of his, who he thought was quite close, had revealed it to the entire school; he used that memory to help him put on a convincingly sad expression. His face became naturally tinged in betrayal and emptiness.\nSeeing that, Jin wondered whether or not it was ok for golems to have advanced so far. Lee Shin Woo just completely ignored her consternation and continued.\n[I know. The best case scenario is me getting through this battle alive. But if I can’t return to the surface, then I hope you can do this in my stead. ...I’d like you to prove that I existed.]\n\"This is...\"\n[You don’t need to look at it now. If I die and your feelings haven’t changed, then open it. There’ll be people who can help you. There’s someone I met on the surface... He’s a hero, but he’s trustworthy.]\n\"You...\"\nThe Light General couldn’t formulate a coherent response and just stared at Lee Shin Woo.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo was acting exactly as Arema would, putting up a front that would work on Arema’s past lover! And that woman, who had loved Arema so dearly, just bit her lip and accepted it.\n\"I won’t let you die. I’ll hold on to this envelope for you, but I’ll never get a chance to open it.\"\n[...Hmph.]\nThis time his ’hmph’ meant ’You always say something that causes my resolve to waver’. At this point, Lee Shin Woo’s acting was so perfect that it was almost impossible to differentiate him from Arema.\n[Shin Woo, you’ll definitely get an Oscar this year.] Thɪs chapter is updated by novelfire(.)net\n[I’m in character right now, so be quiet.]\n[You’re not even denying that you’re from the surface now, are you?]\nFortunately, his beautiful performance, which confused himself along with everyone else, would soon come to an end. After all, he started sensing traces of the Archmage and the Annihilation Flame Sword God close by.\n’He really brought the rest of Anti-Skull with him. I’m sure of it. He’s definitely trying to end it here.’\nSeagald was planning on bringing the Lich and the Emperor to his side no matter what. If that happened, Lee Shin Woo’s forces wouldn’t lose, but the already complicated situation would become even more complicated!\n’But based on how it’s going, we’re actually at an advantage.’\nOriginally, Lee Shin Woo hadn’t expected the Magic Emperor to send two of his Heavenly Commanders down. Moreover, to think he’d be able to use one of them to hold off the underground Heavenly Commander, Leofield Von Tariman! Not only that, the Archmage wasn’t staying next to the Emperor and was facing off against Seagald.\n’Yeah, everything’s perfect. I’ll kill him here no matter what...!’\n[Yeah, even if I have to die...]\n\"I told you to stop saying that!\"\nHe instinctively muttered, and the Light General nervously yelled. He was supposed to add ’one or two times after it’, but had deliberately omitted it. She obviously didn’t know the truth.\nThis kind of thing was important. He kept saying things that foreshadowed his death! So that if he did die, they could say ’it really felt like he was going to die’!\n[Kuwaaaaaaah!]\nThe closer they got to their destination, the louder the monsters’ screams became. They were probably summoned by the Archmage himself.\nHad he been visiting the high level dungeons for that many years? Lee Shin Woo was speechless and tightened his fist. Surprisingly, his fist was covered in a blindingly bright golden mana... metal element mana!\n[You have learned the Lv1 High Rank Metal Element and Magic has increased by 100!]\nThe gold element, or more specifically, the metal element. It was an element that could only be wielded by individuals with a metal body, and although it originated from the earth element, it was both stronger and tougher than its counterpart, almost resembling pure physical force.\n\"T-That’s...!? Arema, you’re finally able to wield an element on your own. And it’s a never before seen element at that...!\"\n[I’m leading the way, so it’s only natural that I’m the one who discovered it.]\n\"...You always did hide your own achievements. You really haven’t changed at all.\"\n[Hmph.]\nWhile the element specialized in reinforcing metal, it was also possible to concentrate it and fire it off like a brute (like Arema).\nIt satisfied both physical force and mana, and was a well-rounded element that increased one’s attack and defense. And Lee Shin Woo was now able to replicate that extraordinary element...\n[When did you learn that element!? You didn’t even absorb Arema’s bones!]\n[I actually just learned it right now. I thought it wouldn’t work. I tried recreating it by basing it off the earth element, but it turns out I could do it.]\n[It just turns out you can do it... It just turns out you can do it!?]\nHe’d tried to replicate the element, but had ended up learning it instead! Lee Shin Woo didn’t know this yet, but by acting as Arema Steelworker for the past few days, he was able to completely understand him, enabling him to use his element!\n[You are exceptionally talented in handling the Metal element. The High Rank Metal Element has become Lv4 and Magic has increased by 60.]\n’Hmm, so it starts off at high rank level 4, huh? Maybe Arema’s was at this level too. Though his body was tough, he wasn’t very good at handling an element...’\nIf Arema Steelworker’s friends hadn’t come down and forced him to concentrate entirely on acting, then this wouldn’t have happened.\nIt was such a relief that Arema Steelworker had wielded the Metal element. If Arema Steelworker had possessed an innate element, then even Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t have been able to replicate it so easily!\nSeveral coincidences had coincided, creating a miracle, and that miracle caused Lee Shin Woo to advance even further. It was truly a feat befitting a Joker.\n[Huaaaaaahp!]\n’It’s a good thing’, he thought, and used his newly learned metal element to form a sphere and throw it.\nHe increased his arm’s physical strength to an abnormal level through the Manatization skill, causing the sphere to rush towards Seagald!\n[Keuk...!?]\nSeagald had sensed the distant projectile and tried evading it by erasing his entire presence, but he was facing off against none other than the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin.\nThe Archmage immediately froze the space around Seagald, so Seagald was unable to fully erase his presence. Ultimately, Seagald had lost his arm from the shoulder down. Lee Shin Woo inwardly tightened his fist and yelled ’Strike!’. It was a perfect surprise attack, a perfect combination attack, and a perfect...\n’It was a perfect dead ball, Shin Woo.’\n[I came for revenge, Seagald!]\nLee Shin Woo, like always, ignored Jin’s retort and yelled boomingly! Seagald had belatedly freed himself from the time prison and retreated; he gripped his long sword with his still good hand and looked down at him. If looks could kill, then Lee Shin Woo would’ve been torn in half by now.\n[Arema Steelworker...! After all that, you still didn’t die...!?]\n[My body, which you so lovingly broke apart, still throbs! This isn’t nearly enough, Seagald. I won’t let you die quickly; I’ll break your arms and legs and then kill you slowly...!]\nSeagald was genuinely angry. He’d lost everything in Bayran, so that’s why he could speak with such hatred! Hearing ’Arema’s’ retort, Seagald realized that he’d made a mistake in Bayran.\nIf he’d finished off Arema in Bayran, then he wouldn’t be in this situation where the surface had sent reinforcements!\n[And who is this? Aren’t you Arema Steelworker!?]\nSeveral monsters were fighting off Anti-Skull, and the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin, who was holding his own against Seagald, recognized Lee Shin Woo as well. To be exact, he recognized Arema Steelworker. Lee Shin Woo yelled in a booming voice once more.\n[Lich, I have a lot I want to say to you, but let me tell you just one thing. Let’s work together!]\n[Work together? You want me to work together with you, someone who rebelled against His Majesty, to fight against this dirty flame wielding bastard?]\n[Yeah.]\nLee Shin Woo firmly nodded his head and continued.\n[We can settle things once he’s dead. It’d be easier for you to fight against me than Seagald, no?]\n[Ha, how entertaining. You led those dirty Vampires here, yet you want me to bury my head in the sand. I know you have an ulterior motive. I really...]\nThe Lich smiled wickedly and swung his staff. At that moment, a massive buff was applied to the Vampires!\n[Like it! Fine, you rust bucket! Let’s work together!]\n[Archmage, you fool...! You’re abandoning me, who has His Majesty’s best interests in mind, to join forces with the surface. What the hell is wrong with you!?]\n[Seagald Von Retadane, you fool.]\nThe Archmage’s staff was clad in darkness once more.\n[Try again once His Majesty forgets about that beam of light you shot at us!]\nSo that’s what they thought had happened. This was great! Yeah, now that he thought about it, the Archmage had retreated early on, so he didn’t know who had shot the cannon; he mistakenly assumed that Anti-Skull was the one that had fired the cannon!\n[Didn’t I tell you that it wasn’t me!?]\n[Seagald, you bastard. How dare you lie in front of me, Arema Steelworker!?]\n\"Those that heed the Emperor’s command; all forces, charge! Bury those lowly skeletons so that they can never look up at the sky!\"\nLee Shin Woo charged, and the Light General followed him, leading the rest of the Vampires. This was a battle that would decide the very fate of the capital, yet the heroes weren’t even involved!",

    "content": "<Chapter 51. Underground’s Sun - 2>\nBecause of the giant artifact that had once lain in Bayran, the Heaven Rending Cannon... No, now the Heaven Defying Flag Bearer, all of the capital’s defenses were destroyed, and all those level 5 or lower were killed by the light blast right then and there.\nIt was the capital, so it was only right that normal level 1 or 2 citizens had resided there, but now, there was absolutely no trace of them.\nAnd thus, the capital had received a blessing of light and had become a true city of death. The blast of light had substantially weakened the undead curse as well, and even the Imperial Army, which consisted of level 6s or higher, was weakened.\n[You unleashed that horror upon us, yet you insist that you’re fighting for the Emperor? Shut your mouth, you traitor. That dirty light of yours will never shine upon the underground ever again!]\n[I already told you, that wasn’t me...! I wanted to free you from your shackles. I never intended to eliminate everything in the process!]\n[I told you to shut your mouth!]\nThe Archmage and Emperor were rightfully angry. Even the Undead Emperor, who had been content to quietly build his forces, decided to take this chance to wipe out any forces underground beside his own. And to uphold this order, the Lich was prepared to do everything and anything necessary.\nAs Kratia had said, that blast was the signal for the final battle. The moment the Heaven Defying Flag Bearer was shot, the battle had already started! ...But it had turned out a bit different from her expectations.\n[Ah, don’t you hear the cries of our dearly departed citizens? That light of yours (which severs all links) is like dust; it’s still in the air! Seagald... Seagalddddd!]\n[Keuk...!]\nThat’s right. The Emperor had decided to kill Seagald, the one they assumed had shot the light blast at the capital, first, not the heroes who had come here under God’s will, or the forces from the surface, or even the spy, Arema Steelworker!\nOnly Seagald, who had formed his own independent force and specialized in light, even after undeath, had the ability to assault the capital. At least, that’s what the Lich and the Emperor thought.\n[You fool. You foolish Lich...! Think about it. You know how much us Retadanes loved and treasured the people! There’s no way I’d do something like that!]\n[You won’t fool me! Even His Majesty is aware that only you are capable of wielding such light! Your sword is blazing with the same light, and you’re shooting at me with the very same light!]\nThe situation was really in his favor. If Lee Shin Woo hadn’t experienced converting the accumulated darkness within the cannon into light through Dark Shadow himself, then even he wouldn’t be able to believe that he’d performed such a miracle either.\nYet, the Lich hadn’t noticed the presence of Lee Shin Woo’s Shining Flame, despite taking a direct hit. Therefore, the Lich couldn’t sense Lee Shin Woo’s light element. And thus, all suspicion was pushed onto Seagald, who had come to Bayran for the express purpose of using said cannon!\n[Keuk, you’ve been deluded for so many years. That’s why I opposed the undead curse... Can you even hear me? Are you even looking at me? Feotane Von Seldin! Where did your intellect go; is it along with that soul of yours!?]\n[Ha! Seagald, you talk too much, even when your tongue’s rotted away!]\nThe Archmage was no pushover, but Lee Shin Woo (as Arema) was also supporting him right now. He rode his golem horse, which he didn’t have before, and rushed forward. Seagald grit his teeth. This wasn’t the same slow-witted Arema!\n[Arema, what did you do!? Tell me, what did the Heaven Defying General (who used you like a mere underling) do!? Don’t you think it’s strange that he’s the only one not here? You’re being used as well! It’s not too late, I can still...]\n[I told you to shut that filthy mouth of yours!]\nLee Shin Woo accumulated as much mana as he could at the end of his fist, and used the very same technique Arema had used against Seagald: the Metal God technique!\nThis technique, which suppressed the opponent’s mana, was impossible to block, even with the use of the Annihilation Flame. Moreover, the Lich supported him from behind, using his Spatial Magic at just the right time...!\n[Keuk!]\nSeagald was able to protect his last good arm by using a ton of mana, but the cost was great. Though a level 8’s mana reserves were high, they weren’t infinite.\nHe looked at the sky, as if lamenting his situation, and then grit his teeth and yelled.\n[Feotane... Please get a hold of yourself!]\n[My head’s just fine!]\n[You’re still talking, Seagald!?]\n[Keuk, Aremaaaaaaaaa!]\nMetal and fire mixed together and melted, and when both of them were gone, Seagald was engulfed in the Archmage’s Spatial Magic.\nLee Shin Woo moved away preemptively to allow way for Feotane’s magic; he then moved back in instantaneously and threw his fist. If it hit, it would definitely inflict some damage.\n[Critical Hit!]\n[Kuhahk!]\nIt was as though a sharp drill had pierced through his body and soul, ignoring Seagald’s authorities, and causing severe pain!\nWas this the power of the metal element? Was this also a part of an innate element? Seagald felt an unfamiliar fear creep up on him, rather than the pain.\nOf course, it wasn’t Arema’s ability, but the skill Lee Shin Woo received as a reward for destroying a part of the capital with the cannon, the special passive skill, Soul Strike! However, there was no way Seagald would know that.\n[Hoo, now are you prepared to face me?]\n[Arema...!]\nWas this really Arema!? Seagald was astonished as he parried ’Arema’s’ metal element reinforced strikes.\nBefore, he was a bit... weaker. He was a show-off; a spy that came from the surface that relied upon his tough body and his status as one of the Four Heavenly Commanders. What’s worse, Arema was much weaker just a few days ago when they had last fought!\nBut then how was he attacking with such agility and precision now!? Seagald then voiced such doubts.\n[Are you really Arema...?]\n[Ha. Seems like you’re the one who needs to get a hold of himself, Seagald.]\n[Anti-Skull. You tried to escape the true blessing of death with such a crude method. That’s why you’ve become like this!]\n[Grr...!]\nNormally, the Metal God General and the Archmage had absolutely no affinity, yet they were cooperating so well now, whether it be their condemnation of him or their attacks!\nHe couldn’t get away, due to the never-ending barrage of physical strikes and magical attacks. Even if he dominated the ambient mana and tried to fight back, the combination of the Lich’s Spatial Magic and the metal element’s ability to freeze his mana made it difficult to do so.\nWas it because they were both level 8? They knew exactly how to fight against him. Even he wouldn’t be able to last against the two Heavenly Commanders’ attacks forever.\n\"Push them back. Kill all those who seek to spread that filthy curse to the surface!\"\n\"Kuooooooh!\"\n\"The sun’s hot...! Light General, please hurry and use the Dark Red Solar Eclipse!\"\n\"You filthy, lifeless corpses!\"\nMoreover, there was a level 8 behind him commanding the Vampires and slaughtering Anti-Skull, so Seagald was really feeling the pressure. Now that all their bases had been destroyed, everything would be over once his subordinates died.\n[...But ultimately...]\nIn the midst of the intense battle, Seagald was barely, just barely able to retreat using his Annihilation Flame. He then looked at the sky and muttered...\n[We’re just in time.]\n[Mm...? It doesn’t matter, die!]\nLee Shin Woo felt like the air was hotter than before, but decided to not worry about that for now. The issue was that Seagald was in a strange stance.\nIn most cases, when an enemy gets into a special position, it means they’re trying to do something! It didn’t matter what he was trying to do; Lee Shin Woo knew it would be all over if he killed him, so he concentrated all his magic into his fist and struck.\n[Keuk... This isn’t enough to bring me down!]\n[Ugh!]\nHowever, Seagald let it hit him. In an instant, part of his lower body disappeared.\nAlthough he’d lost an arm and a leg, Seagald kept his balance and moved through the air! His spirit truly befitted that of a Heavenly Commander.\n[Kahahk...!]\n[If possible, I didn’t want to hurt you, but you’re a Lich, so I suppose it doesn’t matter. Try and understand.]\nSeagald had taken a direct hit from Lee Shin Woo’s attack but had simultaneously mustered up as much fire as he could and burned the Lich’s body. Even spatial element mana couldn’t erase the Annihilation Flame, and it went exactly as Seagald had wanted, completely burning the Lich.\nLee Shin Woo furrowed his brow, as he couldn’t understand what Seagald was doing. But then, Seagald extracted something from the Lich’s stomach.\n[So it was here.]\n[Kahahk...! Were you aiming for that from the very beginning...!]\n[I can’t control it with my power alone. Do you remember, Archmage? When we were still on good terms, we managed it together. The two pieces of the controller will now become one...!]\n[Kuhahk... What rubbish...!]\nHe didn’t know what this controller was for, but he knew he was trying to do something with it, so Lee Shin Woo stopped him with metal element mana and then attempted to kill him. But then, Seagald disappeared.\nIn the process, he had probably lost another piece of his body, but... He wasn’t dead.\n[Kuah!]\n[Ugh!]\nAnd thus, the powerful energy Lee Shin Woo had emitted destroyed the Archmage’s body! There was nothing more frustrating than killing one’s ally!\n’He really is fast!’\n’That’s why I told you to practice with me, didn’t I!?’\n’I thought it would be enough to catch him!’\nLee Shin Woo realized that Seagald had utilized Fire Shadow and immediately used his darkness to try to find and then destroy him. However, he soon opened his eyes wide open. He couldn’t find any traces of him.\nThat wasn’t possible. He couldn’t find him with his mastered darkness element? Even if he’d used his Annihilation Flame to erase his presence, Lee Shin Woo should’ve been able to find him. So if that didn’t work, then either Seagald had finally died, or...\n[He moved somewhere where there isn’t even a speck of darkness.] Thıs text ıs hosted at novel[f]ire.net\nHad Seagald mastered the light element? No, there was no way. Lee Shin Woo had done so with the darkness element, but it wasn’t as easy as it sounded. At the very least, Seagald’s light didn’t seem so absolute.\n[Kuaaaaaahk!]\n[L-Light General...!]\n[M-My skin! My eyes!]\nBut then... the Vampires fighting against Anti-Skull began to scream simultaneously! The Light General, having noticed that their skin quickly began to burn, realized one thing and yelled.\n\"Arema, look up!\"\n[...No way.]\nHe quickly looked up, and the sight caused him to go off character. But he thought they’d left him off the hook considering the circumstances.\nThe artificial sun, which radiated light all across the Underground Empire, was coming towards them. ...With Seagald Von Retadane smack dab in the middle of it.",

    "content": "<Chapter 51. Underground’s Sun - 3>\nWhen the surface’s traitors (that’s how the surfaced referred to the underground denizens) were chased out, they were forced to struggle desperately to survive.\nAs the surface dwellers had exiled them out of fear and envy, there were several talented individuals amongst them. And there were some whose authorities rivaled even God’s.\n[This will be our new nation. We’ll live here. ...And survive.]\nOf course, the one with the most talent was Jissehanu, the second prince who inherited the royal family’s barrier ability (which was based on the darkness element).\nAlthough he hadn’t been able to break through the Magic Emperor’s barrier, he had managed to expand the space underground, create a barrier that stabilized it and kept it from collapsing, and protected the people.\nAnd thus, he had become ruler of the Underground Empire, the Emperor.\n[Nature can flourish underground as well. The spirits will help us with that.]\nThe Elementalist Leader, who had formed an alliance with Jissehanu, recreated the miracle of mother nature over the vast land that Jissehanu had acquired.\nThe earth spirits would either flatten or uplift the land, while the water spirits were gathered to create rivers; even more water spirits were gathered to create the sea. The fire spirits provided them with much needed heat so that they could survive.\nAnd thus, that woman became one of the Emperor’s consorts.\n[My lord, I will create the sun with my light. One that shines even brighter than the surface’s.]\n[If you’re in charge of the day, then I’ll take care of the night. Let’s support this newly formed Empire together.]\nThe two with the brightest light and the blackest darkness worked together to create the Underground Empire’s sun. The light user would be responsible for sunrise, while its descent would be managed by the darkness user. The sun wouldn’t shine upon the Empire without either one of them.\nThus, they formed a new clan and were responsible for helping the Emperor maintain the Empire. Until the day of their dissent.\n[You wouldn’t have known, Arema, as one who’s come from above. That my family was responsible for maintaining this sun for several years. And now... I’ve fused together with it!]\nIt was impossible for Seagald to control the artificial sun by himself. That’s why he’d sought to transform the capital into Anti-Skull through the Heaven Rending Cannon, but he’d failed, so he decided to enter the capital directly. He lured the Lich out and then stole the other sun controller from him.\nLee Shin Woo and his group had interfered in the middle, which had made this a lot more complicated, but in the end, Seagald had succeeded. With his controller, he drew the sun towards him, and with the Lich’s controller, he was able to fuse with it.\nWhile they were fighting, Seagald had looked up into the air; that hadn’t been him acknowledging his defeat or giving up. He was trying to figure out how much time he needed to buy before he could counterattack. Though Lee Shin Woo was called the Heaven Defying General, even he couldn’t have predicted this. Seagald had surprised him a second time.\n[...Ha, you risked your life to enter the capital for that? You’ll soon disappear without a trace, so what’s the point?]\n[Hoo, hoo. I applaud your bravery, Arema. I know just how much you’ve changed in such a short period of time. But now... it’s over. If your mana was just a tiny bit stronger, then I wouldn’t be here right now. You were so close.]\nSeagald, having successfully fused with the artificial sun, acted triumphantly, as if he hadn’t been struggling against him before.\nLee Shin Woo had disabled at least half of Seagald’s body, but it didn’t matter. What would he fear, now that he had access to the artificial sun? After all, the most powerful source of light in this world was now in his grasp!\n[I grieve over the loss of Anti-Skull. If they were here, then they would’ve been happy to see a new world ahead of them!]\n[Ha, are you going to use that sun to turn the undead in the capital into psychos?]\n[It’s called Anti-Skull. The moment we become able to move forward, despite being undead, is the moment we become perfect existences. A perfect existence which can coexist with both light and darkness... A new species that can challenge God herself!]\nLee Shin Woo looked up at Seagald. It didn’t matter that Seagald hadn’t mastered the light element. Right now, he was light itself. In other words, he was fused with an almighty item that bumped his light element to its max. It was an item on the level of his Titan!\n’This bastard. His plan really came together. Moreover, he was willing to do whatever it took to achieve his goal... I really am unlucky.’\nLee Shin Woo had no choice but to acknowledge him. Seagald had managed to control the super artifact that had shined upon the Underground Empire for so many years, so he must be feeling invincible.\n’I had my suspicions. I thought it was starting to feel hotter, but I thought it was just because of Seagald’s ability.’\nTo think it was caused by the artificial sun’s descent; he couldn’t even imagine it. He thought Seagald’s objective was the Lich, but he was wrong; his objective had been to steal the Lich’s artifact and take full control over the artificial sun!\n’Each and every thing he does surpasses my imagination. He’ll probably try to use that thing to turn the undead into Anti-Skull. If missiles don’t work, then fire a nuke, huh.’\nLee Shin Woo looked at the giant sun that shined before him, as well as... Seagald, who was completely hidden within the sun, and just muttered in astonishment. Now he understood; there was no way even his darkness would be able to sense him if he was in that thing.\n\"Keuk. To think even the artifact won’t work...!’\n[That pathetic darkness of yours can’t protect you against this light. Give it up.]\nWhereas, the Light General stared at the man who’d cowardly brought a nuke with him... No, Seagald, who’d assimilated with the artificial sun, and activated the Dark Red Solar Eclipse. She was gritting her teeth, as the artifact had absolutely no effect.\nUltimately, the Dark Red Solar Eclipse was nothing more than an artifact that used the undead curse. Even if it gathered all of the darkness in the area, it wouldn’t be able to block the sun’s light (which was further amplified by Seagald).\n[Guaaaaaaaah!]\n[Y-Your... Majesty...!]\n[Kik. Kihiiiiii!]\nThe Vampires were unable to withstand the light and burned away, and the Light General instinctively foresaw her impending doom. Lee Shin Woo knew that she’d given up.\n[Run away.]\n\"I can’t do that.\"\nUnfortunately, he hadn’t been able to use her much, but she still had a job to do on the surface, so the best choice would be to send her back. She shouldn’t die here.\nBut as expected, she didn’t obey his orders. Lee Shin Woo wasn’t planning on dragging this out and inwardly sighed. He then activated both ’Command’ and ’Instigate’ simultaneously and yelled.\n[Sorura Von Lilaine! I told you to run!]\n\"Keuk! Y-You coward...! Are you trying to bear the burden alone again!?\"\n[Lilaine...?]\nSurprisingly, Seagald reacted to that name.\n[Lilaine... Ah, I see. You come from a branch family. So they were still alive.]\nSeagald’s voice resounded far and wide, revealing a secret that he really didn’t care for. As expected, there was a reason she could originally wield the light element. ...Though that really didn’t matter right now.\n[To think I’d have to kill a descendent of a branch family. But I suppose this too is fate. It seems like God has always given us such a cruel fate.]\n\"The Retadane name has long since been removed from the family register. You traitor, you’re just a terrorist attempting to spread the curse all across the world. Don’t get so cocky!\"\nSeagald’s words actually reinvigorated the Light General. She raised both her arms, causing the sun’s light to subside ever so slightly. She was really trying to fight that giant light crystal with light mana? He was absolutely gobsmacked.\n\"I’ve long surpassed the Retadanes. I’ll make you regret using that light against me!\"\n[You’re talented enough to talk big. I didn’t think a level 8 would show up in a branch family. Unfortunately... it seems like you haven’t achieved ’balance’ yet.]\n[Sorura!]\nHis Wild Card skill wasn’t entirely ineffective against Seagald. The artificial sun accumulated mana above their heads, and Lee Shin Woo, sensing danger, rushed over to the Light General with Jin and stood in front of her.\n[Kuooooooooh!]\nPure light shot out from the sun. One single property... the ability to annihilate the darkness that made up the undead, had been maximized.\nEven if she could wield light, it didn’t matter. The blast could kill her instantly! He covered her, as if he were embracing her, and then screamed.\n[Guaaaaaaaah!]\n[You’re enduring it quite well, Arema.]\n\"Arema!\"\nHis scream sounded as though the very world was on the verge of collapse; in addition, his outer shell was being melted away by the light! Seagald was satisfied by his newly acquired strength, and the Light General wept as she looked up at Lee Shin Woo from his embrace. Lee Shin Woo gritted his teeth... and then spoke once more.\n[Sorura... I’ll be brief... Run away!]\n\"But...!\"\nHer voice was even more anguished than Lee Shin Woo’s. However, he opened his eyes wide and then spoke even louder, so that she wouldn’t forget his words.\n[I said run away! Aren’t you going to get revenge for us both!?]\n\"Keuk...! But I’m...!\"\n[When you get back, make sure you take revenge...]\nLee Shin Woo opened a gate behind Sorura. He’d obviously created it through the Heaven Door’s Key, but she didn’t need to know that.\nNo one would expect an artifact of its kind to exist, as it could infinitely create portals between the underground and the surface; most people would think it was a one-time use item.\n\"Arema! Are you going to leave me again!?\"\n[You should be able to do it with their help. ...I’ll leave it to you.] The rıghtful source is ⓝovelFire.net\n\"Arema... Aremaaaaaaa!\"\nLee Shin Woo softly pushed the screaming Light General back. Her body disappeared within the gate... and soon the gate closed shut. Seagald was shocked at the realization that she was no longer here.\n[That ability...!?]\n[Hoo... You don’t need to know. But there is something I’ve been wanting to ask you.]\nLee Shin Woo was speaking so calmly, despite screaming so loudly before.\nHe sighed lengthily as if enjoying Seagald’s subtle gaze. Lee Shin Woo had used every means available to him to analyze Seagald’s state after he’d fused with the sun and had come to the conclusion that...\n[You can’t properly use the Annihilation Flame in that state, can you?]\n[Mm...?]\nWas he surprised by his question? Or was he surprised that his way of speaking had changed? The sun’s light abated momentarily. It seemed like he was using the special passive skill ’Arrogance’, which was used when a strong opponent ’was sure of their victory’, as he obliged him.\n[While the Annihilation Flame is indeed my specialty, it’s not enough to control this giant artifact, which has condensed light energy for hundreds of years. But this is good enough. I can fulfill all my goals with this light...!]\n[Ah, so that’s how it is. I was wondering. So you can only wield light in your current state, huh? Only ’light’...]\nIf that’s the case, then this battle...\n\"This battle is already over.\"\nLee Shin Woo, the wielder of Max Light Resistance, shed his golem skin and smiled.\nThe performer’s smile lit up blindingly beneath the underground sun.",

    "content": "<Chapter 51. Underground’s Sun - 4>\nIt had been strange from the very beginning. Seagald had taken control of such a tremendous artifact and was now capable of using light at its maximum potential, yet rather than use that light to supplement his ’Annihilation Flame’, he insisted on using just the light element alone.\nHe thought, ’It wouldn’t hurt to ask’ and Seagald actually gave him his answer. Well, it made sense. Intermediate... No, even High Rank Annihilation Flame wouldn’t match up to a mastered light element. Well... at least when their opponent wasn’t as ridiculous as Lee Shin Woo and possessed maxed Light Resistance.\n\"Well, I guess it does happen in games. The boss changes their type or their attack pattern halfway through the fight, but it usually doesn’t make the fight easier...\"\nSeagald’s only mistake was not assessing the situation properly; he wasn’t aware that the unthinkable happened and two heroes who possessed max Light Resistance stood before him. Then again, Lee Shin Woo would’ve still been able to win without it!\n\"Hey, do you have an ’Arrogance’ passive too? You’re being really condescending right now... What’re you going to do if he returns to his original form?\"\n\"Jin, you’ve been a bit more prickly lately.\"\n[...!?]\nAll the nuisances were gone now. The ’sun’ looked down at Lee Shin Woo and Jin, who’d returned to their original forms, and just shook.\nHe was confident that he’d prepared for every possible variable, so why? At this very moment, Seagald Von Retadane’s head was completely empty. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the end of it.\n\"I feel bad that Seira won’t get her turn.\"\n[Seira?]\nLee Shin Woo remarked abruptly, and Seagald instinctively replied. Then, a golem that lay a step away from the battlefield awkwardly moved forward.\n\"...Hoo.\"\nThe golem’s outer shell was halfway melted, but surprisingly, an undead popped right out. It was none other than the Elder Banshee Princess, Seira.\n\"I knew you would be able to defeat him without my help, but you were way too disheartened from losing your prey just once. To be honest, I don’t think you really needed to prepare all that much.\"\n[Seira...!?]\nSeagald couldn’t understand what was going on; even if he did, there wasn’t anything he could do about it. Thus, Seagald stopped thinking altogether.\nNo, that was actually a lie. Even if there was nothing to be gained, he couldn’t help but keep thinking. He had so many questions, even though those questions had developed from a small twister into a raging typhoon.\n[Seira...!]\nWhy? How? Unfortunately, Seira completely ignored Seagald and just looked at Lee Shin Woo, speaking curtly.\n\"I just wanted to watch you end my older brother from close up. You’re being so cocky, but you won’t lose him a second time, right? If that happens, then I really will look down on you.\"\nSeira, who’d gotten her first breath of fresh air in a few days, stretched her arms and took a deep breath. She narrowed her eyes at Lee Shin Woo, who was acting so conceited right now. Of course, Lee Shin Woo had mostly expected that kind of response from her and just snorted.\n\"Don’t worry. He won’t get away from me this time. He has nowhere to run.\"\n[Won’t get away? Keuk...!?]\nHearing that, Seagald instinctively gathered his mana, but soon realized what Lee Shin Woo meant. The sun had cast a giant shadow underneath it... and there were a dozen weapons burrowed within those shadows, restricting Seagald’s movements.\n[That’s...!]\n\"I prepared this to use against your second innate element. Anyone can do this if they master the darkness element.\"\n[Keuk. Keuk...!?]\nLee Shin Woo couldn’t find Seagald before, as his shadow had disappeared. But now that he had assimilated with the sun... the world was filled with darkness that could imprison him.\n\"Shadow doesn’t exist within light, but light always casts a shadow. The brighter the light, the greater the shadow; just like you right now.\"\nIt had been difficult for Lee Shin Woo to track Seagald due to his small size and his incredible speed. He’d given up his greatest assets for a slow and giant body, so there’s no way Lee Shin Woo wouldn’t take advantage of that, would he?\n[Heaven Defying General... Heaven Defying General...!]\nHow was he able to imitate Arema Steelworker so perfectly? Why was his little sister working with him, despite becoming an undead?\nNo, where did it all go wrong? Where did he go wrong with his calculations or his plan...!? What face lay behind his mask? Was he even really undead?\nWhat was he thinking? He couldn’t figure out his motives, and he couldn’t guess them either. Just a little while ago, he had been speaking to the Light General as Arema Steelworker himself! How exactly did he do that!?\n[Heaven Defying Generalllllllllllll!]\n\"Shut it.\"\nLee Shin Woo drew one of the 12 swords restraining the sun. The Shining Bone Sword. Once he gripped the sword, it became larger, longer, and sharper, resembling a claymore. The pressure exerted from the blade was stifling!\nHe was using the Rule of Bone and Mana Bone skills too. In addition, he used Manatization to reinforce the weapon. The Manatization skill could be used on weapons created through the Bone Armory, as they were classified as his bones.\n[Did you get even stronger in that short period of time!?]\n\"Nope. I didn’t think I’d lose you, so I didn’t go at my full strength last time. You did the same, didn’t you?\"\n[...!]\n\"I’m reflecting on it. You see, once I gained the Wild Card skill, I mistakenly thought that I always had full control of the situation. But you smashed through those delusions of mine, making me train even harder. Thanks for that, by the way.\"\nLee Shin Woo replied genuinely and simultaneously kicked off the ground. The blinding light descended upon him, but it didn’t have any effect on the two heroes, as they possessed max Light Resistance. And thus, they soared through the air, as if they were a lightning bolt.\n[Kahahk!]\nAnd so, Lee Shin Woo stabbed his claymore into the giant center of the sun, where Seagald was located.\nRotten white blood spilled from Seagald’s body; it shined for but an instant before it was evaporated by the intense heat. Lee Shin Woo kept his eyes fixed on Seagald and said.\n\"Seira, if you have any last words, then now’s the time.\"\n\"I have nothing to say.\"\n[Seira...!] Thɪs chapter is updated by NoveIＦire.net\nIt was exactly as she said. She didn’t get in his way and didn’t speak excessively. She just silently watched their battle. There were still some parts of her that weren’t all that reliable, but he was sure that she had indeed been reborn as a new person.\n\"Alright, then...\"\n[Guaaahk!?]\nThe Shining Bone Sword’s ability, Death God’s Fury (which severed all spatial and magical interferences and cut the opponent without fail), was so overpowered that it overshadowed its other skill, but it did actually have another special passive skill.\nThe special passive skill, the Death God’s Smile. While wielding the Shining Bone Sword, if the user is attacked or attacks, there is a high chance that the Shining Bone Sword will duplicate and automatically attack his foe.\nThat skill had activated. There was an extra sword piercing through Seagald’s body. And another. The claymores continued to multiply, causing the sun to eventually resemble a porcupine.\n[Heaven Defying General...! Kuaaaaaaaah!]\nBut then... Seagald’s pain and hatred doubled, burning the swords away. Had he undergone some sort of unattainable awakening in the midst of that awful pain? Surprisingly, the artificial sun’s light began to mix with his flames. And those flames even became transparent!\nThat’s right. When faced with his own death, Seagald had become able to supplement the sun’s light with his Annihilation Flame! If he was able to freely use both the sun’s light and his Annihilation Flame, then there would be no one left to stop him. Whether it be the Archmage or the Emperor himself.\n[The Intermediate Dark Shadow Element has become Lv3 and Magic has increased by 40.]\n[The Beginner Shining Flame Element has become Lv7 and Magic has increased by 10.]\n[The Intermediate Dark Flame Element has become Lv7 and Magic has increased by 20.]\nBut that wouldn’t stop Lee Shin Woo.\n[How!?]\n\"As I said, you’re way too big.\"\nSeagald attempted to hide any traces of his existence within the sun’s Annihilation Flame, but with Lee Shin Woo’s Dark Shadow, he was able to tie him down to his darkness and make his presence even clearer. The sun, which had once been so bright, now had a hideous dark spot on it.\n\"There’s no escape.\"\nAt the same time, he used his Shining and Dark Flames to devour any of the flames he couldn’t reverse. A part of those flames became Lee Shin Woo’s strength, and this time it was Seagald who was burnt.\n\"I won’t lose you this time.\"\nThe sun’s Annihilation Flame disappeared. The Shining Bone Sword multiplied again and again, piercing the artificial sun repeatedly. At this point, it was difficult to make out Seagald’s original body.\n\"Since Wild Card’s already activated.\"\nThe swords lodged within the sun’s shadow simultaneously rose upwards. He didn’t need to restrain it anymore. Once he’d countered the Annihilation Flame, this entire area became Lee Shin Woo’s domain.\n\"You’re not the only one who came prepared.\"\nThough the artificial sun had descended so far down, such that it could almost reach the floor, only darkness could be seen around it.\nWhile they fought, Jin, Lee Shin Woo, and Seira quietly but quickly dominated the mana little by little, making this area their domain... At this very moment, the ownership of this domain had been transferred to Lee Shin Woo entirely.\n\"So die. ...I always wanted to say that.\"\nThe dozen Shining Bone Swords, which rose from the darkness, were instantly suffused with a huge amount of magic. Seagald already knew what was coming, so he desperately tried using his Annihilation Flame to avoid it, but it didn’t work.\nBut what if he were to use Fire Shadow instead? If he tried that, it would just mix with Lee Shin Woo’s darkness and disappear.\n[If I die... Who will avenge our citizens!?]\n\"There’s no need. No one wants a psychopath who’s willing to damn the entire world just for some paltry revenge.\"\nSeira said sarcastically and Lee Shin Woo took a short deep breath. He asked himself if he missed anything, but he didn’t. This battle truly befitted his status as a Joker. Lee Shin Woo was satisfied with his performance.\n[If you kill me, then the sun will never shine upon the Empire ever again!]\n\"That’s ok.\"\nThe Shining Bone Swords emitted darkness simultaneously. Their slashes were absolute, their trajectory unforeseeable. And dozens of these slashes mutilated the artificial sun. Not even a speck of light or fire was left behind. It was completely gone.\n\"Since the underground doesn’t need a sun anymore.\"\nSeagald had died.\nThere was no Annihilation Flame, nor a Sword God left.\nThe first and last Anti-Skull was gone.",

He thought the stat bonuses would be pretty good... or something like that, but there was something more important than all that.\nThat he had somehow won.\n\"Hoo, I barely got him.\"\n\"Oh? It wasn’t easy?\"\nHe sighed forcefully and muttered. Jin, who’d supported him through the battle, tilted her head and asked. Lee Shin Woo just replied curtly.\n\"No matter how perfect the stage or the script is, there’s no guarantee that the play will be a success until the curtains close.\" New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on novel✶fire.net\n\"...I guess that’s true.\"\n\"And I was actually kind of worried at the end when the sun began emitting Annihilation Flame. I was lucky that his awakening had just begun since I could take care of it with my elements, but if I had made a single mistake while bluffing, then that bastard would’ve beaten me.\"\n\"I had no idea that you were engaged in such intense psychological warfare...\"\nThat’s just how perfect Lee Shin Woo’s acting had been. Of course, he’d gone a step further by appearing as Arema Steelworker and then returning to his Heaven Defying General form, confusing Seagald in the process. What’s worse, Seira had popped out of a golem, causing his entire thought process to come to a grinding halt. Thus, he was able to push Seagald into a corner.\nBluffing was necessary in a battle to the death. Showing what you don’t have, but not showing what you do have. Although Seagald’s Annihilation Flame was perfectly suited for this task, he was still pushed back by Lee Shin Woo. That was the cause of his defeat.\n\"I thought he lost for a completely different reason, so I’m absolutely speechless...\"\n\"You two, could you please be quiet?\"\nThe two, somewhat lethargic due to the pleasure and exhaustion from the battle, were scolded by Seira.\n\"I would appreciate it if you gave me some time to pray.\"\nSeira, who’d inflicted significant mental damage to Seagald, clasped her hands before the wreckage of the artificial sun and closed her eyes. There were teardrops at the edges of her eyes, befitting a true Banshee.\nTo think she’d treat him like family now of all times. Lee Shin Woo, who was absolutely flabbergasted, just snorted.\n\"Weren’t you the one that asked me to kill him ASAP?\"\n\"...Yes, I did. I still consider him my older brother, when he’s not intending to kill me or this world.\"\nTo him, that meant that ’the only good Seagald was a dead Seagald’, but he didn’t tell her that. Seira seemed to feel a sense of shame, as she didn’t pray for very long.\nSeeing that, Lee Shin Woo was about to go off to collect the loot. However, Seira quietly said...\n\"If my older brother had met you under different circumstances, would he have been alive right now like me? Would you have not had to kill him?\"\n\"Nope. There was no hope for him when his vengeance was targeted at not the Magic Emperor and his forces, but humanity as a whole.\"\n\"...I see. Thank you. That makes me feel a little better.\"\nHe could hear the bitterness in her voice, yet her expression seemed more peaceful than before. Perhaps that was a question she was asking herself, not Lee Shin Woo.\nAfter becoming a hero, she had resolved to kill her older brother herself. She hadn’t thought that she was in the right. The fact that she even had to ask Lee Shin Woo was... No, there was no point in thinking about this anymore. Seagald was dead now; the end.\n\"Good work.\"\n\"I wasn’t helpful at all. I just watched on the sidelines. ...But I’ll do my best for the remainder of the battle.\"\n\"Of course you will. You have to earn your keep.\"\nLee Shin Woo scolded Seira and stretched his hand towards the wreckage. Then, he was flooded with a string of messages.\n[Lucky Strike! You have acquired 899,550,410 Perium. The Lucky Strike skill has become Lv7!]\n[You have acquired the Lv9 Light Tinged Annihilation Flame Sword God’s Frontal Bone.]\n[You have acquired the Lv8 Annihilation Flame Sword God, Seagald Von Retadane’s Finger Bone.]\n[You have acquired the Lv9 Annihilation Flame Tinged Artificial Sun. Through Bone Reinforcement, it has been changed into the Lv9 Annihilation Flame Bone Core.]\nOriginally, Seagald would’ve dropped all of his equipment and artifacts as well, but by fusing with the artificial sun, all of said equipment had been destroyed.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo was content with this. Since he not only received two of Seagald’s bones but also received the artificial sun’s core!\n\"This is...\"\n\"So this is the sun that shone upon the Underground Empire.\"\n\"It’s very different, but yeah.\"\nSeagald’s influence had caused it to change once, and Lee Shin Woo had caused it to change a second time, resulting in the ’Annihilation Flame Bone Core’ artifact. The inside of the small bone core was illuminated by a transparent light, and its exterior was an unusual shape.\nHowever, the amount of flames it contained within were immeasurable, and it was hard for him, who possessed Lv8 High Rank Fire and Lv7 High Rank Light, to even hold it. Seeing that, Jin knew exactly what Lee Shin Woo was thinking.\n\"You want to use that on the Titan, don’t you?\"\n\"Of course I do. Kratia and I managed to cover the Titan’s weaknesses, so I thought the Titan Core was perfect. But now that I think about it, there’s something above perfection, isn’t there?\"\n\"Ah, I see. If that’s what you think, then I suppose it’s true. In your original world, that is.\"\nFirst, Lee Shin Woo very carefully stored the Annihilation Flame Bone Core into his inventory. Then, he collected the 9 million Perium from the opponent that gave him the most grief and gripped the level 8 and 9 bones in both hands.\n\"So this is purely Seagald’s and this one’s been affected by the artificial sun.\"\n\"A bone sommelier...\"\n\"Want one?\"\n\"I’ll pass. I think level 8’s enough for me.\"\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t being honest with her. He just wanted to see her reaction, as she hated Bone Reinforcement. He grinned and absorbed the level 8 finger bone first.\nAt that moment, Lee Shin Woo was afflicted with sharp pain. This would always happen whenever he absorbed a high level existence’s bone, but the bone of one who’d trained for so many years was very different!\n[Absorbing the Lv8 Annihilation Flame Sword God, Seagald Von Retadane’s Finger Bone through Bone Reinforcement. Strength has increased by 60 and Agility by 70. The High Rank Light Element has become Lv8 and Magic has increased by 20. High Rank Fire Resistance has become Lv8 and Magic has increased by 60.]\n[The High Rank Combat Sense skill has become Lv10, allowing you to see a glimpse of the realm beyond. The skill is now maxed and will have both a direct and indirect effect on your skills. Agility has increased by 140.]\n[You have learned the fusion element, Beginner Fire Shadow Lv5. Magic has increased by 50.]\n[I’m the only one who can right His Majesty’s wrongs. I will return the Empire to the surface no matter what. - Seagald Von Retadane]\nHe had a level 9 bone waiting, so his expectations hadn’t been high, but surprisingly, the bone had an abundance of power and memories within.\nSure, Lee Shin Woo was happy about his Light Element and his Fire Resistance leveling up, but he was most happy about his maxed out Combat Sense! Logically speaking, Seagald had far outstripped Lee Shin Woo in terms of basic combat abilities.\n\"Hoo...\"\nBy absorbing Seagald’s bone, Lee Shin Woo had inherited his combat abilities. Thus, his Combat Sense had risen to High Rank Lv10, maxing it out. And the change he’d undergone wasn’t the easiest thing to explain.\nOf course, it’s not like his combat abilities completely transcended Seagald’s now, but if he trained enough with these memories and experiences, then he would eventually get to where he wanted to be.\n’It really is way better to steal someone else’s abilities than to just train on my own’, he thought like a thief and turned his attention to the next skill. It was none other than Fire Shadow.\n’I was probably able to learn it as quickly as I did because of how high my fire and darkness elements are.’\nHad Seagald used Fire Shadow for a long time? No, absolutely not. He specialized in light and fire, so he only gained this ability after becoming undead and acquiring the darkness element.\nThe fact that Seagald had even obtained another innate element just by acquiring the darkness element was unbelievable, but Fire Shadow really wasn’t much compared to the Annihilation Flame. It was just that Lee Shin Woo, who’d absorbed the memories and knowledge, specialized in fire and darkness, which allowed him to learn it right off the bat.\n\"So what does that element even do? Seagald couldn’t even use it properly when he fought against you.\"\n\"This maximizes the darkness element’s ability to link people.\"\nIn a way, it was similar to Lightning Bind. But contrary to Lightning Bind, which allowed the Magic Emperor to control his subordinates from long range, Fire Shadow reflected Seagald’s desire to rush over and save his subordinates, wherever they may be.\nIn other words, it focused on protecting his forces, rather than reinforcing them directly.\n\"But it seems like Seagald didn’t understand this ability fully, even though it was his ability. As evidenced by how he made his subordinates sacrifice themselves or how he only used it as a transportation ability.\"\nLee Shin Woo looked down at the shadow cast by the flame and smiled. That shadow stretched out, touching Jin’s and then Seira’s shadow as well. They both flinched simultaneously. Whenever the fire’s shadow erupted from the ground, he could feel his connection with them deepen.\n[The Beginner Fire Shadow Element has become Lv7 and Magic has increased by 20.]\nAnd thus, Lee Shin Woo came to a conclusion. The Fire Shadow Element wasn’t a simple transportation skill; it was a wide area buff skill that affected anyone connected to him!",

    "content": "<Chapter 51. Underground’s Sun - 6>\nLee Shin Woo tested out the Fire Shadow Element several times and felt as though this element suited him more than Seagald.\nFire Shadow would connect him to his subordinates, strengthen them, and protect them... This ability, which would buff his contractees, was similar to the Lightning Bind Element, but also completely different.\n\"...It feels a bit unpleasant. It feels like you’re right beside me at all times.\"\n\"I’m testing out the ability, so bear with it.\"\n\"This is strange. It’s a buff? It feels like some unknown power is strengthening my every move.\"\n\"My fire-using subordinates will likely experience the most extreme change.\"\nWhile the Magic Emperor’s Lightning Bind specialized in controlling his subordinate’s power, Fire Shadow was the opposite; it used the user’s power to strengthen their subordinates.\nLightning Bind forcefully took control of one’s body at long-range, whereas Fire Shadow allowed the user to transport to their subordinate’s side. They were both opposite extremes.\n...The reason Seagald’s soldiers were forced to immolate themselves to summon him was all due to his inexperience with it. Seagald’s skill in the light element had far outstripped his skill in the darkness element, thus disallowing him from using the Fire Shadow Element properly.\n’...This is fun. Plus, it’s really useful. It was definitely something I needed.’\nLee Shin Woo hadn’t been able to strengthen his subordinates with the darkness element, so he was overjoyed that he’d gotten an innate element with the ability to do so.\nFire Shadow would likely strengthen his darkness as well. To be more specific, he felt as though he would find new possibilities. Like with the overlapping ability.\n\"Oh, this works?\"\nLee Shin Woo found that he could ’only’ transfer the effects of his skills or elements. With this, Lee Shin Woo could have some fun. But because Jin and Seira resented him for this, he soon stopped.\n\"If you do it again, I’ll get mad for real. I’ll cry for you. Do you understand what this means?\"\n\"Do you have any idea how much strategic value lays in this ability...\"\n\"Stop. Use it when you need that ’strategic value’.\"\n\"Yes, ma’am. I’m so sorry.\"\nAfter he’d gotten familiar with the Fire Shadow Element and raised it to Beginner Lv8, Lee Shin Woo lifted the next item. It was none other than the level 9 bone.\nWas it just him, or was there light coming from the bone? He soon realized that it wasn’t him seeing things. This bone, which had undergone a deep fusion with the artificial sun, was already part artifact. He took a deep breath and tightly gripped the bone. Then, he activated Bone Reinforcement.\n[Absorbing the Lv9 Light Tinged Annihilation Flame Sword God’s Frontal Bone through Bone Reinforcement. Strength and Agility have increased by 200, Health by 100, and Magic by 300. The High Rank Light and Fire Elements have become Lv10 and have been maxed out. Magic has increased by 480.]\nLee Shin Woo somewhat knew what to expect, as he’d absorbed the level 9 Garuda’s bone before. Yet, he was absolutely gobsmacked.\nIt wasn’t just the effect of Seagald’s bone; the abilities from the bone fused together with his own, causing him to reach a new level. He had maxed the Light and Fire Elements in one go!\n’...It’s hot! Shit, it’s really hot!’\nHe’d been looking forward to this, but the aftereffects of mastering two elements simultaneously were huge. It felt as though the bright light and the hot flames were erupting from his cells and exploding.\nWhen he’d mastered the Darkness Element, all he needed to do was feel and think about the darkness element, but this was different. The various elements asserted their existence within him and went wild. Lee Shin Woo’s mind was in a daze.\nFortunately, he had a close association with both the Fire and Light Elements. A flame-wielding swordsman appearing within the Retadane family, which had inherited the Light Element for generations, was no coincidence. Lee Shin Woo studied these two elements in-depth and then closed his eyes.\n[High Rank Fire Resistance has become Lv10 and has been maxed out. Magic has increased by 50.]\nEventually, his Fire Resistance had been maxed out as well. The element had been maxed out, so it was only natural that the resistance would follow suit.\nThen, the unpleasantness, which was akin to wearing clothes that didn’t fit, disappeared; he felt great, as though he’d just dipped into a warm hot spring.\n’Yeah, I shouldn’t overthink it. I shouldn’t separate myself from the two elements. Just like how I can become darkness and the other way around, I can become fire and light as well.’\nWhen he’d mastered the Darkness Element, Lee Shin Woo had transformed his entire body into darkness; like that time, he transformed his body into fire and light, filling the entire area with the two elements.\nWhen he became one with the darkness, he had collected it at a single point. But it was different with the fire and light elements; he switched between expanding and contracting them, as well as heating them and cooling them. Surprisingly, his Manatization skill, which had leveled up not too long ago, had leveled up once again.\n[The Manatization skill has become Lv7, and Health and Magic have increased by 20.]\n[You have reached the peak of light and darkness. You have satisfied the conditions required to fuse the two elements together. You have acquired the title, ’Chaos Spawn’. All stats have increased by 30. The power of all your elements increases by 10%.]\n\"...Hoo.\"\nUltimately, the light and fire completely disappeared and nothing remained. Then, Lee Shin Woo appeared from within the void and landed on the ground.\nThe Darkness Element is strengthened when the Light Element is maxed out. It was a natural phenomenon. Contrary to others, who geared more to one side or the other, Lee Shin Woo had chosen the right path.\n\"Have you become a god?\" Get full chapters from novel✦fire.net\n\"You’d become like this too if you max an element.\"\n\"Isn’t that what a god is?\"\n\"At first, that’s what I thought too, but I found that gods aren’t pushovers. I have no idea how they all become gods so easily.\"\nSeira asked and Lee Shin Woo teasingly replied. Then, he caught his breath. He knew that it wasn’t over yet. He’d won big, of course, but he had yet to receive Seagald’s greatest ability.\n[You have acquired the fusion element, Intermediate Annihilation Flame Lv1. Magic has increased by 100.]\nIt was the Annihilation Flame, which was both a fusion and innate element, and was created by combining the essence of both the Fire and Light Elements. Because he had mastered both the Light and Fire Elements, the Annihilation Flame started off at the intermediate level, despite it being Seagald’s innate element! Though there was still the matter of it being capped at intermediate level 10!\n’They’re fundamentally similar, but it’s also completely different from Shining Flame.’\nShining Flame was used to vaporize anything and everything. On the other hand, the Annihilation Flame was collected inside one’s body and burned one’s self.\nBut that didn’t mean that it would vaporize the user. The burnt body and soul wouldn’t be destroyed, and something else would be substituted in their place. And thus, the user would appear in a completely different state, unbeknownst to their opponent. That’s why he felt as though Seagald’s Annihilation Flame was greater than the Garuda’s Shining Flame.\n’And that’s why I had such a hard time dealing with him, but... It ultimately became my power.’\nIt was a complicated ability, so he would need to practice with it to use it to its full effect, but Lee Shin Woo was quite talented himself. When he fought against Seagald, he’d gotten a good grasp on how the Annihilation Flame worked, so if he just practiced it a little bit more, then he could truly make it his own.\n[Your Magic stat is over 10,000! You have acquired the title, ’He Who Begins to Resemble Mana’. Magic has increased by 100. Your body is saturated with a higher quantity and more powerful mana. The Manatization skill grows more quickly than before.]\nLee Shin Woo felt relieved, as he thought his body was finished with all the changes. However, another unexpected happened.\nHe’d gotten a title for passing the 1,000 Magic mark before, but apparently, there was a version of it for passing the 10,000 mark too!\nLee Shin Woo really had no way of knowing that this existed beforehand. Regardless of Kratia’s genius, or Jin’s Child of Light, their stats were nowhere near close to 10,000!\n’As expected, Manatization and this title’s goal align.’\nHonestly... He was really lucky. His priority was the Manatization skill, yet by passing the 10,000 Magic mark, his body had been transformed to be more suitable for the skill.\nHis stats, which had originally been balanced, were completely all over the place, but it didn’t really matter. Once the Joker mastered the Manatization skill, their preexisting body wouldn’t matter!\n\"A single battle caused you to change so much. Is this man always like this?\"\n\"That’s not the first time someone’s asked me that.\"\n\"Normally, one needs time to digest what has happened and will grow from it slowly, but... He grew so much all at once.\"\n\"That’s why Shin Woo got so strong in such a short period of time. Is there really any other reason besides that?\"\n\"...Ha, he truly is loved by God.\"\n’So is that the recent trend? If God loves you, she turns you into a skeleton?’ is what she wanted to say, but Jin remembered everything Lee Shin Woo had done thus far and just kept her mouth shut. It really did feel like Lee Shin Woo was loved by God.\nWhereas, Lee Shin Woo had no idea what they were talking about and was drawing out the remaining essence from Seagald’s bone. It consisted of memories of Seagald and the Archmage creating the artificial sun together, and even then, Seagald was already level 8.\n[This sun will continually shine upon the Empire, and no one will be able to drop it from the sky. One day, when we return to the surface, this sun will become unnecessary. When that time comes, I will come and collect it. - Seagald Von Retadane]\n...How ironic. Before he’d died, Seagald had said that ’if he died, then the sun will never shine upon the Empire ever again’.\nSeagald had stated that he’d collect the sun once they return to the surface... Did he keep his promise, since he assimilated with the sun, or should he say that he was indeed an undead, as he had forgotten his promise?\n’Well... Anyway, it’ll turn out exactly as you said, Seagald.’\nThere was no longer a need for the sun underground, as there would soon be a victor. By retrieving his light, Lee Shin Woo felt the Empire fill with darkness and took a deep breath.\nWith this, the Empire’s darkness would become even stronger, and anyone who had relied on the artificial sun would lose their way. The end was near. Neither side would back off now. The unavoidable final battle was approaching.\n\"...Shall we make a break for it?\"\n\"Alright.\"\nLee Shin Woo checked his Mana Radar and confirmed that the Sun Spear General, who stayed back to stop Leofield Von Tariman, was dead. He then checked that the remaining golems had accomplished their mission (of collecting the bone he left behind), nodded his head, and opened a gate.\nHis party soon disappeared from the capital. Though the underground capital, which had lost all traces of light, had regained its silence, that silence would certainly not last for very long.",

It was just a joke, but if things go well, I think I can really get to level 9.\"\n\"...What do you have to do to get your stats to rise by the thousands?\"\n\"Who knows. It just comes naturally to me.\"\nFollowing the battle, Lee Shin Woo had returned to the Metal Army base. His loyal subordinate, Erem 290, presented the Sun Spear General’s bone to him, and he then reexamined his stats.\nCompared to Seagald’s bone, the Sun Spear General’s wasn’t anything special, but it leveled up his Water Resistance and Element (which he seldom used), causing his Magic to increase significantly once more. Even if it’s rotten, it’s still a herring. Or, even if he’s just an extra, he’s still one of the Four Heavenly Commanders.\n\"But Shin Woo, are you really ok with just absorbing other’s bones all willy-nilly like that? That was a huge problem for you before.\"\n\"Mm, my shoulders hurt a little, but this much is fine. Honestly, it’s just a scam. I can just fool the world into thinking that I’m the legitimate owner of this karma.\"\n\"That’s how it works...?\"\nJin couldn’t understand him and just tilted her head, but to Lee Shin Woo it was a simple matter. It was unclear how the world perceived a ’legitimate owner’ of karma, so as long as Lee Shin Woo fooled the world into thinking he was that legitimate owner, everything would be fine.\n\"So I can just kill the Heaven Sundering General, Leofield Von Tariman.\"\n\"Is it really that simple!?\"\n\"His Dark Shadow lets him distort order.\"\nThat’s right. To put it bluntly, Lee Shin Woo was using Dark Shadow, which reversed cause-and-effect, to act like a gangster! If he’d gained this power earlier, then he would’ve acted like a swindler even earlier and plunged this world into chaos!\n\"How will you handle all that karma...?\"\n\"Think about it this way: Just put it back before you get caught!\"\n\"Stop. It sounds like you’re a high school girl sneaking out of the house in her older sister’s clothes!\"\nLee Shin Woo joked around with Jin and was greeted by Kratia. Once he was done giving her a progress report, Kratia immediately rushed outside and was mesmerized by the sunless underground night sky.\nThere had always been a slight presence of light, even during nighttime. But now that the artificial sun was gone, it was completely dark. Now, morning would never come for the underground. Like it had been when the first residents of the Underground Empire had come.\n\"...The sun’s gone. The yang energy has dwindled, but in exchange, the yin energy has gotten even stronger. ...It’s great that I’ve gotten stronger and all, but the Emperor and the Archmage probably got stronger too.\"\nLee Shin Woo knew he couldn’t have allowed the sun to remain, especially because Seagald had fused with it. ...Despite that, he couldn’t help but worry.\nHe was worried about the powerful Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin (even so, Lee Shin Woo had destroyed his physical body twice), and was especially worried about the Emperor, who he assumed to be at least level 9!\nIf those two’s darkness was further strengthened, then could Kratia even do something against them? Unlike Prince, Kratia didn’t want to be useless (as always, she was being really disrespectful towards Prince) and furrowed her brow in anguish.\nHer helping Lee Shin Woo study the Titan may have been good enough, but that wasn’t enough for her. Now that it’s come to this...\n\"I studied the Titan and gathered plenty of data. And because of you, Shin Woo, I’ve gotten a grasp on innate elements. ...Maybe it’s time for me to change too.\"\nShe’d prepared herself for this, but she hadn’t taken the plunge. So, in a way, it may have been for the best. It was better for her to throw away her pride as a magician.\nWhile she was making a huge decision, she suddenly overheard someone speak.\n\"It truly is dark. It would usually brighten around now, like the surface. ...Though I haven’t known about the surface’s brightness for very long.\"\n\"Dana?\"\nIt was Dana, once the princess of the Underground Empire, now an Immortal. She, who should’ve been in the Spirits’ Spring training with the spirits, had shown up in a one piece outfit and was heading towards her. In that short period of time, she had seemingly fully adjusted to her body, as she seemed much stronger than before.\n\"When did you get here?\"\n\"I came right over once I heard from the Hero. ...I believe the Hero was going to call me if the situation worsened.\"\nAs Seira had pointed out, Lee Shin Woo had prepared several ’cards’ for Seagald. One of those cards was the squad stationed in the Spirits’ Spring.\nBecause Lee Shin Woo had formed a contract with the Spirits’ Spring, he could create a gate to the Spirits’ Spring anytime, anywhere. Thus, he could call over more personnel (surpassing the gate’s limitation) more quickly than usual.\nDana had been prepared to jump into the fight against Seagald if necessary. But as you are well aware, Lee Shin Woo hadn’t needed Seira, let alone Dana.\n\"It... truly is dark. I’ve never seen such darkness, even when I was strapped to the Heaven Rending Cannon in Bayran. This is the first time I’ve seen such a thing... ever since I was born.\"\n\"Yeah. It’s scary since it’s so dark.\"\n\"Hoo, hoo. I’m not scared at all. Since I now know that there’s a true sun on the surface.\"\n\"...\"\nContrary to everything she’d learned, the surface was very different from what she’d expected, and she was deeply moved by what she’d seen.\nThe underground was changing so quickly due to the machinations of just one man. And regardless of how events progressed, the Underground Empire would soon meet its end.\nWhat would happen to her then? She thought about it and then smiled bitterly. She dare not think about it. After all, she hadn’t expected that she’d be sublimated into a greater existence, an Immortal. ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ Novᴇl_Fire(.)net\n’The Hero must have some sort of scenario mapped out already. Everything will go as he wishes, and I have no complaints there. On the contrary, seeing such exceptional ability from the man I love causes my heart to pound. ...But how much can I really do on his stage? Can I really help him?’\nCoincidentally, she was thinking along the same lines as Kratia. Lee Shin Woo was so talented that they felt stupid for pledging their aid.\nKratia, who had no idea what she was thinking, tilted her head at Dana, who was vacantly gazing at the sky and asked.\n\"Are you sad now that your fiance’s dead? ...Or did you want to be there when it happened?\"\n\"...Pardon? Fiance? Ah, you’re talking about Seagald. I’m not sure. I regret not being able to sock him in the face, but we weren’t close enough for me to feel sad over his passing. He was my fiance in name only... And I also have someone I love.\"\n\"You sound like the main character of a romance novel.\"\nKratia said, dumbfounded, and Dana looked askance at her and repeated.\n\"You seem to not have any dreams; it must be because you’re a magician. Most Elementalists are pure and have a wild imagination. Everyone carries a story within their hearts. It’s just that my story is a romance.\"\n\"Then what about Shin Woo? Shin Woo’s an Elementalist too.\"\n\"Mm... I heard there was a darkness magic book on the surface made of human skin.\"\nIt sounded more like a book a demon would carry around, rather than an Elementalist, but Kratia could understand completely.\n\"You can appraise someone so calmly, yet still like them, huh...\"\n\"He’s extremely cruel and not considerate of others, but he also cares for us immensely. I like him. But sometimes, I think he spoils us too much.\"\n\"I don’t really get it. His Heaven Defying General persona’s really cool, but... I think I’ll need to study love a bit more.\"\nKratia always thought he’d been the prime candidate to practice on. If he, a mere skeleton, was able to draw the affection of so many women and form such complicated relationships with them, then he would be really helpful in her understanding of love and human feelings. If Lee Shin Woo had heard her, he’d probably be really mad.\n\"Persona...?\"\n\"You were both out here?\"\n\"Oh, it’s you, Seira.\"\nDana was somewhat perplexed at Kratia’s speech, as she spoke as though she wasn’t human. But then, Seira appeared at such perfect timing. She floated over to them and then looked at the night sky, which had once occupied the two’s attention.\n\"The Empire will soon disappear without a trace. You know that, right?\"\n\"Yes, somewhat. Were you perhaps thinking about what your role was in all this, Seira?\"\n\"No. As long as the Empire perishes, I’m happy. Since it’s no time to be worrying about our methods. I don’t care if Lee Shin Woo uses me as a chess piece or puts me on his stage, so long as he destroys the Empire. ...You were thinking quite lavishly, it seems, Dana.\"\n\"...\"\nSeira wasn’t concerned with Dana’s petulance or her puffed up cheeks and just said what she wanted to say. Her attitude had changed so dramatically that it was hard to believe that just a short while ago she was praying for the dead.\n\"If you have any unfinished business on this curse-ridden world, then you should deal with it before everything ends. ...Oh my, I should get going.\"\n\"What about the Hero? It’s just you, Seira?\"\nDana’s cheeks puffed up even more. Seira, feeling her gaze, smiled as if entertained, and turned around. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo entered the chatting channel and was met with...\n[Lloyd H.K.: S-Silene is... Shin Woo, Silene’s been captured! We have to go and save him!]\n[Lee Shin Woo: Oh, no.

    "content": "<Chapter 52. War’s Scenario - 2>\n[Lloyd H.K.: Shin Woo, Silene is...!]\n[Lee Shin Woo: Senior, I get it already, so please don’t cry and take your time.]\n[Erian Ruparte: We’ve been anxious lately since Retadane disappeared, but... Lee Shin Woo. I’m sorry. You’re the one who’s suffering the most...]\n[Lee Shin Woo: No, it’s fine, so please go ahead and explain.]\nWait, why would he suffer from Seira’s death? He urged them to get to the main point whilst tilting his head. Then, Erian continued, as if she understood what he was thinking.\n[Erian Ruparte: Anyway... We’ve been really anxious lately, but all of a sudden, Silene Viesa came into the channel.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: He did, did he?]\nLee Shin Woo checked, confirming that Silene was still accessing the chatting channel. However, he wasn’t talking, likely because he was in a situation where he couldn’t.\nThat meant he wasn’t dead yet... He was really surprised since he expected Silene to be dead already, but he pretended like he wasn’t.\n’Wait a sec. This is... What is this? Ha, that’s hilarious.’\nMore importantly... He didn’t want to believe it, but he felt like something was off with the chatting channel. It wasn’t the normal chatting channel! Contrary to Lee Shin Woo, who was feeling a bit anxious, Erian calmly continued with her explanation.\n[Erian Ruparte: But I think he encountered one of the 12 Generals. I don’t know which one he met, but... I believe he’s been captured. He’s been imprisoned.]\n[Lee Shin Woo: One of the 12 Generals, huh...]\n...Lee Shin Woo thought about which of the 12 Generals it could be.\n[Lloyd H.K.: Those damn undead. To think they’d take Silene hostage...!]\n[Lee Shin Woo: I see. So he’s been captured alive. I wonder why they’ve taken such a merciful approach? How shocking...]\nIt was so obvious what was going on; Lee Shin Woo’s Acting ability couldn’t handle their stupidity and he let his insincerity slip. Erian noticed, seemingly more anxious than before, and yelled desperately.\n[Erian Ruparte: We know how shocking it must’ve been to lose Seira. However... Lee Shin Woo, we would appreciate it if you helped us. We can’t just leave him out to die! He’s your junior, someone who greatly respected you!]\nWho lost who exactly? He was shocked because of who? Their delusions had run this rampant during the time that Lee Shin Woo and Seira were out of touch...? Lee Shin Woo was astounded and remained silent, but then Lloyd continued where Erian had left off with a loud voice.\n[Lloyd H.K.: If we work together, we can take down one of the 12 Generals. We have to hurry. It’ll get even harder if he calls for reinforcements. Shin Woo... Help us.]\n[Erian Ruparte: Lee Shin Woo.]\nBoth seniors asked seriously. Lee Shin Woo closed his eyes in thought. He already knew what to say to these incorrigible idiots, but he wanted to organize his thoughts before doing so.\n[Lloyd H.K.: Shin Woo, if we work together, then we should be able to save our comrade from certain danger...]\n[Lee Shin Woo: I’m sorry, but...]\nThey were about to try persuading him once more, but then Lee Shin Woo firmly said...\n[Lee Shin Woo: I can’t go right now. I’m sorry, but it looks like you’ll have to give up on Silene. Please don’t go anywhere. ...I’m sure you already know about the underground’s sun, yes?]\n[Lloyd H.K.: Lee Shin Woo!]\nLee Shin Woo didn’t even reply and just left the chatting channel. He then checked his Mana Radar and sighed deeply. He’d hoped that he was wrong.\nThen, Seira and the rest of his party trickled in. He only called Seira, so why were all of them here? He tilted his head and asked.\n\"Seira, I want to ask you something.\"\n\"What is it?\"\n\"Can a person use the chatting channel to affect another’s mana? In other words, is it possible to use darkness mana to find the other heroes’ location or info?\"\nIn response, Seira sported a strange expression. It was as if she was saying ’I never even thought of that’. She looked straight at him and said.\n\"What’s with you all of a sudden? You know that the chatting channel is a part of God’s domain.\"\n\"Yeah. I thought so too, but I sensed darkness mana within the chatting channel. Isn’t that strange?\"\nThat’s right. That was the main source of Lee Shin Woo’s uneasiness. What’s worse, he felt an attempt at a ’forced connection’ in order to figure out his location.\nHe’d led that mana to an entirely different location, but it wouldn’t have been possible had it not been for his maxed out Darkness Element and Dark Shadow.\n\"The chatting channel is a domain comprised of God’s mana, so how could another person’s mana interfere with it? That’s extremely hard to believe... But if you sensed it, then you’re probably right. It seems like you were able to control your mana as you please within the chatting channel too.\"\nSeira was well-versed in Lee Shin Woo’s abilities. She’d felt it was strange and thought about it, furrowing her eyebrows, and then said.\n\"This has never happened before. If it did, I wasn’t aware of it.\" ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ n͟o͟v͟e͟l͟f͟i͟r͟e͟.net\n\"I could’ve asked Ethan Cruz if he were still alive.\"\n\"That really makes me feel sorry for myself.\"\nHe ignored Seira’s sarcastic remark and heard Kratia’s cautious voice.\n\"...Shin Woo, the fact that they’ve intruded upon God’s power means that...\"\n\"Yeah. If we make a mistake, then no new heroes will be summoned... So, we have to end it. I don’t think I have to worry about you two, but just in case, Jin, Kratia, don’t go into the chatting channel.\"\nWhile he was at it, he sent Prince a private message telling her not to enter the chatting channel. Fortunately, he wasn’t too late and she obeyed his warning.\n[Prince Altania: Silene Viesa? He’s already dead to me.]\n\"As expected of a veteran hero.\"\nPrince was busy exploring dungeons on the surface, so she didn’t have the time to come down and save Silene. It was quite fortunate actually. Silene Viesa was likewise already dead to Lee Shin Woo as well.\nIf Silene Viesa had brought the darkness mana within him by entering the chatting channel, then he was playing in the palm of their enemies’ hands. It was already too late to even consider saving him.\nDid Erian and Lloyd not realize this? They probably didn’t. They were unsure if they could even take down the weakest of the 12 Generals, yet they wanted to save him? It was all just hot air.\n[Prince Altania: Lloyd’ll probably trust in his abilities and try saving him himself... He’s probably cursing at us too.]\n\"I’d be happy if that’s all that happens.\"\n[Prince Altania: We weren’t originally good friends, so it’s not surprising. Still... Junior... Lloyd’s in danger, isn’t he?]\n\"...Yes.\"\nLee Shin Woo replied honestly. The battle had already begun. Their foes had succeeded in hacking into Silene’s hero abilities and were attempting to track down the other heroes, so... it didn’t matter whether the two heroes went to save him or not, they were in danger.\n\"They’re in incredible danger, as they have no way of stopping the enemy from tracking them down. Of course, they won’t be caught immediately, as they’re still quite far away.\"\n[Prince Altania: But if the Archmage himself goes, then...]\n\"...I threw them off their trail too, but it shouldn’t slow down someone skilled enough to hack into the chatting channel for very long.\"\n[Prince Altania: ...]\nPrince was dead quiet. Lee Shin Woo could easily tell how she was feeling and smiled bitterly.\n\"Why’re you being so honorable now? It’s not like you.\"\n[Prince Altania: You’re one to talk! Even I have a sense of shame, ok? I know how much you’ve helped me and I know that I’m leaving all the tough stuff to you (the fight between the surface and underground).]\nHe’s glad she knew. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and said.\n\"So what are you getting at?\"\n[Prince Altania: ...Well...Junior, can’t you save Lloyd for me? Is it too much? Is it impossible?]\n\"I can’t believe you’re actually asking me that.\"\n[Prince Altania: You told me to ask! You told me!]\n\"I’m shocked. There’s a limit to how brazen you can be.\"\n[Prince Altania: Hey!]\nIt really was fun playing around with her... Err, it was fun talking to her. He felt the stress from those idiots, Lloyd and Erian, wash away and took a deep breath. And then he said...\n\"I’ll try. Don’t hate me if it doesn’t work. Since I’ll bring you Lloyd’s bone.\"\n[Prince Altania: What’s the point of bringing me his bone!? I don’t like bones you know!?]\n\"I’m being really generous here. I guess you don’t know me that well.\"\n[Prince Altania: ...Junior.]\nDespite his small talk, Prince’s voice died down. Since she knew just what she was asking of him.\n[Prince Altania: Thanks. Aside from the bone issue... Thanks for everything.]\n\"So just relax and clear the dungeons, Senior.\"\n[Prince Altania: Don’t die. You’re not allowed to die.]\n\"I don’t die even when I’m killed, so don’t worry about me.\"\nAfter he was finished, he stood up. Everything was looking at him, but they already knew what he was going to say. If he was going now, then that meant...\n\"Total war? I really wanted to combine the Annihilation Flame Bone Core and the Titan before then.\"\n\"We haven’t practiced enough... Sseup, I guess it can’t be helped.\"\n\"Would you like me to bring the others from the surface? They’re all waiting for your order, Hero.\"\n\"I’m ready to cry whenever you need me. Crying for you is... I guess I’ll tell you at the end.\"\nThey all seemed much livelier than before, especially Seira, whose change was surprising. It was as though Seagald’s death had released her from a heart demon [1], as she acted her age now. But unfortunately...\n\"Sorry to rain on your parade, but it’s not yet time. I only called Seira, remember? Go back to work. Especially you, Kratia. I’m leaving the Titan to you.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Think about it. Why is the capital only now trying to find where the heroes are? There’s no way they’d focus on the heroes. Think about it. They’ve basically taken no damage from the heroes. They took the most damage from either Anti-Skull or the Heaven Defying General. Of course, the Heaven Defying General is actually a hero, but they don’t know that.\"\n\"Then why...?\"\n\"They’re trying to clean up. In other words, they’re trying to reduce the number of variables. Thus, the Archmage, not the Emperor has come forward.\"\nThat’s right. Lee Shin Woo had already figured out that the Archmage had messed with the chatting channel.\nHow did he do it? It was simple. He had used darkness mana within the chatting channel, so Lee Shin Woo was not only able to hide his location but could also trace the Archmage’s mana back to its source (and found Silene Viesa’s location as well), as well as locate Lloyd and Erian on the side!\n\"So I checked with the Mana Radar and ta-da! The Archmage was there.\"\n\"I see. Our enemies are trying to kill the heroes to reduce the number of unknowns.\"\n\"So, as a result, you not only figured out that the Archmage is outside of the capital, but what his motives and location are as well...?\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nSince he knew the Archmage’s plan and location, he was now in the driver’s seat. All he needed to do was wait for the right opportunity!\n\"You’re not going to save Lloyd. You’re using him to lure the Archmage out of the palace so that you can kill him... Am I right?\"\n\"Yep.\"\n\"...\"\n\"You’re... the same as ever. You don’t need to be so thorough. You don’t have to be so cautious...\"\nLee Shin Woo just shrugged his shoulders. To be honest, he had already sent his Erem brigade to the coordinates and planned to use Fire Shadow to get there when it was time. But he didn’t really need to tell them that.\n\"Then, I’ll get going.\"\n\"Didn’t you say you would wait for the right time?\"\n\"Ah, that’s not it.\"\nLee Shin Woo used one of the permits to God’s secret shop and smiled bitterly.\n\"I was just wondering if the secret shop was affected like the chatting channel. I’ll be quick.\"\n\"...The secret shop.\"\n’This’ll probably be my last trip to the secret shop’, he thought and was about to activate the permit, but then... someone grabbed onto his hand. It was none other than Seira.\nShe sported a complicated expression, but she was definitely holding onto his hand. She briefly hesitated but soon mustered up her courage.\n\"...May I come with you?\"\n[1] E/N: A thought that was weighing her down mentally.

    "content": "<Chapter 52. War’s Scenario - 3>\nHe could tell, looking at them from side to side. They were definitely sisters. The two of them looked incredibly alike and were beautiful enough to be considered the most beautiful in the Empire. So the mood between them was quite unfortunate.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\n\"G-Guten Morgen...?\"\nThe mood wasn’t all that great within the secret shop. In the midst of the two sister’s staring contest, Lee Shin Woo spoke carefully. Since Pleine wasn’t giving him her classic greeting, he had to do it.\n\"...Hello, Mr. Shin Woo.\"\nPleine twisted her head around and bowed towards Lee Shin Woo. Seira’s eyebrows twitched at ’Mr. Shin Woo’, but Lee Shin Woo ignored her and replied.\n\"If you have some things to say to each other, then I can leave.\"\n\"...No, I’m fine. I don’t really have anything to say to her. Moreover, we can’t really be called sisters anymore.\"\n\"Agreed. Now, Mr. Shin Woo, what did you come here for today?\" ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ novelfire(.)net\nLee Shin Woo looked at the two testy women and thought, ’they sure like playing around’. Who was it that begged him to save her sister again? And who was it that asked him to bring her to the secret shop again?\nThey definitely had a lot to say to each other, yet they were holding back for some reason. Lee Shin Woo had no way of figuring out why, but... if they persisted, then he’d just go about with his business.\n\"I had some questions and wanted to tell you some things too. First... I killed Seagald. Sorry, I don’t have any keepsakes to give you since they were all burned.\"\n\"I see. I already knew since I heard from Her, but thank you for telling me in person. ...In the end, you had to deal with all of our family’s problems. I’m sorry.\"\n\"...What’s with you all of a sudden? Isn’t that your specialty?\"\n\"...!\"\nAh, crap. Seira finally began talking. She just pressed something. Something more fearsome than the button for a nuclear bomb!\nLee Shin Woo briefly paused but soon decided to calm them down. Unfortunately, Seira was faster.\n\"That’s the way you deal with things. You run away, as if you’re avoiding reality, and leave all the work to other people.\"\n\"Hoh, that’s rich coming from a half-wit like you. You didn’t realize how weak you were, yet you tried to get revenge anyway. And then you lost all your comrades. In the end, you didn’t do anything right.\"\n\"I don’t want to hear that from you. You’re not willing to get your hands dirty, yet you’re willing to stand on the sidelines, selling weapons in exchange for such precious karma.\"\n’I’m not sure if she’s never gotten her hands dirty before, but at this rate, she probably will’, Lee Shin Woo thought and urgently tried to interfere, but...\n\"Hey, shouldn’t we stop this? You’ll just say things that’ll hurt each other...\"\n\"Seira, do you have any idea how I felt becoming God’s apostle? I did it so you wouldn’t have to do it! If our roles were reversed, then I would’ve killed older brother in one hit. One hit! I would’ve killed the Emperor and the likes of Seldin, and brought peace to the Empire a long time ago!\"\n\"Talk is cheap! There were rumors that you talked your way into your Saintess position. They were probably right!\"\n\"Eeeek!\"\nAh, crap. It’s all over. The two had forgotten all about Lee Shin Woo and were duking it out! The counter between them was shaking immensely!\n\"I was managing the communication between the heroes and God, as well as helping the heroes grow, while you went wild, unaware of the undead curse’s effects on you. To you, who became an undead, my job must not seem very important. I’m asking just in case, but this isn’t a specialty store that sells tea leaves. Do you understand?\"\n\"I’m so glad that you, who doesn’t even know what a real battle is, didn’t become an undead. Shall I tell you what our older brother’s last moments were like?\"\n\"Did you even land a hit on him? I believe you didn’t even cry once during the battle, even after Mr. Shin Woo turned you into a level 8 Elder Banshee.\"\n\"I did! Mentally! I just thought my intervention wasn’t necessary. You wouldn’t know how important reserve forces are since all you’re good at is yapping and picking tea leaves! Lee Shin Woo even thanked me for making things go so smoothly...\"\n\"Mentally? Pfft!\"\n\"Pfft? Pfft!? You want to spit out blood instead?\"\nWhy is it that when these two sisters met, they showed a side that he’d never seen before? And why hadn’t he noticed that black personality of theirs before...?\nLee Shin Woo watched their intensifying sibling spat, took out some popcorn he’d prepared in advance for moments like this, and sat down in a corner.\nHe’d made it since Prince wanted to eat it so badly, yet he was the first one to take a bite. Ah, this was the first time he’d made it, but it was delicious. Lee Shin Woo wanted to drink some cola with it. Then... they started to drag him into it as well.\n\"And what’s with ’Mr. Shin Woo’? ’Mr. Shin Woo’? What, are you trying to seduce a hero now too? You’re so old, so how can you be so indecent? You’re trying to be so charming to a man who was once a level 1 skeleton? Or what, is it that you’re so old now that you’ll become a skeleton yourself soon?\"\n\"Look who’s talking! It doesn’t really matter, does it? You’ve become undead now, so you transcend things like age! Moreover, what’s wrong with how I call him? You, who even at that age didn’t know how to talk to a man without hitting them with your hammer, must think that a man and woman speaking amicably means that they’re in a relationship. Sorry to say, but it’s not true!\"\n\"That’s because once I became older, all that was left were undead and monsters! Or what, did you want me to date someone like Ethan Cruz!? And in the first place, you’re the one who told me I didn’t have a chance with the other male heroes whenever I came here!\"\n\"It’s because you’re clueless when it comes to relationships! You would’ve been ruined if you dated trash like Ethan Cruz! If you’d even bothered to learn love through books, then you would’ve known that my and Mr. Shin Woo’s relationship isn’t like that... Huh? Wait, do you...\"\nWhy did Ethan Cruz have to be cursed out for something he didn’t even do? While Lee Shin Woo shook his head, Pleine alternated between him and Seira, as if she’d figured something out. Seira noticed this and spoke in disgust.\n\"There’s nothing between us. It looks like you’re the one with your head in the clouds! It must be because you’ve only learned about romance from books. I know that, as a Saintess, men would just respect you; they didn’t ever approach you!\"\n\"They did! They just weren’t good enough for me! Moreover, all the heroes tried flirting with me too! Didn’t know that did you? All of them! Everyone aside from Mr. Skeleton over there!\"\n\"I’m not a skeleton anymore, you know.\"\n’If you want to fight, then keep it to yourselves.’. He’d rather they not drag him into this, but it seemed impossible. Lee Shin Woo sighed and began boiling some water. He’d gotten quite thirsty from eating popcorn, so he decided to brew some tea that he’d bought on the surface.\n\"...Are you brewing tea here?\"\nHe thought it’d help the extremely agitated Seira relax. It worked, as expected. He didn’t think it would work, but to think it would be this easy. He smiled slightly and poured the boiling water into the teapot.\n\"You must be thirsty, so please drink a cup before you go on fighting or what not.\"\n\"Fighting? We’re not fighting. Besides, I like alcohol more than tea. Something that can wash away all this frustration of mine...\"\nHe knew she’d want alcohol instead of tea. Lee Shin Woo took out something he’d been hiding for this moment. It was a new Kerr Century Label wine bottle.\n\"Mr. Shin Woo, is that perhaps...?\"\n\"It’s our factory’s newest brandy. It’s harder to make, so we’ve only just started making it.\"\n\"Brandy! Kerr Century Label!\"\nBrandy was a generic term for any distilled fruit wine, but this brandy distilled Kerr Century’s red wine and fermented them in oak barrels.\nThe price of brandy depended on the grapes and the manufacturing process used and was a luxurious drink. On Earth, Cognac, an area in France, was renowned for their brandy. So, it was only natural that Pleine’s eyes would sparkle once he said ’brandy’.\nWhereas Seira looked speechless.\n\"...You were making that too? What exactly are you doing underground, Lee Shin Woo?\"\n\"Preparing for the future. We’ll be unemployed once we’re done with our mission as heroes. I have to prepare for my later years, don’t I?\"\n\"Preparing for your later years, huh... I anguished over whether I could defeat the Emperor or not, but you were trying to find a job...?\"\nAt first, she didn’t expect much, but her eyes widened, as Lee Shin Woo’s answer exceed any expectations she might’ve had. Whereas Pleine just gazed at him, wondering when she’d be able to taste the brandy. Pleine knew him well enough to not be surprised about him preparing for his later years.\n\"On our world, we mixed brandy and tea together. Is it the same here?\"\n\"I’m not good with alcohol...\"\n\"I just like drinking alcohol by itself, so... Ah.\"\n\"Then why don’t you try it?\"\nLee Shin Woo cruelly and boldly added the brandy to the tea, as if he had no intention of listening to them in the first place.\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo added only a small amount of brandy to Seira’s cup, so that she could smell it but not taste it. On the other hand, he dumped so much brandy into Pleine’s cup that it was more akin to brandy with the smell of tea.\n\"You’re not being considerate of the drinkers. How aggressive.\"\n\"But isn’t it strange that men like that are popular?\"\n\"I suppose that’s how it is in my older sister and Dana’s romance novels. But in real life, it’s the worst.\"\nLee Shin Woo ignored her grumbling and drank his own tea. He could smell a soft scent of brandy mixed into his tea, which really fit his taste.\nWhile they were good enough on their own, they tasted better by mixing them together. Brandy tea was a good example of this.\nLee Shin Woo was satisfied. Pleine, who sipped on her own tea, smiled and said.\n\"...It’s quite good. Is it because of the quality of the brandy?\"\n\"I still like tea as is. But it’s not bad. If I had to pick a side, I’d say I like it, but compared to regular tea it’s...\"\nShe could’ve just said she liked it. Pleine just looked at Seira and sighed. As her older sister, she couldn’t stop worrying about her.\n\"Ha. He’s too good for you.\"\n\"Hmph. I don’t want him.\"\n\"Hey, I’m right here. Don’t go giving me to other people all of a sudden.\"\nLee Shin Woo stopped their delusions and cleared his throat.\n\"Anyway... Can I ask you something now? It’s regarding the chatting channel.\"\n\"The chatting channel?\"\n[You should talk to me about that.]\nHe’d asked Pleine, but he heard someone else respond from elsewhere. Lee Shin Woo tilted his head and then, the environment changed. He saw a beautiful flower garden in full bloom as if it’d come straight out of a fairytale, along with a white table. He’d seen these things a few times before. It was God’s garden.\n[Come over here and sit. Ah, brew me some tea too. With a lot of brandy.]\n\"You could just make it yourself...\"\nLee Shin Woo was astounded, yet he pulled out a chair and sat down anyway.\nAcross from him sat that damn God, appearing before him as both an old woman and a high school girl at the same time.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 52 part4",
    "content": "<Chapter 52. War’s Scenario - 4>\nGod carefully took a sip of the tea with her thin, pale pink lips and sighed in satisfaction, as if enjoying the tea’s scent. She then said...\n[I’ll get straight to the point. This is all your fault.]\n\"That sounds like a load of bullshit, but let’s hear what you have to say.\"\nLee Shin Woo gently opened his eyes and glared at her. She pushed her red hair to one side and shrugged her shoulders.\n[It’s true. At first, I could only influence the world [1], or as you understand it, the surface and the underground together, so much. And I’ve been dividing that limited influence to summon the heroes, give them power, and develop them. Do you understand me thus far?]\n\"So why is your influence on the world limited in the first place? Gods are absolute beings, aren’t they?\"\nHe’d asked something similar before, and he was ignored back then. But he believed that now God would acknowledge him.\nGod seemingly thought to herself regarding that, and then nodded her head and spoke.\n[Yeah, I guess it’s time for you to know... If someone possessing a high ’level’, presence, or magic moves, then that’s enough to shake the world. One person’s karma changing affects other people’s karma as well.]\n\"Of course. That’s how this world works after all.\"\nThis was especially true for this world, such that he could see it with his own two eyes. Moreover, Lee Shin Woo had experienced it with his own body, hadn’t he? By switching between his form with limited immortality and his human form, he’d learned that when obtaining a terribly great karma, there was an equally heavy cost associated with it.\nAt the time, he’d thought that God was just toying with him, but that wasn’t the case. While it was a great risk, her bestowing immortality upon him was meant to reduce the side effects of bearing this kind of karma to its minimum. ...Of course, her not telling him in advance was just to mess with him.\nHowever, he understood her true intentions and nodded his head. God looked a bit moved.\n[You’re beginning to transcend humanity too. You see, most humans would be confused around now.]\n\"But that’s the essence of karma, isn’t it?\"\n[Understanding it shows the difference between a transcendent and a mortal. By forming connections with others, your karma became distorted and developed in a completely different direction, so that may be why you were able to pick up on the essence of karma so quickly.]\nGod then lowered her empty cup. She tapped on the cup and it refilled with tea. She had restored Lee Shin Woo’s special mixture of tea and brandy.\nShe gulped it down in one go and sighed. She then asked Lee Shin Woo.\n[Do you understand what I just did?]\n\"Time?\"\n[Right. It’s time. To be exact, it’s creation using Time Magic. Recreating something that is gone. It’s quite simple for me, but if used in the world, then it would be too much for it to bear and a city may vanish right then and there. That’s what karma is. And that’s the main reason why I haven’t been able to intervene so much.]\n\"Mmm.\"\nLee Shin Woo tilted his head. While Lee Shin Woo had understood the result, he couldn’t understand the process. But the result did tell him something.\nFor example, if Lee Shin Woo were to use the very same Time Magic for creation, then he was confident that he wouldn’t cause the same adverse effects. Why, you ask...? ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ novel✶fire.net\n\"Can’t you just trick it? It seems pretty simple to me.\"\n[Ah, the world. You’ve already been doing that. I’ve seen you twist order around, such that it’s unclear who the true owner of your karma is. I was really shocked. But that’s impossible for me to do. Since I can’t use that innate element.]\nIf God were both omnipotent and omniscient, then she’d be able to do everything Lee Shin Woo could do. However, she thought innate elements were special and claimed that even she could not fool the world. But if that’s the case, then why...\n\"...Are innate elements powers of the gods?\"\nYeah, he naturally came to that conclusion. Had he become a god at some point? But he soon rejected that notion, as he felt he was still lacking in several areas to be called a god.\n\"Moreover, there are way too many people in the world who wield innate elements. Aside from me, there’s the Dark Flame Ghosts, the Garuda, Seagald, the Magic Emperor... the Undead Emperor, Jissehanu, should be able to too. And based on the energy tampering with the chatting channel, the Archmage must be able to too.\"\n[Mm. They don’t become gods per se, but you could say that they’ve met the conditions to transcend karma itself. That’s actually why I’m concerned. Like you said, there have been way too many individuals with innate elements. You’re an exceptional irregular, but the events hundreds of years ago had too much of an effect... I should’ve stopped it myself, but why didn’t I? There was definitely a way to minimize the chaos and stop it. But by allowing the humans to take matters into their own hands, I ended up having to intervene more than before. I was so foolish...]\n\"...Let’s get back on topic now, shall we?\"\nAs one ages, they gain a specialty. It was talking about one thing, and then suddenly going on a tangent. Before it was too late, Lee Shin Woo slapped his cheek and spoke. Then, God went ’oh my’ and nodded her head.\n[Anyway, that’s why my influence is limited. If you were in my place, then you wouldn’t even have to worry about this and could just kill Jissehanu or Jirold yourself. Dark Shadow. That thing’s really overpowered. Remember. You may think that Annihilation Flame or what not is overpowered, but it’s not. It’s Dark Shadow. Got it?]\nGod was being jealous! While sweating buckets, Lee Shin Woo tried to steer the conversation back on track.\n\"So the surface’s Emperor is called Jirold, huh? It really suits him.\"\n[I don’t know what his public name is, but his name is definitely Jirold. But what were we talking about again? ...Ah, that’s right. First, give me another cup of tea.]\n\"You could just restore it like last time.\"\n[But it feels different. That’s karma for you.]\nPerhaps there was something he still didn’t know about karma. He poured her another cup of tea while pouting. She took it satisfyingly and returned to their original conversation.\n[I should tell you how I bestow power upon the heroes. First, the summon. I summon those fated to die in another world and send out someone dying from this world. This is the basics of summoning. It’s done to reduce the summoning’s adverse effects on the world as much as possible. And the power I bestow. I told you this at the beginning, so I don’t need to go over it again, do I? This is my ’influence’. It was all going according to plan up to here, but... the problem started afterwards.]\n\"The secret shop?\"\n[The secret shop maintains balance by accepting Perium for its goods. Of course, there were some issues with it as well, but there are some issues that can be dealt with because most of you heroes are otherworlders and not from this world. It seems like bestowing power upon otherworlders, rather than the original inhabitants of this world, has a much less adverse effect on the world. Well, what do you think? It’s quite a delicate balance, isn’t it? You get how much I love this world, right?]\n\"Then what’s the problem?\"\nWas Ms. Goddess over here always such a chatterbox? If not, then was it because of Lee Shin Woo’s actions thus far? Either way, he wouldn’t be happy, so he just urged her to continue. God continued her explanation whilst grumbling.\n[The quest rewards.]\n\"Ah, I see... Especially the 12 General quests, right?\"\n[Yep, exactly.]\nGod scratched her head as if she felt like this was a pain in the ass.\n[The reason the 12 General quests were set up that way was because I thought beating them was just that difficult and that they wouldn’t be defeated so frequently. At the time, I didn’t think a hero would show up that would kill seven of the 12 Generals by himself.]\n\"Ah, as I thought. I kind of get it. It all happened because I was too good, right?\"\n[Yeah, you bugged player.]\nIf Lee Shin Woo were to liken the situation to a game, then it would be something like ’when all the goods are pushed onto one side, then the game’s balance breaks’. With the emergence of an irregular like Lee Shin Woo, God’s delicately balanced influence broke.\n[It’s quite ironic, but the situation’s less severe than it could’ve been; all because of your Joker karma. If you didn’t have it, then the hero system would’ve failed a long time ago. You don’t seem to be aware of it, but you’ve already halfway transcended the world. Meaning you’re not recognized as one of the inhabitants of this world. Of course, that probably doesn’t matter to you.]\n\"Since I just need to trick it.\"\nLee Shin Woo replied plainly. To be honest, he already knew that. As his Joker karma grew stronger, he felt more and more isolated from this world’s rules. Even God acknowledged that as well.\nBut who cared? If he stayed on this world, then it would become his home. Lee Shin Woo was already prepared to kick back and live peacefully on this world.\n[Anyway, most of my power went to you, which made the problem even worse. Not only am I less and less able to interfere with what happens in this world, but the power I’ve already used is also starting to weaken as well. And he just happened to take advantage of this opportunity...]\n\"The Archmage.\"\n[That’s right. It would’ve been impossible with normal mana, but that bastard has learned an innate element.]\nAt first, Lee Shin Woo wasn’t 100% sure it was the Archmage that had invaded the chatting channel. Since the mana pattern he’d remembered differed from the one within the chatting channel.\nSo then why wasn’t Lee Shin Woo able to confirm that it was the Archmage, even though he was familiar with his mana? It was simple. As Lee Shin Woo had suspected, the Archmage was using some sort of mana he wasn’t familiar with... In other words, he was using an innate element!\nHe didn’t even want to think about it, but... there was a high chance that he’d awakened an innate element from his battle with Lee Shin Woo and Seagald. ’You’re just an undead, yet you’re growing!?’, thought Lee Shin Woo; though he wasn’t one to talk!\n[In any case! You can’t use the chatting channel anymore. That’s not all. The other heroes probably won’t be able to go to the secret shop anymore. He seems aware of how dangerous it would be to invade the secret shop though, as he hasn’t dared to enter, so I don’t have to worry about Pleine.]\n\"Wow.\"\n[Do you get it? I can’t summon new heroes or provide you with supplies anymore. ...Everything’s on you now. You have to do it. If you fail, then it really is the end. ...If that happens, then I’ll have to intervene and start everything anew.]\nOf course, he’d roughly expected this, but he felt somewhat odd hearing it from her. Lee Shin Woo contemplated on what she’d said and then asked.\n\"Does that mean the world will end?\"\n[...If you’re playing a game with your character, Hero AAAA, but you find you can’t beat it, then what do you do? You erase that character and try again with Hero DDDD.]\n\"Be more creative with your names.\"\n[...So I ask of you, Hero AAAA. It’s really tiring to make a new game from scratch... and it’s really sad too.]\nShe genuinely bowed before him. He couldn’t even imagine her doing this, considering how their first meeting went.\nHero AAAA... Err, Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and stood up. If he failed, he would die too. There was no need to answer her.\n\"Ah, one more question.\"\n[What is it? Oh, Pleine’s a virgin. Isn’t that hilarious?]\n\"Thanks, I really wanted to know that. No, not that.\"\n[Seira’s a virgin too.]\n\"I knew that already. So what exactly is Invisible Heart?\"\nGod’s eyes widened slightly. But she didn’t seem surprised. Perhaps she was waiting for him to ask her that. She soon narrowed her eyes and smiled.\n[Even if I were to tell you, you wouldn’t understand. But if it’s you, you may be able to figure it out by yourself soon enough.]\n\"You’re really no help at all, you old bag.\"\n[Then, take care, Lee Shin Woo. It’s been such a long time since I’ve played around with someone who could understand my ’level’. Come back and play with me again.]\nThe next moment, Lee Shin Woo had returned to the secret shop. Pleine and Seira were watching him with eyes wide open, as he’d disappeared and suddenly reappeared. He remembered what God had said and in embarrassment, turned his head around.\n\"What’s the matter, Mr. Shin Woo?\"\n\"Never mind. It’s nothing. Nothing at all.\"\nLee Shin Woo couldn’t handle the awkwardness any longer, so he was thankful that the Erems had suddenly sent him the report that he’d been waiting for.\n[1] T/N: The word she uses can mean either the world or above ground/surface in Korean. That’s why she clarifies it.",

    "content": "<Chapter 52. War’s Scenario - 5>\nThe human and elvish heroes, Lloyd and Erian, were heading towards the location of Silene Viesa’s distress signal (a level 4 danger zone and a city nearby Bayran) as fast as they could. Whilst doing so, Lloyd’s face remained tense and displeased.\n\"I can’t believe it. I thought he valued his comrades more than anyone else.\"\n\"Mm, but you can’t really blame him, Lloyd.\"\nErian, who was running beside him, just smiled bitterly. She, like Lloyd, had attempted to persuade Lee Shin Woo within the chatting channel, but she was doubtful that their rescue attempt would even work.\n\"Lee Shin Woo has the right to prioritize his life over another’s. Moreover... Do you remember, Lloyd? When he was still a rookie, Shino asked for our aid, yet we abandoned him. We also did the same with Jin Jin as well...\"\n’Jin Jin’, she muttered and felt a dull pain in her heart. Though she doubted his plan, she still ran beside him nonetheless; perhaps it was her atonement for not mustering up the courage to save Ye Jin Jin before.\n\"He learned how to be a hero from us, so... It’s the correct choice to make as a hero.\"\n\"Ugh. Still, back then... There was nothing we could do.\"\n\"I know. I couldn’t do anything either. ...And Lee Shin Woo is likely in the same position right now. He told us, didn’t he? That he can’t move right now. I don’t think he’s lying. I know because I’m an Elf.\"\n\"...Are you saying he’s right?\"\n\"It’s not a matter of right or wrong. You already know, right?\"\nLloyd’s unfriendly expression remained. Erian sighed softly so that he wouldn’t hear her.\nFollowing their extermination of two of the 12 Generals, Lloyd had been affected by Lee Shin Woo in a variety of ways, two of which being his desire to improve and an unerasable shame.\nLloyd was always hot-blooded and somewhat exhausting to deal with, but... he became even worse following that event.\n’In any case, after the events of that day, Lloyd has continued to train without taking care of himself. Because of that, I was somehow able to reach level 7 too. ...Lloyd must think that he’s stronger than Lee Shin Woo at this point.’\nIn her honest opinion, he had absolutely no chance. ’Even if 2 Lloyds were to attack him simultaneously, Lee Shin Woo would still win with ease’, she thought, but she was afraid that saying that would hurt Lloyd, so she couldn’t be honest with him.\n’But then, Silene Viesa’s distress signal came at such an auspicious time. That probably made Lloyd... remember how Lee Shin Woo had saved Jin Jin. It’s unfortunate, but Retadane died too. ...Lloyd must be thinking that Lee Shin Woo failed to save his comrade this time, so if he were to succeed with Silene, then he’d be a greater hero than Lee Shin Woo.’\nShe couldn’t help but sigh. This pointless competition, which wouldn’t allow him to be outdone by Lee Shin Woo, had caused him to make such a foolish decision.\nErian thought she may actually die this time. She hadn’t taken Lee Shin Woo’s warning lightly.\nBut what could she do? She loved the idiot. So, she’d decided to go with him, regardless of the danger... or so she thought, but then she felt her temper flare. Following him to their deaths without voicing her opposition would be nothing more than a dog’s death. And so, she stopped running.\n\"...Lloyd.\"\n\"I don’t think Lee Shin Woo was wrong either. But please understand, Erian. With how powerful we’ve become, I don’t think we can turn a blind eye to our comrades who are in danger...\" The rıghtful source is novèlfire.net\n\"Lloyd.\"\n\"Ugh...\"\nHe kept piling on the excuses, yet Erian’s calm voice stifled him. Her unyielding voice had caused him to shut up.\n\"I’m not going to talk about that anymore, Lloyd. I was against it because I thought it was too dangerous, but I came along since you were willing to stake your life on it. Since it would be better for us to die together than to let you die alone.\"\n\"Erian...?\"\n\"Do you still not get it, Lloyd?\"\nShe really didn’t know what to do with him. Erian smiled bitterly and said.\n\"I love you enough to risk my life for you.\"\n\"Huh? Huh...? Erian, you love me? Wait a sec. Huh...? You mean like, as a friend?\"\n\"You really think I can’t differentiate between the two? I’m not you. The love that all our parents shared; I’m talking about that love. You understand, right? Right?\"\n\"Hey, I know I’m dull and all, but that kind of hurts...\"\nLloyd’s face reddened instantly. He hesitated and was unable to reply; truly a trait befitting a hero. But Erian sighed in relief, as she had avoided the worst situation; after all, Lloyd hadn’t said something like, ’I don’t think this is the time for jokes’ and rejected her.\n\"I’m afraid of dying without telling you my feelings, so I’m telling them to you now. You don’t need to answer me right away, so let’s get going. Let’s go. We have to go save Silene.\"\n\"...I-I got it. Yeah, we have to rescue him. No matter what.\"\nAnd so, Lloyd began running once more, albeit awkwardly. Erian stuck closer to him and just smiled.\nIt was so easy, so why hadn’t she done it all this time? She almost felt as stupid as Lloyd. ’Then again, that’s why we get along so well’, she thought and smiled softly once more.\nUnfortunately, her smile didn’t last long. They went through the city and entered the facility where Silene was trapped, but suddenly, their body and minds tensed up.\n[Tch. So only you two showed up, huh?]\n\"Y-You’re... the Lich!\"\n[Gu...Gahahk...!]\nThey had anticipated some traps, but they didn’t know what types of traps there would be, as well as who would be waiting for them. And the person waiting for them far exceeded their expectations.\n[Lv8 Archmage Feotane Von Seldin]\nTo think... the level 8 Lich was awaiting them.\n[Gu...oooh...]\n[Kihii...]\n\"What... What the hell is this?\"\n\"S-Senior. Why are you here...?\"\nThey hadn’t expected him to be waiting for them, with dozens of high rank undead at that... no, undead heroes.\n\"Senior... Even our great seniors who we’ve only heard stories about. Why? Why are you all here...?\"\nThere was no way they could’ve expected this. The Lich had known about the heroes long ago and collected the heroes that had died within the Empire...!\n[Now that I think about it, one of you was quite sharp... But he must not have known that I was tracking you as well. With my new power that connects space through darkness, Dark Space!]\n\"D-Dark Space...? What are you talking about!?\"\n[As I thought, you don’t know. It just means that that lucky fellow will soon become like you.]\nThe Lich was delighted, as he’d finally obtained an innate element, something he’d never achieved in the past. However, Lloyd and Erian couldn’t understand him, as they didn’t even know what an innate element was. The Lich just clicked his tongue at their reaction and extended both hands.\n[Now, come over here. Don’t worry, I’ll try and keep you intact. Since you’ll soon be a part of our Imperial Army!]\n[Kihik, undead... Undead...!]\n\"Keuk, Silene...!\"\nSilene Viesa, who’d baited them here, had become an undead as well. The undead curse had affected him in the worst way possible; although he had become an undead, he still hated the undead, so he was trying to strangle himself.\nHowever, an undead wouldn’t go down from just strangling them. So he, who had lost his life to the Archmage and was imprisoned here, just rolled on the floor, continuously trying to end his life despite being unable to.\nIt wasn’t enough to call the sight ’horrid’. It was much, much worse.\n\"Why... Why did you kill Silene...!? What did he do wrong...!?\"\n[That’s just junk. To think he couldn’t even accept his new life and tried to end it. How could he be so foolish? He was quite skilled, so I recruited him into the Imperial Army, but if he keeps making such a fuss, then I have no choice but to leave him behind. Now then, I have high hopes for the two of you.]\nThe Lich, unable to conceal his excitement, continued.\n[To think your first reaction upon seeing this many undead was ’senior’. I’m astounded. You consider them heroes, not undead, I see. It’s proof that you’ve ’overcome’ the curse like us. I don’t doubt that you’ll be able to accept reality, even after becoming undead like us!]\n\"Mm...!?\"\nHearing that, Lloyd understood. Even if they were previously his seniors, the first emotion that should’ve come to mind was ’hatred’. This was the effect of the undead curse, something that even the heroes couldn’t avoid. Then why...?\n’Perhaps... Perhaps it’s because I met Shino that one time...’\nWhat did he think back then? When he saw Shino Rendu rush into the fray to save his comrades, despite becoming an undead, was the first thing he thought of killing him?\nNo, it wasn’t. He’d said that he was happy to see him, that it was unfortunate that this had happened to him, and that despite everything, he was thankful... That’s what he’d thought back then. Yeah, now that he thought about it, that’s when everything changed.\nBut did he reject those feelings...? Nope, not at all! On the contrary, those feelings were natural! It was only natural for a human to feel that way. It didn’t matter whether they were an undead or not!\n\"It doesn’t matter to me if they’re undead or not.\"\nThe hero, Lloyd H.K., gritted his teeth and gripped his sword. The approaching senior... the level 6 undead hero that he’d met just once several years ago, was cut down and he then declared.\n\"They were all heroes with such noble souls. I’m not cutting them down because they’re undead; I’m putting them to peace so that their wills aren’t defiled any longer. And you, Lich. I’m not...\"\n[Not going to what?]\nThe Lich, seemingly interested, brandished his staff and intensified the darkness surrounding the undead heroes. Though he faced a power akin to a Necromancer’s, Lloyd didn’t back down. Seeing that, Erian followed suit, gritting her teeth and raising her bow.\n\"Going to forgive you. I swear I’ll kill you. In place of all the heroes you’ve killed!\"\n[Hahahaha. Truly a response befitting one of God’s heroes! I think I’ve heard that same line... about ten times now.]\nThe Lich laughed in excitement and Lloyd merely gritted his teeth. Though he’d said all that, he was getting pushed back bit by bit by the wave of undead heroes. It was unavoidable; the more confident you sounded, the weaker you appeared!\n\"Seniors...! I’m sorry. I promise I’ll avenge you...!\"\n[Can’t you say something original? Every word you say is so cliche that I can’t take it. Are all heroes as frustrating as you? Is that it?]\n\"Entry number 2, Lee Shin Woo. I’ll try coming up with something original.\"\nThen... the Lich, who was floating in the air, heard a voice coming from behind him.\n\"Hi, the name’s Lee Shin Woo. I’m right behind you.\"\nNone of the undead had sensed him. Even Erian, with her astute senses, couldn’t sense him, nor could Lloyd. And even the Archmage...\n[W-What...]\n\"I don’t have a heart, so... let’s trying breaking yours.\"\nThis man, who’d managed to fool the ’super mode’ Lich, was obviously Lee Shin Woo, who’d come after finishing his preparations.\n\"How about it? Original enough for you?\"\nIn one hand, he gripped a crystal shrouded in deep darkness, and in the other, he gripped the Death God’s Shining Bone Sword and winked... And the Archmage screamed.\n[Aieeeeeeh! My heart! How do you have that!?]\nHe’s the one who wanted them to come up with something, so he couldn’t help but be disappointed by the Archmage’s reaction.\nLee Shin Woo snorted and raised the dark red crystal. It was quite the appetizing crystal, which contained the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin’s soul.",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 52 part6",
    "content": "<Chapter 52. War’s Scenario - 6>\nOnce Lee Shin Woo had realized that the Lich had invaded the chatting channel, he had first split the Erems into ’two squads’ and mobilized them.\n[We’ve found him, Master.]\n\"As I expected. Hurray for the Mana Radar.\"\nFirst was the area where Silene and the Archmage were located. It was a small city situated near the level 4 danger zone, Bayran. He sent the Erems, satisfying the condition for Fire Shadow, and then waited for the right moment.\nHe could, of course, defeat the Archmage without all this preparation. An innate element? Lee Shin Woo knew, as someone who often used innate elements, that someone who’d just awakened an innate element couldn’t contend with someone who possessed five.\nIf the Archmage had simultaneously reached level 9 as well, then it would be a different story. However, he wasn’t there yet. Not at all.\n[But security is strict.]\n\"Ok, I’ll go personally.\"\nThen why had he sent the Erems ahead of him? This could be explained by the second preceding battle.\nLee Shin Woo and Seagald were ahead in terms of pure power, and the Archmage’s space element had been sealed, leading to his head being split apart. However, he was a Lich, a being that could revive itself several times. As long as his life vessel remains intact, he could regain his physical body and revive himself any number of times.\nThis was really a case of the pot calling the kettle black, as he possessed a revival ability of his own (Invisible Heart), but it was so cowardly! If Lee Shin Woo just went and killed him, then it’d be such a waste of a good opportunity; the Lich was outside of the capital, but if he killed him, then he’d just revive himself!\n[Please be careful, Master. They are powerful.]\n\"They won’t be able to notice me. Don’t worry.\"\nLee Shin Woo had split the Erems into two, sending the other squad ’to a different location’. Where, you ask...?\n[Security’s tight. It’s perfect.]\n[The Lord Archmage commanded us to be wary of Seagald Von Retadane’s mana response.]\n[With this artifact, the ’Anti-Skull Mana Detector’, which was personally created by the Archmage himself, we should be able to find him, even if he completely erases his presence and reappears!]\nHe had sent them to a secret facility within the capital which housed the container for the Archmage’s soul, or life vessel.\n’I thought he was an idiot, like any undead, for leaving the capital, but it looks like he’s not. But to think they’ve created an artifact specifically for Seagald. It seems like they really were worried about him. ...Though I’m not sure if that thing can actually detect the Annihilation Flame or not.’\nThe Mana Radar’s top priority was to locate the Archmage and the Emperor’s life vessel. And once he’d created the Mana Radar, he checked the locations of their life vessels, but it’s not like he could be like... ’let’s go destroy their souls now!’.\nThe Archmage’s life vessel was stored in an extremely vital building within the capital, and Seldin would stay around it when he had nothing better to do. On the other hand, the Emperor’s life vessel was located in the deepest part of the palace. In other words, it was near impossible for anyone to steal their life vessels undetected!\n’If I didn’t have Annihilation Flame, that is...’\nAt first, he thought he had no other option but to fight head-on and destroy the Archmage’s life vessel before he had a chance to recover. In terms of destroying the life vessel, charging headfirst or fighting them head-on wasn’t much different.\nBut with Seagald’s Annihilation Flame, he had another option. It was unlikely to work with the Emperor’s life vessel, but he was confident that he could steal the Archmage’s life vessel in his absence!\n’Why didn’t the Archmage hide his life vessel in the palace too?’\nHe thought of several reasons. One, the Archmage wasn’t entirely loyal to the Emperor, or two, it could be dangerous to store two life vessels in the same location... If it was neither of the two, then perhaps two life vessels couldn’t be placed near each other.\n’From what I’m seeing, that seems like the most likely option here.’\nThis black crystal, which was protected by countless undead, shook its surroundings and emitted an uncanny energy. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo nodded his head.\nHe’d always been curious as to how a life vessel was made, but he could make a guess after looking at it. It mostly consisted of the space and darkness elements, as well as layers upon layers of unknown magic. The life vessel required careful storage and another life vessel couldn’t be placed in its direct vicinity.\n’And it looks like that crystal took a piece of the source of darkness too... That’s what comes from just taking a little bit of it? If that’s the case, then what exactly is the darkness that lay beneath the palace... Hey, wait a sec.’\nLee Shin Woo thought, but then tilted his head. The source of darkness was beneath the palace. And the Emperor’s life vessel was beneath the palace as well.\nIf that’s the case, then... did that damn Emperor use the source of darkness itself as his life vessel!? When he actually saw the Archmage’s life vessel, what had once seemed a delusion had turned out to be a reality!\n’Hey, that means that killing the Emperor and purifying the Empire are one in the same.’\nIt didn’t matter anyway; in the end, he needed to do both. Lee Shin Woo thought about the steep obstacle he’d have to face within the palace and sighed deeply. He soon refocused on his current situation.\nIf he wasted anymore time here then Lloyd and Erian would die. Honestly, he really didn’t care what happened to them, but he didn’t really want to see Prince cry.\n’First, let’s make a backup.’\nThe Archmage’s life vessel was stored very carefully; just because he’d found the life vessel didn’t mean that it was smooth sailing from now on.\nNot only were several level 7 elite undead standing guard (though many of them had been annihilated by Lee Shin Woo’s light blast), but there were also dozens of space-type traps that activated upon the entrance of an intruder. And by touching the life vessel, several more traps would activate. Lastly, once the life vessel disappeared, another trap would be activated.\nAnd even with all that, the Archmage usually remained close to his life vessel, so he really was careful.\n[The Intermediate Annihilation Flame Element has become Lv2 and Magic has increased by 20.]\n’I’m good, except for that last trap.’\nBut Lee Shin Woo’s power, or more specifically, Annihilation Flame, allowed him to ignore most of the traps. By erasing his presence, the traps didn’t have anyone to target.\nThere was an error in the activation process, so the traps didn’t even activate. It was simple.\n’...Good. I switched it out!’\nAs for the final trap, which activated upon the life vessel’s disappearance, Lee Shin Woo switched the real life vessel with a fake created with his Disguise skill, preventing the trap from triggering.\nIn the short period of time in which he switched the two, Lee Shin Woo had also used his Shining Flame on the magic circle (which made up the trap), and erased cause-and-effect. And by adding in his Acting skill, he was able to do it with ease!\nThough he was forced to use a significant amount of mana for this brief distortion, Lee Shin Woo’s level wasn’t just for show! He was able to replace the real life vessel with a fake one before his mana bottomed out.\n’The fake won’t last for very long.’\nBut it didn’t need to last that long. He had the Archmage’s life vessel in his grasp and planned to go straight to the Archmage with it in tow.\n[Artifact, all clear.]\n[Treasure, all clear.]\n[I want to fight.]\n[I want to eat meat.]\nHe took a peek at the undead, who stood guard without even knowing what he’d done, grinned, and left the facility.\n’Annihilation Flame’s totally overpowered. It seems better than Dark Shadow.’\nHe sent a message to the other Erem and then activated Fire Shadow, allowing him to instantaneously travel to a far off location... where the Archmage was oppressing the heroes.\nWith a single glance, he saw his seniors, the undead heroes he hadn’t killed yet, with his juniors, as well as the Archmage, who looked down at them in satisfaction from midair.\nLee Shin Woo felt he’d hit his limit with Annihilation Flame, so he chose to reveal himself then and there. His intro had enough impact to cause the Archmage to freeze completely!\n\"And time begins to move once more...\"\n[H-How? How do you have my heart!?]\n\"That’s not what’s important. The fact is that I have your heart in my hands.\"\nLee Shin Woo smiled at the Archmage and squeezed the crystal. But surprisingly, the once frantic Archmage had regained his composure. ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ novᴇlfire.net\n[But you didn’t break it. You came all this way and brought it to me without breaking it.]\n\"Hoh.\"\nAt that moment, Lee Shin Woo was truly surprised. Lee Shin Woo could tell that the Lich was trying to use his mana on the life vessel.\nIt was the space element. He was using the fusion element of darkness and space, the Dark Space element, on the crystal. The power of space flowed through the darkness; an element that allowed him unlimited control over anything consisting of darkness... It was truly a formidable ability. Especially when he considered that it was difficult to use the space element effectively against another level 9.\nWhile this could be replicated with a maxed out darkness element, Dark Space set itself apart; the darkness encroached space, and the ability to control said space was maximized. Perhaps Dark Space was the element most compatible with the darkness element.\n[Your biggest mistake was your arrogance. You should’ve known that I’d have awakened a new power upon seeing yours!]\n\"Oooooh!\"\nThe life vessel was already in the Lich’s hand! Lee Shin Woo was astonished and applauded him. The next moment, a black flame ignited over the Archmage’s palm. Now, the life vessel had returned to Lee Shin Woo’s hand.\nIt was quite obvious, but he had used his maxed out darkness element, Dark Shadow, and Dark Flame together. Of course, the Archmage didn’t really understand what had happened. Regardless of how great his innate element was, there was no way that he could overcome Lee Shin Woo, who possessed five of them...!\n[...?]\n\"It was nice. I’ll give you an 8.\"\nDarkness blazed upon his palm and devoured the life vessel. The reason he hadn’t destroyed the life vessel and come straight here was because of the off chance that the Lich would explode, taking Lloyd and Erian with him.\n[Fully destroying and absorbing the Lv8 Archmage Feotane Von Seldin’s Life Vessel through Bone Reinforcement. You have completely absorbed the magic source, and Magic has increased by 230.]\n[The soul is returning to its owner.]\nOnce all traces of the life vessel disappeared, Lee Shin Woo felt a full amount of mana welling with him. It wasn’t like Lee Shin Woo’s mana, which he’d acquired through Bone Reinforcement or through adapting to his circumstances, but purely the Archmage’s own mana, one who’d followed the path of a magician his entire life. He couldn’t even begin to describe the satisfaction and the joy he felt!\n\"Ah, I guess I can’t take in an entire soul, even with my abilities.\"\n[G-Gugaaaaaahk!]\nWith the life vessel’s destruction, the Archmage’s soul was forcefully ejected and returned to him. However, the Archmage wasn’t able to withstand the pain. He screamed and started rolling around in the air.\nHe’d lost control of his mana and spread it out everywhere, but it was all stained by Lee Shin Woo’s darkness and eliminated. Destroying his life vessel, the return of his soul, as well as the Lich’s anguish from its return were... all great experiences in killing Liches. It would help when he killed the Emperor!\n\"You made one mistake, Lich.\"\n[Guaaaaaah!]\nLee Shin Woo quickly stabbed the Lich with the Death God’s Shining Bone Sword and then said with a somber expression.\n\"You met me.\"\nWhile the Archmage’s magic was high, his actual defensive capabilities were quite low, so the Shining Bone Sword cut him to pieces.\nFortunately, his bone showed up properly this time.",

    "content": "<Chapter 52. War’s Scenario - 7>\n[You have hunted a member of the 12 Generals, the Lv8 Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin! All contributing heroes receive 50,000,000 Perium, and all stats increased by 100. You have acquired 15 permits to God’s secret shop. Proficiency in all combat-related skills has increased significantly!]\n[You have received God’s grace. The Invisible Heart skill’s maximum level has increased by 15.]\n[The Beginner Shining Flame Element has become Lv8 and Magic has increased by 10.]\n[The High Rank Assimilation skill has become Lv9, and Agility and Magic have increased by 30.]\n[You have given a Lich, one who defies natural order and lives with an imperfect soul, eternal rest. You have acquired the title, ’Immortal Hunter’. All stats have increased by 40. The Rebellion skill has become Lv9 and all stats have increased by 20. Whenever the conditions for the Rebellion skill are met, all stats temporarily increase by 27%.]\nNow, even if he killed one of the 12 Generals, his combat skills wouldn’t level very quickly. That’s because most of his skills were high level already. With his High Rank Assimilation skill reaching level 9, most of his skills were level 9 now.\nIt felt like it’d evolve once it reached level 10, but getting there was the problem. At the very least, he realized that he couldn’t reach level 10 with God’s rewards anymore. He was disappointed, but he was also happy about his stat growth.\n’Killing one of the 12 Generals increases all my stats by 100, and with the new title and the Rebellion skill, all my stats increase by an additional 60 a piece... So, my total stats are 24,553. The title’s amazing, but Rebellion’s quite surprising as well.’\nTo be honest, Lee Shin Woo hadn’t put much interest in the Rebellion skill, as it required him fulfilling two of its conditions before he overcame a level difference of one. However, this skill would grow whenever he performed some great feat, and before he knew it, it was already level 9.\nWhenever he met one of the skill’s conditions, his stats would increase by 27%. If he met two of them, then his stats would increase by 54% instead. Just using the Titan would meet one of Rebellion’s conditions, and fighting a huge army would meet another, so just those two conditions would increase his stats by a whopping 54%...\nIf he took into account his stats, which were at the cusp of level 9, as well as the Titan, he felt like he could really take a level 9 opponent head-on. Not a weakened opponent like the Garuda, but someone like the Magic or Undead Emperors!\n...But the problem was that the Lich’s loot was nothing to write home about.\n[You have acquired 541,609,990 Perium.]\n[You have acquired the Lv8 Archmage Feotane Von Seldin’s Parietal Bone.]\n’Tch, I guess I’ve been too lucky lately. It’s right before the final battle, yet he only drops one bone. If he dropped two, then I might’ve hit level 9, but... Meh, I’ll absorb the bone later. I have something more important to do.’\nHe had something more important to do? Obviously, it was reforming his undead seniors.\n\"L-Lee Shin Woo...?\"\n\"How did you... No, more importantly, how did you manage to kill the Archmage?\"\n\"I’ll tell you later. We have to deal with our seniors. Ah, my junior’s there too, huh.\"\nLee Shin Woo ignored both Lloyd and Erian, who stared at him dumbfoundedly, and turned his attention to his undead seniors.\nThey, like Lloyd, stood vacantly, but unlike him, they stood still because their master had died.\n[Gu...ooh...!]\n[The Lich... The Lich...]\n\"Looks like some of them are dead already. That’s too bad. Hope we meet in our next life... Anyway, everyone. Do you guys remember? Who killed you and who you need to kill?\"\n[Keuk. Kuhaahk...!]\nIn the past, he’d tried desperately to persuade his undead seniors with dramatic flair, but that was unnecessary. Lee Shin Woo spoke naturally as if he were speaking to a friend, yet his neither-soft-yet-loud voice resounded throughout the area, such that the undead could all hear him.\n\"You all remember, right? It’s too much of a waste to die here. Hating yourselves for becoming undead is proof of your ambition and your intelligence.\"\n[A-Ambition...]\n[Intelligence... My intellect... Yeah, I’m a hero...]\n\"That’s right. You’re a hero, hand-picked by God herself. You’re not going to stay here and rot whilst attacking your juniors, are you? Right?\"\n[I am...!]\nNo matter what rubbish came out of his mouth, the undead heard whatever they wanted to hear.\nLee Shin Woo didn’t adjust his speech for them; on the contrary, they adjusted his speech themselves. This was neither the power of Acting nor Instigate; it was on the level of magic at this point.\n\"What are you doing, Lee Shin Woo?\"\n\"What the...? The undead are...\"\nLloyd, who was unaware of his darkness element, or the Acting and Instigate skills, realized that there was an extraordinary amount of power within his words. But still, wasn’t conversing with the undead a bit too much?\nHis seniors had already become undead, beings which shouldn’t exist, yet instead of giving them a pain free death or a peaceful rest, Lee Shin Woo was tormenting them even further.\n\"Open your eyes. Your enemy isn’t here. Do you want to die unavenged, or do you want to continue struggling? That’s up to you.\"\n\"Hey, Lee Shin Woo...\"\n\"Lloyd, stop.\"\nEver since Lee Shin Woo had arrived, so many strange things had happened; not only had the Archmage died, but the undead had stopped. But he still needed to stop him...! or so he thought, but when he tried to step forward, Erian stopped him.\n\"Erian?\"\n\"Just sit still, Lloyd. Doesn’t it look like they’re paying attention to him?\"\n\"Yeah, it looks that way, but what’s your point?\"\n\"It seems like he’s trying to persuade them.\"\n\"Persuade the undead?\"\n\"No, our seniors who met an unfortunate demise. Didn’t you say so before? That they’re not undead, but our seniors! I think so too!\"\n\"...\"\nIn the past, he would never have been able to see them that way. The undead were the undead, end of story. And they were also beings that must be defeated.\nHe wasn’t entirely sure if Shino Rendu was the catalyst, but the undead heroes were capable of reverting to their original forms, and Lloyd had become able to acknowledge them because of it. If that’s the case, then... he would have to acknowledge their newfound potential.\n\"They’ll... fight on our (the heroes’) side again? Can he really do it?\"\n\"Yes, like Shino Rendu.\"\n\"Shino Rendu’s not on our side. He fights for the Heaven Defying General.\"\n\"He himself told us that the Heaven Defying General’s on our side. Perhaps he was once a hero?\"\n\"T-There’s absolutely no way...\"\n’They’re not completely off the mark. Though I wasn’t once a hero, but am still one now,’ Lee Shin Woo whispered in a corner, and only inwardly replied to his seniors, who were undergoing an identity crisis. Thıs text ıs hosted at novel•ﬁre.net\nIn the past, he wasn’t able to persuade all of his seniors. But since then, his Acting and Instigate skills had grown by leaps and bounds, as well as him acquiring several innate elements related to cause-and-effect. Plus, he had the Wild Card skill now too, which combined the power of all those skills together and allowed him to manipulate a situation to his liking, so now he could...!\n\"I’ll bring you to your true enemy! Open your eyes. Fight them! We have to put an end to the undead curse. That’s your final duty as one of the heroes!\"\n[Ahhh...!]\n\"Silene, you don’t need to suffer anymore. You don’t need to hate every undead anymore. Don’t let the curse consume you. Now’s the time for you to control the curse.\"\n[Senior Lee Shin Woo...!]\n\"Now’s the time. You’ve all been waiting for so long. Now! We’ll bring peace to the Underground ourselves!\"\n[Keuk. Kuooooooh!]\nAt that moment, the darkness that had been welling inside him spread throughout the clearing. The darkness, which felt incredibly warm, completely covered the undead heroes. Silene Viesa, who had continued strangling himself, had, at some point, sported a relaxed expression and was letting the darkness do as it willed.\n\"The final battle is near. Heroes, return as heroes once more!\"\nA considerable amount of darkness filled the clearing, which was then sucked into the undead heroes. Lloyd and Erian shook while watching, and one of the undead raised their heads with an incomparably clean appearance.\n[You’re right. Though I retained my intellect, I had forgotten my purpose for so many years. I can completely remember being violated by that Lich day by day!]\nThe undead hero’s once rotting flesh had become indistinguishable from human skin and appeared to him as a middle-aged man. His tattered leather armor was dyed in black and shined brighter than new clothes.\n[I have a goal: to be acknowledged as a hero, strike down evil, and return goodness to this land! Even I, who had been killed by the Empire’s undead, have a goal!]\nSoon, another stood opposite from him. She, who was once a Ghoul, had regained her beautiful appearance. Her once tattered white robes were pressed by the crisp darkness, turning them into black robes which covered her entire body.\n[Ah. I no longer hate myself or the living. I finally realize that I was trapped in a delusion, ever since I became an undead. I’ve been completely freed from the curse! I thank you junior, you, who possesses such an astounding power. You, who possesses the ability to set the darkness right!]\nAnother undead hero, who just a short while ago had rampaged about whilst carrying a scythe as tall as he was and whose appearance was indistinguishable, had been restored by Lee Shin Woo’s darkness. He had returned to being a lively, elvish young man.\n[Kuheuk, Senior... Senior...! I-I am... Senior!]\nBecause he remembered everything that had occurred, tears flowed from his eyes. The young man no longer hated himself.\n\"Silene. How’s it feel becoming an undead? It’s not much different, is it?\"\n[Senior...]\nLee Shin Woo jokingly winked at him and raised a hand. His hand, which had clearly been human, had instantaneously turned to bone and clacked.\n\"Your appearance doesn’t matter. You can always change it. What does matter is what’s inside. Silene, what’s inside you?\"\n[I...]\nSilene Viesa, who’d returned to life, looked down at his hands. As he was once a boxer, his hands were once covered with blisters and cuts. But now, he had been reformed and his hands were completely clean. They were only slightly, very slightly pale.\nBut the power within them... He was much more powerful than before.\n[I have... hatred inside me.]\nSilene tightened his fists and replied. Within those lively, human-looking eyes of his blazed a blue goblin fire, which proved what he was.\n[Hatred towards those who made me like this. Hatred towards my once foolish self. Hatred towards reality itself! Hatred towards the Undead Empire!]\n\"Good. Hatred is one of our most important emotions, one that proves that we’re alive. It’s fine to have, so long as you direct it in the proper place.\"\nLee Shin Woo confirmed that he’d reformed all 27 undead heroes (six level 7s, fourteen level 6s, and seven level 5s) and smiled in satisfaction. He then looked at the level 6 Avenger, who gazed upon him with blazing goblin fire, and declared.\n\"Let’s go, Silene. I’ve prepared the perfect stage for you to unleash your anger.\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 52. War’s Scenario - 8>\n\"Now then, the vanguard’s up front. Come up if you want to. You and you stay in the back, you go up front...\"\n\"Lee Shin Woo, you’re...\"\nLee Shin Woo gathered the 27 new undead heroes and began forming a squad out of them. Seeing that, Erian realized one thing: the skeleton hand he’d shown earlier, perhaps that was...\n\"Are you actually the Heaven Defying General?\"\n\"Erian, that’s ridiculous. There’s no way he’s...\"\n\"Bingo.\"\n\"What!?\"\nHe figured that by coming to rescue them, his identity would be exposed. After all, it was far too late in the game to be worried about that.\nHowever... before coming here, he’d thought, ’their reactions will be a pain’, but looking at them now, that didn’t seem all that true.\n\"Y-You’re the Heaven Defying General...?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nLee Shin Woo quickly affirmed, and Lloyd gaped. Lee Shin Woo grinned and briefly switched his face to that of an undead, and then switched back. Lloyd’s mouth had widened so much that it seemed like his jaw and the roof of his mouth would separate.\n\"As I thought... If that’s the case, then everything makes sense. If I hadn’t seen your undead transformation just now, then I wouldn’t have been sure. Did you always have the ability to transform into an undead? If not, then...\"\n\"It’s the opposite. I’m an undead, but I can transform into a human. Well, my human form is perfect, so there’s not much difference either way.\"\n\"How? No, why...? Why did you...?\"\nWhile Erian seemed to get the gist of things, Lloyd was still confused. Lloyd’s expression reminded him of Prince, causing him to grin. He then turned around and said.\n\"Now then, there’s a lot I have to tell you. Please follow me.\"\nWithout an ounce of hesitation, Lee Shin Woo led the 27 undead heroes, as well as Lloyd, who couldn’t accept reality and was tottering around, and Erian to his base.\nAnd thus, Lee Shin Woo had unified the remaining heroes underground, undead or otherwise. Objectively speaking, their forces surpassed the Imperial Army’s. ...Perhaps the disparity between their forces was wider than he thought.\n\"Ha, so we were the only ones out of the loop. I feel stupid for suffering.\"\n\"I didn’t keep it secret on purpose. Rather, I only told those who were in the same area as me. ...There was the case with Seira too.\"\n\"I know what you’re trying to say. Could you not look at me like that? How long are you going to use that (past events) against me?\"\nIt inevitably took longer to convince them than Prince. But upon meeting Kratia, as well as Seira, the Banshee, they had no choice but to nod their heads.\nHumans were quite simple; even if an individual didn’t agree with something, if the majority agreed, then the individual tended to accept the majority’s viewpoint.\n\"Even Prince... If she acknowledged you, then I should too.\"\n\"So what’s your relationship with Prince anyway, Senior Lloyd?\"\n\"All I know is that the two of them think of their relationship differently.\"\n\"What!?\"\nLloyd, who’d even gone so far as to send a private message to Prince, was forced to accept the cold, hard truth. Regardless of whether Lee Shin Woo was a good guy or an evil bastard, it was because of him that they had survived. Plus, he now realized that he didn’t need to strike him down just because he was an undead.\n\"So we can’t use the chatting channel anymore? But didn’t you already kill the Archmage?\"\nAll that was left was explaining the current situation to them. First, he explained that, as a result of killing Seagald, the underground’s sun was no more (they just assumed that the night had gotten longer and that the sun wasn’t rising). He then explained what he’d done thus far, which of the 12 Generals he’d killed, and explained the details of the final battle concisely.\n\"We’ve been shown there’s a chance. A chance that an outsider can enter a domain protected by God herself. Of course, all of the heroes are on our side now and the Lich is dead, but... Someone else might try a different approach to tamper with the chatting channel.\"\nSo, he requested that they not use the chatting channel, at least until the Emperor was dead and the Underground Empire was completely purified. What’s worse, they could no longer use their permits to access the secret shop, so they were speechless.\n\"Man, this sucks. The curse is directly connected to the source of darkness. It’ll be difficult for us until we can figure something out.\"\n\"...We can’t buy the medicine anymore, and what’s worse, we can’t buy supplies from the secret shop either.\"\n\"That’s how it is. Well, it doesn’t really matter. Since the final battle is near.\"\nTo be honest, Lee Shin Woo could always break through the Archmage’s curse and enter the secret shop, but he decided not to tell them that.\nIf he wanted to bring them to the secret shop, he would have to form a contract with them. Not only was that a pain in the ass, but the final battle was right before them, so bringing them to the secret shop at this point wouldn’t do much, if anything. To put it bluntly, he didn’t plan on giving them any important assignments.\n\"I’ve saved up a lot of supplies, so you won’t have to worry about that.\"\n\"It’s really surprising that you can travel to the surface... How about we go to the surface and group up with Prince?\"\n\"It’s a good idea, but it’s a bit iffy to bring so many strong people to the surface all at once.\"\nHe was lying. Lee Shin Woo was 100% sure that if he sent this anachronic human and Elf to the surface then something bad would happen. Thus, he had to do whatever was necessary to stop them from going. Fortunately, Lloyd was persuaded immediately.\n\"Is that so? I’d like to purify the undead curse together, but... I guess we could all just go up there after the battle’s over.\"\n\"Of course. We’re really close. ...Really.\"\n\"Ooh, the surface... I’d really like to see its natural environment. There might be a lot of spirits up there.\"\n\"Ah, now that you mention it...\"\nThe Elf, Erian, was more attuned to the spirits and nature than Lee Shin Woo was. Lee Shin Woo hesitated briefly, but ultimately suggested.\n\"Senior, would you like to be my partner?\"\n\"Partner? What are you talking about all of a sudden?\"\n\"Once you’ve purified the Empire, you’ll have to settle on the surface. You’re not planning to live dangerously fighting monsters forever, are you? That’s where I come in! I can offer you a lifelong job. So, for now... well, you’ll see what I mean if you follow me.\"\n\"What exactly are you talking about...\"\nShe followed him, arriving at the grape vineyard directly connected to their wine factory. He could get there in a flash with the Heaven Door’s Key. The atmosphere was completely different, but... Erian quickly noticed. There was no way she wouldn’t.\n\"No, wait. This is... This is the vineyard I entrusted to you!\"\n[Welcome, Paul Zero... Oh, it’s the Elf!]\n[It’s been a long time since I last saw a living, breathing Elf! Nice to meet you!]\nHaving noticed him, the Dryads flew towards him, but once they noticed Erian as well, they began to chatter. Whereas, Erian was dumbfounded at the sight of the Dryads.\n\"How is this possible? To think there were still spirits within the Empire...\"\n\"Do you remember the Forest of Death? There were some Dryads resisting the curse there. I brought them here and cured them of the curse. Because of them, the grapes you raised grew even livelier than before.\"\n\"The Forest of Death...\"\n\"At the time, I remember us talking about it in the chatting channel. If that’s the case, then that means you were already strong enough to get through the Forest of Death back then...\"\n\"Well... yes.\"\nLloyd smiled hollowly. He couldn’t even feel his inferiority complex flare. Lee Shin Woo was in a completely different league.\nWhen he realized how outclassed he was, something with him snapped. But he actually felt relieved. He’d had an urge to become stronger, and the undead curse had only intensified that urge, making him impatient. However, that impulse had disappeared right then and there.\n’I was a fool. There’s no need for me to be more ’hero-like’ than someone else...’\nHim not feeling frustrated or powerless was just an example of Lloyd’s incredible mental fortitude. Once he’d stopped comparing himself to Lee Shin Woo and looked at himself objectively, he became able to do things at his own pace again.\nIf Lee Shin Woo had known what Lloyd was thinking, then he’d say something like ’he’s like a hero straight out of a fairy tale.’\n\"Wait, the energy from when I raised the grapes is still here!? No, it’s not just here, but it’s evolved!\"\n[Hey, Elf. Come over here! There’s a place where the grapes aren’t growing that well!]\n[Spread your elvish energy! It’s best if elves look after fruit!] Dıscover more novels at noveⅼfire.net\n\"I... I understand. Let’s go together!\"\nErian followed the Dryads and disappeared amidst the field of grape trees. With the Dryad’s help, Lee Shin Woo had grown the grapes quite well, but he couldn’t match up to an Elf; Elves were masters of the forest and fields, so if they were to intervene, then the quality of the grapes would skyrocket!\nAs a result, the value of the Kerr Century Elemental Brandy would rise as well. To think that the sole elf on the continent was looking over the grape trees; she was invaluable!\n\"So please do your best, Senior. They say that a half-elf is born with an elf’s authority.\"\n\"W-What’s with you all of a sudden!? ...I-Is it that obvious?\"\n\"It is that obvious.\"\nEven the most dim-witted of men possessed the ability to spot couples!\nCompared to when he’d met them last, he felt something qualitatively different between the two of them. They’d taken at least another step forward. At any rate, if this happens, then...\n\"By the way, what do you think of one man marrying several women, Senior Lloyd?\"\n\"You have to love one person to the very end. I believe that that’s the best I can do as a person and as a man. ...Ahem, I suppose that’s Erian right now.\"\n\"Why are you not like a hero in this aspect... Err, never mind.\"\nIt sounded like Lloyd was criticizing him, or at least, it came off that way. Lee Shin Woo decided to change the subject.\n\"What do you think of Senior Prince?\"\n\"Prince? She’s a good friend. I told you before, didn’t I? It would’ve been hard for me to endure without her.\"\n\"I see.\"\nLee Shin Woo hesitated briefly, but then he glanced at Erian, who was going around the grape trees, and carefully whispered into Lloyd’s ear.\n\"To be honest, Prince begged me to save you; she was even willing to do anything to ensure your safety.\"\n\"Prince really cherishes me that much...?\"\n\"Yes. And Prince is a girl. A girl who’s been with you for a very long time.\"\n\"She already told me, so I know that... Huh?\"\nEven the slow-witted Lloyd couldn’t misunderstand when Lee Shin Woo was spelling it out for him. Cold sweat flowed down his forehead.\n\"No, wait. There’s no way... Don’t joke around, Shin Woo.\"\n\"So you get it. Please think about it by yourself. You’ll find an answer.\"\n\"Hey, wait. Why are you telling me this now!?\"\n’Why now? I can’t be the only one with girl troubles,’ Lee Shin Woo thought. However, Lee Shin Woo didn’t say anything aloud and merely gave him a thumbs up. Behind him, Lloyd was suffering from the truth that’d been laid bare. Serves him right.",

Once he’d brought Erian and Lloyd to his base, he immediately absorbed the bone.\n[Absorbing the Lv8 Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin’s Parietal Bone. Magic has increased by 120.]\n[You have learned the innate element, Beginner Dark Space Lv5. Magic has increased by 50.]\nHis expectations must’ve been too high; though he’d absorbed an Archmage’s bone, his magic had only increased by 120.\nMoreover, Lee Shin Woo hoped that by absorbing the bone, he would master the Lv9 High Rank Mana Bone or Mana Acceleration skills. The skills had certainly grown, but he wasn’t able to master them.\n’More useless memories. Though just learning his spatial magic is huge for me. ...Ugh. His magic seemed so complex and developed, yet it’s still in the realm of enlightenment and elements. But wait a second. Why is this...?’\nLee Shin Woo tested the Dark Space element and tilted his head at the mysterious feeling. It was almost like this feeling was familiar.\nAn absolute ability that linked two spaces through the power of the darkness element. Yeah, this ability was similar to one of Lee Shin Woo’s abilities...! However, that ability was in the form of an artifact. Lee Shin Woo couldn’t understand the inner workings of the ability on his own, but by learning the Dark Space element, he would just gain the Heaven Door Key’s power through his intuition!\n[Dark Space and the Heaven Door’s Key are resonating. You can now absorb the Heaven Door’s Key through Bone Reinforcement.]\nLee Shin Woo widened his eyes. That’s right. The Heaven Door’s Key! When he’d first gotten it, he couldn’t absorb it, so he’d given up on it. But he had found a way to absorb it now of all times!\n\"What if absorbing it causes it to change in some weird way?\"\n\"The Heaven Door’s Key has a similar activation mechanism to Dark Space. At the very least, I’ll be able to create a gate just like before, so don’t worry.\"\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t worried about Bone Reinforcement’s ’blast area’ anymore. The artifact, the Heaven Door’s Key reacted to Lee Shin Woo’s Dark Space and kept buzzing... Lee Shin Woo grabbed the Heaven Door’s Key and briefly closed his eyes. He’d activated Bone Reinforcement.\n[Absorbing the Heaven Door’s Key through Bone Reinforcement. Magic has increased by 500.]\n[You have completely understood the fusion element, Dark Space, and the element is accepted by your karma. The unnecessary facets are removed, and the very essence of the element is strengthened. Dark Space has evolved into the new innate element, Heaven Space! The Beginner Heaven Space Element has become Lv10 and has evolved to the intermediate level. Magic has increased by 100.]\nThe Dark Space element, strengthened by the Heaven Door’s Key’s power, evolved, gaining the ability to merge all elements together, not just darkness.\nHe could not only use this element to transport himself, but others as well. Not only that, his spatial abilities had far exceeded the Lich’s now!\nThis wasn’t just a transportation ability. The Heaven Space element could merge his other innate elements as well; in other words, he would be able to use all his elements simultaneously, which would increase his attack power significantly.\n\"Hoo. Game over, huh...\"\n\"Shin Woo! You’re being really arrogant. It’s your ’arrogance’ passive!\"\n\"Ah, right. Thanks, Jin. Maybe I already have it as an active skill!?\"\nJin’s desperate dissuasion kept him from going off the deep end. Now that he thought about it, the Lich had quite the overpowered ability, but he had killed him anyway!\nYeah. Though he’d finally gained spatial magic, there were several people who could resist its effects. An innate element can only be stopped with another innate element. And all the people he’d fight from now on should have innate elements.\n’There’s really no point in arguing over whose ability is better. I have to use this innate element’s specialty to grasp my opponent’s weaknesses... That’s what’s important.’\nAnother point in his favor was that the Heaven Space element was really compatible with his Wild Card skill. The space element was, like Annihilation Flame, the best skill for him to go: ’I’m here or maybe I’m not. I’m not here, or maybe I am?’.\nCombining Heaven Space with either Annihilation Flame or Dark Shadow... the possibilities were endless. He already had a few ideas... He should get a chance to try them out in the field soon. If he used them in tandem with Wild Card, then an equally leveled opponent, or even a higher leveled opponent, wouldn’t be able to easily notice him.\n\"Yeah. I guess you could say that I’ve only just assembled all the pieces...\"\n\"All the pieces?\"\n\"Yeah. Our goal is to attain victory with the least amount of casualties possible. But we had one problem before: that we didn’t have anyone as strong as the Magic and Undead Emperors...\"\n\"And that’s also why you were so hell-bent on upgrading the Titan.\"\n\"Yep. But the Titan can only be used for a short period of time. If something happened (an emergency), there would be nothing I could do. But now... I think I can take them on with this.\"\nLee Shin Woo was a coward. So if he looked really confident, then it could only be for two reasons. First, when there was a clear-cut retreat path, and second, when there wasn’t a clear-cut retreat path. Whether he was safe, or whether he was sure to die, there was no reason to worry about both of them.\nAnd right now, he was closer to the former. Moreover, having gained Heaven Space had caused his stats to be...\n’25,323, huh...’\nLevel 9 required one’s stats to be a total of 25,600. He could reach level 9 with just 277 more stats. If everything went well, he might be able to level up mid-fight. And if he reached level 9, then he’d be on equal footing with those damn Emperors!\n’Even I’m a bit shocked.’\nTo think that he, who had only been here for 2 years, would be on equal footing with the two level 9 Emperors that had ruled for hundreds of years. Even he couldn’t have imagined this when he had asked God for a growth-type ability.\nIt was only possible by taking everything that they’d built, but it also wouldn’t have been possible without his Joker karma.\nThe Joker. There was nothing better to describe him. It didn’t just accurately represent his ability, but his position in the world as well.\n\"Shin Woo!\"\nRight then, the door swung open and Kratia rushed into the room. She held a small bead within her tiny hands... a small bead that was encased in bone, which resembled a shell of some sort.\n\"The Titan Core’s ready. The energy’s fully charged too. Not only can you transform whenever you want, but...I think the active duration time has increased by a lot too.\"\nIt was only natural that the core’s capacity would increase when they had fused it with the artificial sun. Lee Shin Woo quietly took it and gripped it. The fire trapped within periodically thumped like a heart.\n\"And I’m also finished with the other installation.\"\n\"You did it.\"\n\"You pretty much did everything.\"\n\"Kratia, it would’ve been impossible if not for your ability.\"\nLee Shin Woo and Kratia exchanged meaningful smiles. Jin, in a fit of meaningless jealousy, raked the ground. Lee Shin Woo ignored the tantrum, got on top of Jin and declared.\n\"Alright. It’s great that we finished in time. Call everyone and tell them to gather. ...It’s time for the final battle.\"\n\"Finally...\"\n\"Are we assaulting the capital?\"\n\"Nope.\"\nLee Shin Woo cold-heartedly shook his head. Jin and Kratia just looked at him strangely. In response, he sported his own doubtful expression.\n\"Did you really think I’d launch a direct attack on the capital with this many forces?\"\n\"You weren’t going to?\"\n\"Obviously not. There’s no telling how many of ours will die if we attack head-on now that the sun is gone and the Emperor’s power has increased.\"\nIt made a lot of sense. The Undead Emperor, Jissehanu, was monstrous enough to use the source of darkness itself as his life vessel.\nUnlike the Archmage, the Emperor didn’t possess such superb transportation abilities, but if you got in range of him, then you’d start the battle in a whole lot of pain.\nEven though he had the golem train and the thorn wall was destroyed, they still had to get to the Emperor undetected!\n\"Then...?\"\n\"Our forces will act as a diversion. They’ll lure all of the Empire’s undead away.\"\n\"The undead...?\"\n\"To the surface.\"\nHearing that, Jin wondered whether Lee Shin Woo had gone crazy from all of the stress, or if the undead curse had finally gotten to him from the consecutive Bone Reinforcements.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo’s expression remained serious. Had he seriously gone insane? Jin furtively raised a leg. If it’s broke, then kicking it will fix it! She’d never tried it on a person before, but kicking him at light-speed should have some sort of effect!\n\"I’m not going to invade the surface. You’ve been by my side for a while now. You can guess what I’m thinking, right?\"\nLee Shin Woo looked at Jin as if she were ridiculous for even considering it, and retorted. Indeed, Jin was always by his side. She’d also heard his thoughts the most out of anyone, albeit indirectly. Thus far... so... Check latest chapters at novel⸺fire.net\n\"You were prepared to fight both sides. You were increasing your forces on the surface, as well as your forces underground...\"\n\"Yep, that’s right. I was prepping forces on both sides.\"\n\"Yeah! So, I thought you would use both your forces to... Huh? Wait a sec.\"\n\"...I’ve already mostly figured it out.\"\nUnlike Jin, who was tilting her head, Kratia looked at Lee Shin Woo with shining eyes when he was in Heaven Defying General mode.\n\"Shin Woo wants to destroy both the surface and underground’s Imperial Armies.\"\n\"Yeah. Thus far, we thought Shin Woo’s forces on the surface would take out the surface’s Imperial Army and his forces underground would do the same for the underground’s Imperial Army. But he expects fierce opposition from both sides. At this rate, our casualties will be huge. At the very least, weaklings like Lloyd, Erian, and Prince will die.\"\n\"That’s right.\"\nEven though most of the Magic Empire’s 12 Generals had died underground, the Underground Empire’s 12 Generals were nearing extinction, and all of the level 5 or lower undead were all gone, both sides still retained a significant amount of forces.\nBoth sides retained their elites, the elites that had been there for hundreds of years. He couldn’t look down on either the quality or the quantity of those troops.\n\"...Shin Woo must’ve never planned on fighting them straight up.\"\n\"Keep going.\"\n\"The forces that you’ve developed... Maybe they weren’t meant for fighting.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nA diversion. Lee Shin Woo had definitely said that. If that’s the case, then Lee Shin Woo’s goal all along was...\n\"The surface and underground’s Imperial Armies. Shin Woo plans on using the Heaven Defying General’s troops to lure both armies towards each other, causing them to clash.\"\n\"...Is that even possible?\"\nJin, who was quietly listening beside them, said stupidly. So the heroes, who risked their lives to fight and grow, as well as the religious orders’ forces... They were all clowns on a stage?\n\"It is.\"\nLee Shin Woo grinned and said. Jin, who was connected to him, instinctively took a step forward.\n\"You’ll see soon enough.\"",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 53 part2",
    "content": "<Chapter 53. The Final Stage - 2>\n\"Your Majesty, please listen to the people.\"\n\"Mm.\"\nThe Light General, Sorura Von Lilaine said so coldly that it felt like he’d fall onto the frozen floor. There was even a curtain within this gloomy, dark room, and the secluded Emperor began to murmur to himself.\nShe’d always been cold, but after returning to the surface, she became much more passionate; her voice felt akin to a hot, sharp edge. He knew why. It must be because his loyal subordinate, Arema Steelworker, had died.\nTo think these two had been in a relationship. Moreover, he didn’t think Arema would go so far as to sacrifice himself to save her. To be honest, him dying was only beneficial to him, as Arema’s body had gone missing, but he wasn’t going to tell her that.\n’I was suspicious that Seagald had stolen Arema’s body, forcing him to follow him, but... If that were true, then this woman wouldn’t have come back alive. He either died, or he was taken by them.’\nThe Emperor pondered, but Sorura cut him off like a sharp blade.\n\"This is the limit. We can’t hold it off anymore. We have to do something. Your Majesty, you are personally needed... Or you need to send all of the remaining 12 Generals and the remainder of the elite troops.\"\n\"Mmmm...\"\nThe Emperor groaned quietly. To be honest, the current situation... wasn’t good for him. Originally, the Emperor was going to wait for the undead curse to spread to the surface; when his people discovered the existence of the curse and became antsy, he would only then intervene.\nHe never had any intention of dealing with the source of the curse. Once he’d taken care of the curse, he’d then create a barrier. It was inevitable that the undead and their energy would seep out of the barrier once more, so the people would come to rely on him once more.\n\"The situation’s... not good.\"\n\"No, it’s not. I’m sure you’re already aware. Since your eyes see everything on the surface.\"\n\"Lilaine, are you mocking me?\"\n\"Your Majesty, please leave everything to them.\"\nA new voice said. It was a tuxedo-wearing man, with both hands together and on standby near the curtain.\nIt was the Spirit Sword General, Kuroin Von Begner. He was the most loyal subject of the Empire and was part of the Four Heavenly Commanders, the Empire’s strongest. He cut his opponents down with his sword, which was hidden in shadow. Thus, he was called the Spirit Sword General and had only become stronger by turning into a Vampire.\n\"I’m referring to the alliance of religious orders, led by the woman who claims to be Kay’s disciple. Force those unsightly fools into your service, and let them and the ignorant people fight against the underground’s undead. It’s a good chance to shut them all up.\"\n\"...Hoo, Kuroin. That’s impossible.\"\nUnfortunately, Kuroin wasn’t very intelligent. Did his overzealous loyalty damage his brain? Though he didn’t particularly like Sorura, he agreed with her nonetheless.\n\"The people are far too discontent. Moreover, they have someone they can rely on. It might work if they and the undead destroyed each other, but if they were to win, then...\"\nThe people would wholeheartedly support the religious orders. No, they were already close to doing so. The ’limit’ that Sorura had mentioned was referring to this.\nIf the Emperor waited any longer, and he left saving the Empire to Izuna and the religious orders, then... it was entirely possible for them to take his people and form an entirely new nation.\n\"This is all because of him (Retadane). If he hadn’t caused such a commotion on the surface, then...!\"\nThis must’ve been his goal! Putting the Emperor into a situation where he was forced to intervene or mobilize all of his forces! That’s just how much Seagald had wanted revenge.\nHe felt goosebumps, even though Seagald was a lower level than him. It felt as though there was always a sword beneath his neck. Even now, the Emperor felt uneasy, as he didn’t know when Seagald would come for him.\n\"If I go, then... It would be the perfect spot to assassinate me.\"\n\"Even so, we have no other option. Your Majesty, you just told us yourself that you had to intervene.\"\n\"Keuuuum.\"\nThe Emperor toiled over his choices. Honestly, he’d rather stay here and hide. With double or even triple the soldiers stationed to protect him!\nHowever, that was an unattainable dream. ’If’, ’By some chance’. Those two hypotheticals were just wishful thinking.\n\"Seagald Von Retadane. He’s probably still alive.\"\n\"I, too, would like to kill him right away. He can’t hide forever. But we can’t catch him from in here. We have to go out to do so. And we have to go out to kill him as well.\"\n\"...\"\nSorura remarked, as if ignoring the Emperor’s opinions, yet the Emperor couldn’t bring himself to say anything. Not only was it the truth, but she was also the last remaining light magician in the Empire.\nShe was crucial to stopping Seagald. She, too, knew this fact all too well.\n\"Your Majesty, you don’t have to worry about a weakling like him.\"\n\"...\"\nJirold Von Enard anguished once more. He knew his hand had been forced. The Emperor thought about how he could get what he wanted without being coerced. Ultimately, he came to a simple conclusion.\n\"You go, Kuroin. Kuroin Von Begner.\"\nIt was best to not move exactly as your enemy wished. That policy had always kept the Emperor alive time and time again.\n\"Your Majesty?\"\n\"You’ll be my stand-in. I can’t just leave here. So I’ll leave everything to you. Take the rest of the 12 Generals with you, besides the Light General, and all the elite troops as well. You must perform better than Izuna and her forces.\"\nFor a second, the Emperor’s loyal clansman, Kuroin Von Begner couldn’t believe what he was hearing. But he wasn’t hearing things. The Emperor had opened the curtain and stared at him seriously. He was confused, but he quickly got on one knee and bowed to him in spite of this.\n\"I-I understand. I will break Seagald Von Retadane and Jissehanu, and bring them to you no matter what.\"\n\"You won’t be able to beat Jissehanu. However, he won’t likely be on the front lines. Kill Seagald Von Retadane. He’s the one keeping the underground afloat, so if you kill him, then Jissehanu will retreat back underground.\"\n\"...Understood!\"\nJirold placed his hand atop Kuroin Von Begner’s shoulder. The Emperor’s Lightning Bind flowed from his hand into Kuroin’s body, further strengthening him. This act served two purposes: helping him, as well as forcing his loyalty and preventing insubordination.\n\"Sorura Von Lilaine.\"\n\"Yes, Your Majesty?\"\nThe Light General looked at the Emperor with unconcealed contempt, yet the Emperor shamelessly gave her an order regardless.\n\"You will replace Kuroin as my protector. If, and I mean if, Seagald comes for me during the chaos of the battle, then the only one who can detect him early enough and respond is a light user.\"\n\"...Are you forcing me to stay behind?\"\n\"I am essential to the survival of the Empire. If any harm befalls me, then you won’t be safe either.\"\nSorura gritted her teeth and shook. The Emperor acknowledged her anger but wasn’t going to try to understand it. Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs novel(ꜰ)ire.net\n\"Moreover, there’s a high chance that Seagald comes for me. Light General, if you truly want revenge on him, then it’s best that you stay by my side.\"\n\"Do you really think he can sneak in when you have so many magic traps set up...?\"\n\"He went around the Empire eluding even my sight. Do you really think he can’t do something more?\"\nThe sound of her teeth grinding could be heard once more. However, the Emperor trusted that she, as one of his clansmen, as well as one affected by Lightning Bind, wouldn’t be able to refuse his command!\n\"...I understand. I will do as you say. You disgust me though, so I’ll stay this far away from you.\"\n\"Light General, it’s an honor that the Emperor requires your services, yet you dare to...\"\n\"Get lost already.\"\n\"...Ugh!\"\nIn response to her rage, her body radiated light mana; Kuroin wouldn’t dare approach her and just shrunk back.\nThough he’d been strengthened by the Emperor, it didn’t matter. It might be different for the Emperor himself, but Kuroin had no way of overcoming the Light General’s light. Sorura snorted and said.\n\"You’re my stand-in too. Kill all the undead. Make sure they can never tread upon our soil ever again.\"\n\"...Hmph, I like the sound of that. Then, Your Majesty, I’ll come back after fulfilling your orders.\"\n\"My loyal friend... if you succeed, then I promise to give you a suitable reward.\"\n\"It’s an honor!\"\nThe Spirit Sword General deeply bowed his head, paid his respects to the Emperor once more, and quietly left. The Emperor merely stared at the recently emptied space, but soon closed his eyes and turned his attention to the shaking Sorura.\n\"I’ll give you a chance to get your revenge. I promise you.\"\n\"I would’ve liked it better if that chance... came quicker.\"\nSorura said hatefully and seething with rage, and then turned around. The Emperor’s gaze was automatically fixed onto her back.\nHer elegantly curved body, having no signs of age, her captivating, flowing hair, and her scent, all of which remained unchanged even after becoming a Vampire, aroused him. However, he wasn’t stupid enough to go after a woman who’d just lost her lover and was filled with malice. Yes, a rose had thorns, but these thorns were filled with poison.\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\"I was given an unexpected mission, so I have to go and prepare. ...Surely you can stay here by yourself for a short while?\"\n\"Of course I can. Return after you’ve prepared yourself. 2 hours should be enough, right?\"\n\"Hmph.\"\nShe snorted, as if she could see right through him, and left. He wanted to force her onto her knees with his Lightning Bind oh so badly, but for some reason, it didn’t work on her. Perhaps it was due to her element. There were so many facets of her that were displeasing to him.\n’I should dispose of her once Retadane’s been dealt with. I can just nurture another light user.’\nSorura, who’d left the Emperor’s dark room, dusted her body off as if something dirty had gotten onto her. She then rushed over to her residence. Within her bedroom, which only she could enter, a single small bird awaited her.\n[How did it go?]\nNo, it was a golem in the shape of a bird. Moreover, a young woman’s voice came from the golem!\nSorura, as if she’d done this a few times already, walked over to the bird, or Rem, and... smiled elatedly and said.\n\"The Emperor’s doing exactly as you said he would. I’m ready... to open the gate whenever.\"\n[That’s perfect. We’ll take care of the rest.]\n\"I’ll leave the rest to you. ...Hero Izuna.\"\n[Of course.]\nHer voice, coming from the golem, was a bit delicate, but it was unmistakably the vigorous voice of a young woman.\n[Since I’m fighting for the one I love as well.]",

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 53 part3",
    "content": "<Chapter 53. The Final Stage - 3>\nThe hero Izuna, or Ye Jin Jin, spoke with the Light General and sighed lengthily. They were in the very same mansion that Lee Shin Woo had visited before.\n\"Her drive’s really scary. I talked to her across a long distance, yet it feels like the temperature’s gone down 10 or so degrees.\"\n\"What I want to know is why she’s so willing to betray the Empire, the same Empire she’s protected for so long? So much so that she’s even willing to risk her life.\"\n\"She must have some weird circumstances, Senior.\"\nYe Jin Jin turned around and sighed deeply; Prince had been watching the conversation from behind her. Prince, who had summoned a small Fire Demon’s hand and had been juggling a fireball, stopped and tilted her head.\n\"What kind of circumstances?\"\n\"She was always more concerned about the Empire’s people than her loyalty to the Emperor, and it was complicated enough with a relationship involved, but... Mm, to sum it up, she’s taken Mr. Shin Woo’s bait and become one of our allies. Mr. Shin Woo said he’d ’used a magic formula that replaced her love with anger’.\"\n\"It almost sounds like that magic actually exists...\"\nHowever, Prince acknowledged it. She didn’t know how Lee Shin Woo had caught the Light General, but she had indeed taken the bait. There was no reason to doubt this.\n\"Then it’ll... soon begin.\"\n\"You have a huge responsibility, don’t you? Can you do it properly? If you can’t, then I, your dependable senior, can help you out.\"\n\"N-No, I’m fine.\"\nYe Jin Jin smiled confidently, but once she saw Prince, who was shaking like a newborn fawn, she shook her head with a stiff expression.\nRather than entrust Prince with any sort of responsibility, it would be better to use a golem instead.\n\"Since Mr. Shin Woo entrusted this to me. I’ll prove to him that I’m not incompetent and I’m good enough to walk beside him.\"\n\"But it seems like you’ve been caught by Junior as well.\"\n\"That’s why I’m so happy! The fact that I’ve been caught and that I’m not letting go!\"\n\"...Oh, is that so? What beautiful love.\"\nShe hadn’t expected that! Prince had no choice but to nod and take a step back from Ye Jin Jin’s energetic voice. Ye Jin Jin’s emotions were too profound for Prince to understand, as she was still emotionally immature.\nYe Jin Jin snorted and smacked her chest a couple of times, calming herself down. Now, all that was left in her mind were Lee Shin Woo’s instructions.\n’You have to take control of the army. The Imperial Army will, of course, resist this. That’s when it gets real. You don’t need to control them completely; you just need to lure them in a certain direction.’\nYe Jin Jin truly thought that Lee Shin Woo was a genius. Had he been planning this ever since he’d first come to the Underground Empire?\nIt didn’t matter if he did or didn’t; she was astonished nonetheless. She was even more shocked by how that plan had developed.\n\"We’re splitting up the underground’s undead forces into two groups... The ’good’ undead and the ’bad’ undead...\"\n\"What the hell are ’good’ undead? Are they my junior’s undead?\"\n\"They either won’t attack us at all or will pretend to attack us. Of course, we have to play along. The problem’s the ’bad’ undead.\"\n\"The Underground Empire’s Imperial Army. So we have to...\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nYe Jin Jin nodded her head.\n\"We have to lure them to the surface’s Imperial Army. It shouldn’t be too difficult since Mr. Shin Woo can use Fire Shadow to communicate with both sides.\"\n\"It still sounds really tough... But it doesn’t sound impossible. How many of those innate elements does my junior have anyway? It’s so unfair!\"\nGetting both the surface and the underground’s forces in one place was more than half the battle.\nAll that was left was killing the rest. This was the most important task. They had to succeed no matter what.\n\"Then, don’t we have to draw out the Emperor somehow? Junior’s only making him more afraid, which will make him more likely to hide.\"\n\"We’re the ones in trouble if he comes outside. Not only is he level 9, but he also possesses an innate element. There’s a chance that he could mess with Mr. Shin Woo’s carefully constructed scenario. We can include or exclude him in the plan; it all depends.\"\n\"And right now...\"\n\"We pick the latter.\"\n\"Then what about the Emperor!?\"\n\"The Emperor...\"\nYe Jin Jin paused. She hesitated, as if she was thinking about what to say, but soon continued quietly. Her head was slightly bowed and her face was red with embarrassment.\n\"Mr. Shin Woo said he’d take care of the rest. He said he’d use the Light General to set up a gate and that he’d use said gate to drag the Emperor underground...\"\n\"He’s going to drag the level 9 Emperor underground!? Can you even do that when your enemy is a higher level than you!?\"\n\"That’s why he left the Light General beside the Emperor. I don’t know the details, but I heard that by using both the Fire Shadow and Heaven Space innate elements together, you can substitute a person’s body for a gate.\"\n\"Junior is... already fighting somewhere beyond my imagination, huh...\"\nPrince sported a far-off expression. She had only just learned of the entire plan. Lee Shin Woo would do all the important stuff alone while the underground and surface gathered in one place and performed for him!\n\"It makes absolutely no sense, but I can’t complain.\"\n\"Mr. Shin Woo is actually more delicate than people give him credit for. He’d rather put himself in danger than let his allies endanger themselves. He’s so cool!\"\n\"Sounds like Junior just picked the most rational choice, but as a result, we weren’t given anything important to do, since we’re nowhere near his level... No, sorry. Never mind.\"\nPrince had acknowledged the difference in their abilities, but the timing wasn’t great. SinceYe Jin Jin’s enthusiastic eyes continuously lost their fervor.\n\"Get a grip Ye Jin Jin! If we fail, everything’s over! Your job’s most important in cementing our positions as heroes and protecting the Empire! It has nothing to do with strength!\"\n\"That’s true...! That must be why Mr. Shin Woo gave me this job...!\"\n\"Yeah, exactly!\"\nGood. She somehow managed to cheer her up! Prince sighed in relief and Ye Jin Jin forcefully stood up. Her battle dress, the Phoenix’s Feather, swayed, discharging a weak heat.\n\"It seems like everyone’s gathered already. It’s finally time. Senior, let’s go together.\"\n\"...Alright.\"\nThough they were technically excluded from the important mission, it didn’t mean that they were completely immune to danger. After all, luring the undead and fighting against them wouldn’t be an easy task.\nShe might even die this time. In spite of her Fire Demon training, she may be hit by a stray arrow or spear and fall. However...\n\"...Let’s go!\"\n\"Ok.\"\nThe two left the residence side-by-side and went to the assembly area within the capital. And there...\nElite priests and paladins from the Sun God religion awaited them, as well as the elites from the various religious orders that they’d allied with. And the one representing the Imperial Army was...\n\"Hmph. You’re quite good looking.\"\nOne of the Empire’s Four Heavenly Commanders, Kuroin Von Begner. Befitting one of the Empire’s strongest, he was powerful indeed. However, Ye Jin Jin, who shouldered the people’s will, and had grown immensely in such a short period of time, was around mid level 7 in terms of strength. And with Lee Shin Woo’s artifact, she could handle Kuroin, so she remained undeterred.\n\"You’re pretty enough to seduce two men at once... I wonder how strong you are. Can you even swing that spear properly with those thin arms of yours?\"\n\"Unfortunately, you’re not good looking yourself. Are you called the ’Spirit Sword’ because of your dark face?\"\n\"What!?\"\nRight now, Ye Jin Jin was neither the childish junior hero nor Lee Shin Woo’s girlfriend. She was the hero Izuna, who had taken her master’s place due to his untimely death (The rumors regarding her, Lawrence, and Kay’s three-way relationship were really convincing. And thus, the story that Izuna arose, angry at her lover’s death, had originated from here).\n\"You impudent wench! You’re just a peasant, yet you think you’re able to go around the capital due to your affiliation with the religious orders. This is only because the Emperor allows it!\"\n\"I’d rather you prove your skill with your sword, rather than your mouth. If possible, towards our enemy. Or is the Emperor content with waiting until the undead run rampant on the surface? Isn’t that why we’re fighting?\" ᴛhis chapter is ᴜpdated by novel~fire~net\n\"Kuheum...\"\nAnd a hero must always be confident. Even if their opponent is a Heavenly Commander, who’s representing the Emperor!\nHer level 9 battle dress, as well as the great spirit that resided within her, the level 8 Zenon, supplemented whatever she lacked. Though Kuroin had just recently been strengthened by the Emperor, he wouldn’t be able to take her down!\n’Damn it. Why do I, His Majesty’s representative, have to worry about a mere wench!? And why do I have to act more cautiously around these peasants!’\nBut he had already been warned by the Emperor, as well as the Light General (who had warned him several times).\nIf he were to fight Izuna here, then whether it was justified or not, it would result in the complete collapse of the royal family’s power! The citizens had already sided with Izuna and the religious orders!\n’Seagald Von Retadane, you bastard... How did you manage to unite so many humans in such a short period of time!?’\nIt was truly frustrating to admit, but Izuna was right. He would need to prove his abilities with his sword, not his mouth, against the invading undead.\nOnly then would he be able to ensure the stability of the Emperor’s rule.\n\"Alright. I’ll do just that. I’ll put you in your place! I represent the sovereign of this great Empire, the father of the nation, His Majesty! My words and actions are equivalent to His Majesty’s!\"\n\"I hope you do. It doesn’t matter to me, so long as the undead are all destroyed.\"\nIt had been revealed early on that Izuna only pointed her flames at those who threatened the safety of the Empire.\nHow great it was to sacrifice such dirty power to accomplish such a lofty goal! Her words had a profound effect on all those present!\n\"Uoooooooh! Lady Izuna!\"\n\"Lady Izuna will protect the capital, no, the entire Empire!\"\n\"Lady Izuna, Lawrence, and Sir Kay must be blessed by God!\"\n\"I’ll believe in you, Lady Izuna!\"\n\"Hurray for the Sun God religion!\"\n\"Hurray for the Sun God religion!\"\nTheir reactions were tremendous! Izuna inwardly smiled at the cries of the capital’s citizens.\nThis was the effect of Lee Shin Woo’s lecture! What’s worse, she had memorized Lee Shin Woo’s screenplay and had just been following it, yet at this moment, her Command skill was growing!\nThen, the Pope of the Sun God religion approached her and whispered.\n\"You talk just like your master, Kay. ...I’ll ask one last time You weren’t in some sort of strange relationship with him, right? You might not want to hear it now, but keep this in mind. If we want to oust the Emperor and take control of the Empire, then we can’t have a scandal like that. If you break up with Lawrence at the last minute, then things will become really complicated. You get it, right?\"\n\"Of course. I love Lawrence.\"\n\"Then... that’s enough. I’ll believe in you. Your relationship with Lawrence has to last a long time!\"\n\"Please don’t worry, Pope.\"\nLee Shin Woo was both Lawrence and Kay, so she wasn’t lying! She grinned at the Pope, who was already looking past the battle and raised her head.\n\"Lady Izuna.\"\n\"Izuna...\"\n\"Please protect the Empire.\"\n\"Will she be able to do the same things Sir Kay could...?\"\nShe locked gazes with countless people. There were those who trusted her, those who hated her, and even those who used her to project someone that wasn’t here.\nBut honestly, she didn’t care about any of it. Ever since she’d come to the surface, she’d fought for only one man and one man only. And she would continue to do so until the very end.\n\"...Let’s move out.\"\nThe fake hero raised her voice and said.\n\"Today we restore peace within the Empire!\"",

    "content": "<Chapter 53. The Final Stage - 4>\nShe was the Spirit Princess, the Spirit General, and the Spirits’ Springs’ contractor. The Immortal (a never before seen species), Dana, suddenly raised her head. She’d gotten the signal. Ever since she’d come here, she’d been waiting for that signal.\n\"The Hero is calling us. It’s time.\"\n[Zenon’s gone to the front.]\n[Yeah, I feel like Paul Zero’s calling us.]\nThe Spirits’ Spring spirits had prepared for battle as well. No, perhaps they had waited for this moment over any other. Their hatred and anger towards those who’d abandoned and imprisoned them! They had nurtured their anger and hatred until it was ready to explode!\n\"Are you all ready? You remember what he said, yes?\"\n[We know.]\n[I’d like to kill all the humans, but... I know that we can’t.]\nAs the spirits were abandoned by humans, their anger was indiscriminately directed at all of mankind. But if they weren’t careful, then they would bring ruin to humanity.\nLee Shin Woo had used their anger to goad them on and had turned their anger towards someone else. He limited their targets and had reset their goals. As a result...\n[In order for our descendants to live on the surface, we must...]\n[Side with the humans.]\n[We’ll act like we’re on their side.]\n[We’ll give the humans who embrace us another chance.]\n[If they accept us, that is.]\n[But we can’t forgive the Emperor and his associates.]\nThe spirits, all pumped up, each had something to say. Yeah, that was plenty. Dana smiled and turned around. Sinea flew beside her.\n[When’s our turn? When can we meet Paul Zero again?]\n\"We have to wait a little longer. When the humans begin to despair and start praying for their salvation... that’s where we come in. To disavow the Emperor and all that’s under his control.\"\n[As expected of Paul Zero. He’s trying to change everything with one single battle.]\n\"But still, the Empire’s vast. Though this battle will determine the fate of the Empire, if the battle takes place in an isolated location, it will be difficult to overturn the common perception that has developed over many years with just one battle.\"\n[Yeah.]\nSinea agreed and gazed at the spirits that filled the Spirits’ Spring to the brim. Right now, they were divided into two groups. One group would participate in the battle between the humans and the undead in order to restore the spirits’ status and the other...\n\"The rest of the Imperial Army’s elites will be in this battle. Miss Jin Jin made it that way. Therefore, the forces protecting the cities (the soldiers and the knights commanding them) are minimal.\" ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NoveIＦire.net\n[That’s probably true, but... those soldiers won’t attack us, right? Not only are the soldiers citizens of the Empire, but attacking them will cause the people to hate us more, no?]\n\"You’re right. That’s why the golems are going to attack the Imperial Army.\"\n[...?]\nSeeing Sinea’s head tilt, Dana smiled faintly and continued.\n\"The Hero, through Rem, has already taken control of all the golems within the Empire. With the addition of his innate elements, even the Emperor cannot retake control over the golems. Those golems, which are spread all across the Empire, will attack the Imperial Army all at once... How do you think the people will react?\"\n[They’ll lose all faith in the Emperor! ...But so many people will die!]\n\"It’s ultimately all just an act. Our true goal isn’t the soldiers, who’re just following orders, but the vested rights of the ruling class. The golems were ordered to execute the corrupt nobles and knights only. And after killing them, the golems will act like they’re turning against the people as well, but then...\"\n[That’s where we come in?]\n\"Exactly. We’ll destroy the golems and save the people. If we maximize the Spirits’ Springs’ mobility and the golems match our movements, then it’s certainly possible. It’ll be quite the show.\"\n[You’re actually calling it a show...]\nIt was just a poor show. However, it would still fool the people. When the golems drew near, the appearance of the spirits, who would appear like lightning and rush to their aid...\nContrary to the Emperor or the nobles, who were afraid of the spirits’ power and ostracized them, the people were taught that the spirits were wrongful existences. The nobles that had abandoned them and the spirits that had saved them; it was clear which side they’d choose. Even more so once the Emperor and the nobles that had abandoned the spirits were out of the picture.\n[But Dana, you must know that even if things go according to plan, that...]\n\"...There’s nothing we can do about the resulting casualties; they truly are ’unavoidable casualties’. If we took into account the lives of each and every soldier, then we wouldn’t be here right now. The Hero is also aware of this fact.\"\n[Wow, Paul Zero will really go to Hell when he dies.]\n\"Hoo, hoo. Don’t worry. I’ll follow him down to Hell and assist him.]\n[Dana, you still don’t know Paul Zero well enough yet. One day, Paul Zero will control Hell too.]\n\"Oh my, it’d be well worth assisting him then.\"\n[Haha.]\nThe two women smiled meaningfully and turned towards the spirits. Their power then simultaneously took control of the spirits.\n\"Everyone, get ready! The stage that the Hero has prepared for us... It requires our very best acting!\"\n[Chin up, everyone! This is the first step towards our future!]\nWhereas, Shino Rendu was speaking to his own troops, though its purpose was different. Countless Pauls were following him! ...And there were countless more undead following behind them, trying to kill them!\n[Is that the fastest you can go!? If you’re that slow, then those undead bastards will catch us!]\n[No, sir! We can run even faster!]\nObviously, the Pauls were undead, so their stamina was limitless. To be more specific, of the two domains that governed one’s body... defense and stamina, stamina was essentially limitless. This was why it was so difficult to face an undead in combat.\nIf the undead weren’t able to catch them now, then they would never be able to catch the Pauls in their game of tag. Honestly, this short play of theirs had gone on for two hours already. Thousands of Pauls were being chased by tens of thousands of undead... What’s worse, their pursuers’ numbers were continuously increasing!\n[We’ll kill all of the underground’s undead. We’ll erase all proof of the curse’s existence! Us! That’s our job. That’s what Paul Zero ordered us to do!]\n[For Paul Zero!]\n[His great goal of purifying the entire Empire... All of our efforts have been for this!]\n[Lord Paul Zero, we’re right here!]\nThey uttered such nonsense that it was difficult to distinguish whether they were his troops or a part of his fan club; regardless, the Pauls continued to run diligently! They looked quite funny, but the result was by no means a joke. Looking back, Shino Rendu was shocked.\n’To think that I would be able to do something like this... No, this is also Lord Paul Zero’s will. He really is amazing. No one could’ve ever imagined it. To think he’d both be the one who caused the war that would decide the continent’s fate, as well as the one who would end it...!’\nThrough this battle, Lee Shin Woo was attempting to eliminate all of his enemies on the surface and underground, and simultaneously eliminate all sources of the curse. That was also the reason that he’d ordered the Pauls to ’lure’ so many of the undead over.\n[Not yet. We haven’t gone east yet. Draw out all of the undead hiding about. Bring out all of the undead that are snooping around the city walls!]\n[Uoooooooh! You cowards! The Heaven Defying General is calling you! He told us that he’d take you to the surface!]\n[Follow us. You poor souls who’ve lost your egos! We will bring you true salvation!]\n[G-Guooooh...!]\n[Kuaaaaaah!]\nObviously, this was happening all across the Underground Empire. Shino Rendu was but one of the brigades luring the undead; there were also a small handful of elites with exceptional aggro abilities that lured thousands of undead towards them.\nLee Shin Woo had meticulously divided the Underground Empire into parts and had sent his Pauls off into different locations. He’d ordered his Pauls to lure the undead to the surface. Several of the Heaven Defying General’s corps were currently fulfilling this order of his!\nThough their locations and their destinations differed, the result would be the same. They would lead the undead to the surface! Before proceeding with this mission, Lee Shin Woo had dug several passageways to the surface.\nHe had set up these regional passageways so that they would gather in one single location! The golems had been helping him with this for months now!\n’Leading all the underground’s undead to the surface. And bringing them peace once they get there...’\nAll would dance upon his stage. What was the difference between them and Shino Rendu? At the very least, Shino Rendu knew what his role in all this was, and he had been prepared for his role beforehand.\n’It’s ironic. They had dreamt of returning to the surface, but they’ll be killed after getting a taste of it.’\nThe relationship between Seira Von Retadane and Shino Rendu was also ironic. When they were still alive, nothing he said got through to her, yet after dying, they became true comrades.\n’Though she rejected me outright, and our goals are a lot different from when we were still heroes... Ha, thinking about this now is pointless...’\nHe was getting emotional; it was unlike him. His personal feelings weren’t anything compared to Paul Zero’s orders. Only by following his orders could he obtain that sweet revenge he’d been waiting for!\nShino Rendu smiled bitterly, urged his skeleton horse to run faster, and yelled to his troops in a booming voice.\n[This is where it all starts! Once we get to the surface, we have to act like we’re on the same side as them. Remember what Lord Paul Zero told us! We’re going to push them. To peaceful salvation...!]\n[Lord Paul Zero’s salvation...!]\n[And thus, peace will be restored to the Empire...!]\nMm, it really was a religion. A true pseudo religion. One where the believers had to sacrifice themselves...! Shino Rendu, who wasn’t aware that he was one of them, just smiled bitterly.\nBut then... before they had even moved out, the hero Lloyd was screaming.\n\"Lee Shin Woo went to the imperial palace by himself!? ...What are you even talking about!? Didn’t you say we were going to fight against the Imperial Army now!?\"\n\"Oh, so you didn’t know yet. My bad.\"\nWhereas, Kratia, who was responsible for explaining the battle to them, expressionlessly struck her forehead, and began explaining whilst retaining her expressionless face.\n\"We’re going to follow him slowly. While Shin Woo keeps the Emperor busy, we need to drag out all the forces within the capital and lure them underground.\"\n\"Will that even work!?\"\n\"It will.\"\nKratia, with the Mana Radar that Lee Shin Woo had entrusted to her (as he said he didn’t need it anymore), discerned that a huge amount of undead were moving and smiled slightly.\n\"You’ll see soon enough.\"",

He looked exactly like the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin.\n[But will it really be alright, Father? If the Emperor is aware of the Archmage’s death, then...]\nChi Paul asked worryingly. By reaching level 8, Chi Paul had not only grown substantially in terms of power but had also gained Disguise abilities second only to Lee Shin Woo himself. Thus, he was the best choice to accompany him to the capital. Ironically, Chi Paul was currently disguised as a normal undead.\nOf course, he wasn’t any normal undead. It was more precise to call him an undead hero. Lee Shin Woo knew, from the Archmage’s memories, that the Archmage enjoyed using the undead heroes as guards. Thus, Chi Paul was disguised as an undead hero.\nAll the other 12 Generals were dead and the Emperor likely knew this as well, so even if he wanted to impersonate one of the others, he couldn’t.\n[Although the Archmage pledged his loyalty to the Emperor, he doesn’t trust him. The Emperor knew this and respected him anyway. Because of this, their relationship was able to last.]\n[You’re saying that...]\n[The Emperor doesn’t know about the Lich’s death. He has no way of knowing. Of course, he’d be suspicious of the Archmage’s absence, but how long has it been since I killed the Lich? It’s only been four hours. Moreover, before then, the Lich left, stating he’d take care of the heroes. He wouldn’t suspect anything in that short period of time.]\nOf course, Lee Shin Woo, who had got going right away, had killed the Lich and had brought the majority of the undead heroes to his side... However, if he were to go to the capital right now it would be him ’returning’ to the capital, not infiltrating it.\n[Ugh, I can finally act like a human, yet I have to take this form.]\n[I’ll turn you into a perfect human someday, so just wait a little longer.]\nBecause the Archmage didn’t ride a horse, Jin was currently disguised as an undead hero as well.\nShe looked very much like her human form, but because she was ’undeadified’, she didn’t seem to like it very much. Only a very, very small portion of her body had bone or muscle exposed, yet she hated it anyway. Whether it be one cheek or one shoulder exposed.\nAt the very least, he had left her legs intact so that she could move properly. Moreover, she had covered her body from head-to-toe with silver steel, so she didn’t look like an undead at all.\n[I’m not pretty.]\n[It’s fine. You’re plenty pretty to me. I’m not kidding. You really are.]\n[Then can we kiss?]\n[Nope, no thanks.]\n[You want to die?]\nJin gritted her teeth at Lee Shin Woo’s firm refusal and practiced walking. She’d been a horse for so long that when she took on her current form, she began placing her hands on the floor.\nHowever, she was quickly able to adapt, perhaps due to her authority, and was soon able to move quickly on her two feet as well. Lee Shin Woo confirmed that she was able to move on her own, nodded his head, and said.\n[You guys just need to stand a short distance behind me. You don’t need to say anything. Since we’re now entering the heart of enemy territory...]\nHoo... Lee Shin Woo exhaled (even though nothing came out), and relaxed himself. Of course, he was no longer afraid of the Emperor. This was nothing more than the nervousness of an actor before he got on the big stage.\nWhile he was at it, he might as do it perfectly. There were so many unknowns on this stage, so if he were unable to do his job properly, then it would be a pain in the ass later. If he died, he would revive due to Invisible Heart, but he couldn’t revive others.\nHe knew he would revive if he died, but he’d rather live than die. He obviously had so many ways he could survive. If he didn’t want to live, then he could always die later. But he couldn’t do that right now.\n[...Alright, let’s trick them to the very end and come out alive.]\n[Pfft, that’s so like you. Sounds good.]\n[You sure have weird taste.]\n[T-Then... Father, excuse me.]\nJin grinned and came closer to Lee Shin Woo. Chi Paul, looking apologetic, came closer to him as well. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and softly swung his hand.\nThen, just like with the Archmage, the flow of mana connecting the two spaces formed and sucked them in. They were immediately transported to the capital, inside the palace (the most dangerous area within the capital) at that!\nOnce they were transported, time began to flow once more. This was proof that Lee Shin Woo both understood and could use the time element better than the Archmage. Hurray for Bone Reinforcement and innate elements!\n[...Archmage?]\nOnce they arrived, they faced their very first obstacle. It was the last of the underground’s Four Heavenly Commanders, the general who’d killed the Sun Spear General (who had been one of the surface’s Heavenly Commanders), the Heaven Sundering General, Leofield Von Tariman!\nBy absorbing the Sun Spear General’s bone, Lee Shin Woo had already seen Leofield’s spearmanship, as well as his other skills. But it was different seeing him in person.\n[Isn’t it obvious, Duke Tariman? Everything you say reeks of sweat.]\nThe huge undead came over, and although Lee Shin Woo was nervous from his appearance (a Death Knight), he replied exactly as the Archmage’s memories indicated.\nHe was huge; now it made sense that people wondered whether he inherited a Giant’s blood or not. His body was covered in muscles, and these muscles, despite him becoming undead, pulsed and wriggled with cold blood and magic, as well as the air element. The pressure he emitted was so great that it felt like it could stab him to death.\nHe’s on the same level as Seagald? No way! Though Seagald’s swordsmanship may surpass Leofield’s, if he compared the degree of perfection of their bodies, as well as their training, then Leofield was superior! He could completely understand why all the spearman he’d come across had yelled Leofield’s name!\n[Hmm, did your job go well...? Huh?]\n[I’d appreciate it if you stopped looking at me like that. Are your ears starting to fail now too?]\nAlthough the Archmage and the Heaven Sundering General, as two of the Four Heavenly Commanders that pledged their allegiance to the Emperor, respected each other, they possessed a slightly troublesome relationship where that respect wouldn’t show outright.\nAs they had reached the pinnacle of their respective arts (magic vs. martial arts), they were prideful in their arts and frequently clashed with each other. However... the Heaven Sundering General’s reaction was a bit strange, considering how he was following the Archmage’s memories to the letter.\n[Are you really... the Archmage? Hmm, something’s strange.]\n[What’s strange is your brain, Duke Tariman. It was always strange; has it finally completely rotted away?]\n[No, I’m not the one who’s strange. The smell... The smell is strange. Hmm... strange. It’s strange.]\nLee Shin Woo shuddered. Once his Acting skill had passed the level 20 mark, no one had ever seen through his Acting or Disguise skills. However, the rumored musclehead was suspicious of him!\nWhat the hell happened? No, he had no time to be thinking! If Leofield was suspicious of him, then he’d bring it up to the Emperor as well. He had to stop him!\n[You’re already stupid enough, but if you keep saying the same thing over and over again, you’ll become even stupider. Tell me, what’s so strange? The actions of the heroes? The Anti-Skull led by the damn Seagald? If not, then the Heavenly Commanders that came from the surface?]\n[I’m talking about you, Archmage. You’re strange. My intuition... is telling me that.]\n[Your intuition? You really like that, huh. I was always fed up with that intuition of yours. I hate how you do things without any logic or evidence.]\n[You’re right. I’ve always trusted my intuition.]\nEven if he were to bring up their shared memories, it wouldn’t work. The Heaven Sundering General took out his spear and gripped it. And once he gripped his long, gray spear, the atmosphere inside changed completely.\nWhen one reaches level 8, they gain an authority: the ability to treat the ambient mana as their own and absorb it. However, the way they go about doing so differed depending on the individual. The Heaven Sundering General seemed to be able to absorb the surrounding mana with his spirit alone.\n[If I’m wrong, I’m truly sorry. But I feel like something will go wrong if I don’t do this. I have to do this no matter what. If His Majesty questions me, then I’ll accept it without question, but I don’t have any choice right now!]\nHeaven Flash. It was sometimes used to describe lightning cascading through the air. If so, then why was it used as the name for Leofield’s attack when he used the air element? The answer was exceedingly simple.\n[Hate me if you must!]\nThe moment he’d thrust his spear, it had already reached its target. All you would see was a lightning bolt shooting towards you.\nThe shock was akin to getting struck by a lightning bolt. The Heaven Flash would kill anyone equally. And that’s where his title of Heaven Sundering had come from.\n[Critical Hit!]\nEven the Archmage couldn’t dodge this. It was impossible for Lee Shin Woo too.\nEven if he tried to teleport away the moment Leofield went to grip his spear, preemptively attacked him, used the Annihilation Flame to erase his presence and confuse Leofield, or used all of his innate elements combined, the best he could do was turn the spear’s trajectory.\nHe wasn’t 100% confident that he could dodge Leofield’s strike even with all that. That was the Heaven Flash. And that was the Heaven Sundering General, a level 8 that had surpassed the limits of a level 8.\nThus...\n[...You really are the Archmage.]\n[Are you satisfied now, you blockhead?]\nLee Shin Woo didn’t move at all and let himself get hit by the Heaven Sundering General’s attack. Leofield’s strike had pierced through his armor and bone. Even Lee Shin Woo found it a bit laughable that there was a spear dangling in his forehead.\n[I’m really sorry. This is the first time my intuition’s been wrong.]\nThe Heaven Sundering General calmly removed the spear and apologized. To be honest, Leofield hadn’t attacked with the intention to kill. He had just wanted to see if the Archmage was the real deal or not.\nWhy? Because the Archmage didn’t need to dodge his attack, as his soul was stored someplace else.\nEven so, it would take a considerable amount of time and mana to restore his (the Lich’s) body, so Leofield had held back so that he didn’t destroy the Lich’s entire body. This was only possible because he was the Heaven Sundering General.\n[The first time? Duke Tariman, this is your second time.]\n[The second time... Ah, that’s right. That was the first time.]\nLee Shin Woo had wisely brought up one of their shared memories. This was an elaborate ploy to ensure his opponent’s trust! Despite the situation, the Heaven Sundering General smiled lightly and said.\n[The first time I saw you, I was sure that you could cause harm to the Emperor... So I attacked you back then.]\n[Back then, I wasn’t a Lich. I really would’ve died.]\n[I can say this now, but you’re the only person in this world that could counter my attack that way. It’s hilarious that I’m saying this now, but I’ve always been amazed by that magic of yours.]\n[Hmph. I’ll find a way for you to repay me later, so just get back to what you were doing. The battle where we wipe out those dirty invaders is nigh. We have to mobilize all of the capital’s troops.]\n[Of course... For the Emperor!]\n[For the Emperor.]\nThe two exchanged hot glances and passed by each other. Leofield hurried, as he needed to gather the troops in time, but Lee Shin Woo needed some time to treat his wound. He naturally slowed his pace.\n[The High Rank Regeneration skill has become Lv7, and Health and Magic have increased by 20.]\n[That asshole. He’s so strong that my Regeneration skill went up by two in one go. A skill that refused to level up at that.]\n[You’re cursing him out even though your skill leveled up.]\n[Your acting was perfect, Father.]\n[...Anyway, that guy’s really scary. The Heaven Sundering General.]\nLee Shin Woo recollected the Heaven Sunder General’s attack, as well as his ’intuition’ that was close to busting him, and trembled. But he couldn’t help but laugh. It was only natural.\n[The Emperor would come to harm due to the Lich, huh... Ha, that guy’s prediction is right on the mark.]\n[I can’t tell whether you’re making an evil expression or not since you’re a skeleton. Remember that.]\n[Ah, I can change my expressions as a skeleton now, you know? Want to see? This looks really evil.]\n[Hey, stop. I said stop.]\nThe party joked around and then refocused themselves. They went towards the final battle.\nThe Undead Emperor, Jissehanu, was waiting for them.",

    "content": "<Chapter 53. The Final Stage - 6>\nFor hundreds of years, the giant hall was kept clean through the Emperor’s magic, and it was in this hall that Lee Shin Woo met the Emperor. There were guards standing beside him, but they were pretty insignificant to both the Emperor and Lee Shin Woo.\nBut there was something striking: the throne that the Emperor sat on. There was also a small magic circle set up behind it. Lee Shin Woo knew about it, as it had been set up by the Archmage himself. It was a door. A door that led to the cave where the source of darkness was hidden.\nIt was paramount that he took control of it...! In a sense, doing so was more important than dealing with the Emperor!\n[Your Majesty.]\n[Feo...]\nThe Emperor’s voice was dismal, yet emitted powerful energy. Lee Shin Woo sensed the unconcealable magic from within his voice. It was exactly as the Archmage remembered, but experiencing it first hand was... As expected, this was a true level 9.\n[Lv9 Lich Emperor - Jissehanu Von Enard]\n’Compared to the Magic Emperor, who used his Lightning Bind to meet me indirectly, and the Garuda, which had been eaten away by the curse for so many years, severely weakening it... The Undead Emperor’s power is completely different.’\nLee Shin Woo smirked. This is how powerful he was when there was only a slight difference in their stats? No, that was impossible!\nAfter meeting the level 9 Emperor, Lee Shin Woo recollected something. Levels wouldn’t increase by just accumulating stats. One could only grow by reaching a certain ’level’ and proving themselves worthy!\nThus far, Lee Shin Woo hadn’t acutely felt this phenomenon because all of his feats had been more than enough to level up. He had never hit a ’wall’ before.\n’That’s how it’s gone so far, but will it be so easy this time... Well, I’ll never know until I actually reach 25,600 stats. Until then, I have to just try my best. Like right now... No, even more so.’ ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ NoveI-Fire.ɴet\nUnlike the pressure he was emanating, the Emperor gazed at him with drooping eyes. When they locked gazes, he desperately began to think. The moment he seemed surprised by the Emperor’s power would mark the end of the line for him! Contrary to the Heaven Sundering General, the Undead Emperor was, in a different sense, a natural enemy to Lee Shin Woo’s Acting skill!\n[I took care of a majority of the heroes. But there were a few rats that slipped through my net. But I found out that they had an unexpected connection.]\n[What we feared has come to pass. How are they connected...?]\n[It’s Seagald. He used the Metal General, who has ties to the surface, to form an alliance with the surface.]\n[Oooh...]\nLee Shin Woo said, as if sure of its validity and the Undead Emperor interjected for the last time.\n[I’m afraid of him. I feel as though he’s trying to change something from within me. His loyalty to me hasn’t changed, yet he’s completely different from you. What is it? My wise friend and teacher. Do you know what that is?]\n[...You already know the answer, Your Majesty. My clever Emperor. He dared doubt you and wanted you to become exactly how he envisioned. That’s nothing more than perverse loyalty. No, it’s stubbornness!]\n[Feo... I’m scared.]\nThe Emperor said weakly. If the other heroes, who assumed that this guy was the final boss, were here, then what would they think? They would just be speechless and click their tongues.\n[I’m afraid of the surface. I’m afraid of everything that’s left me behind and changed.]\n[Your Majesty, you rule over all that changes and all that doesn’t.]\n[Do you really think so? My friend, do you really think that’s true?]\n[If you wish for it, then time itself will stop and bow before your feet, Your Majesty. So what is it that you are so worried about?]\n[My friend, I... I’m afraid of changing.]\nLee Shin Woo was silent. He thought, ’This guy’s like a hikikomori...’, but there was nothing he could do about it since it was the main trait of the undead.\nIt was actually kind of sad; even a level 9 undead, with such great magic and status, was the same as any other undead. He suddenly felt as though Seagald was amazing, as he had broken free of those shackles. It was such a relief that he’d already killed him!\n[Your Majesty, you’re already a perfect existence. No one can dare match up to you.]\n[I’m not so sure. Perhaps... Perhaps I’ve already changed. My friend, why was it that I so ardently longed for the surface? Why was it that I wanted to get my revenge on Jirold so badly?]\n[He’s the reason we’re down here. It’s because he stole the light away from us.]\n[But now, I feel so comfortable with this darkness. I don’t want to leave. Every day, I imagine myself ripping Jirold to shreds, but even though I can go through the barrier, I can never bring myself to do so. My friend... where did I go wrong? Aah, what did I do!?]\n[Your Majesty...]\nThe Emperor had only just realized that the undead curse he’d developed had a fatal flaw. But unfortunately, he couldn’t turn back time. That’s because undead, as a species, could not move forward by themselves. They not only couldn’t move forward, but they also couldn’t look back at the past either.\nThe dead. They had lost not only their lives but also a path to follow. Thus, they couldn’t go forward, nor could they go back.\n...But Lee Shin Woo was here. If there wasn’t a path, then he just needed to make one!\n[That’s too much, Your Majesty.]\nLee Shin Woo did his duty as the Archmage and calmed the Emperor down. Though he had reached level 9 and become transcendent, the Emperor wasn’t capable of escaping his fate as one of the dead. Thus, his statement was mixed with a small bit of pity towards the Emperor, Jissehanu.\n[You can do anything you wish, Your Majesty. Taking a brief respite within here is your decision, so all of creation must abide by your wish. When you decide to leave here, then everyone will follow and support you!]\n[Feo...!]\n[Please don’t doubt yourself. You are an existence which has obtained great karma, yet you also transcend existence. Since you haven’t forgotten about your revenge against Jirold at all! If Jirold were to appear before you, then wouldn’t you raise one hand and crush him, Your Majesty!?]\n[That... Of course!]\nThe Lich’s encouraging words caused the Emperor to stand straight up and agree. Normally, the Emperor wouldn’t move an inch, so the sudden movement caused the Emperor’s guards to flinch. They should’ve noticed by now that Lee Shin Woo wasn’t the Archmage!\n[My desire for revenge hasn’t left me. Not at all. My friend, you spoke well. Although I felt comfort in the darkness, that doesn’t mean my desire for revenge has disappeared! On the contrary, no matter how many days or years go by, my desire for revenge still remains strong!]\n[That’s right, Your Majesty! That hasn’t changed at all!]\nWell, it shouldn’t. He was an undead after all. This emotion (rejecting change) was an undead’s most powerful emotion, and this emotion was controlling the Emperor as well, so there was no way he’d be able to escape its binds for even one second!\nThe Emperor, who cradled this cursed feeling like it was a blessing, was so pathetic that it was hard for him to continue looking at him. Is this what a fight was supposed to be like? He had a bitter taste in his mouth. Ah, he chewed on some bone powder.\n[Then, what will you do if I, your humble servant (skeleton), have a solution to your plight?]\n[...A solution?]\nThe Emperor tilted his head. Contrary to Leofield, the Emperor hadn’t doubted Lee Shin Woo from the beginning. It couldn’t be helped. After all, that was what Lee Shin Woo was all about.\n[If I can bring Jirold before you, then what will you do, Your Majesty?]\n[Bring Jirold... before me...?]\nThe Emperor slowly reiterated his question. He couldn’t even imagine it. The Archmage had never said something like this before, but...\n[You would bring Jirold, who’s hiding on the surface, before me?]\n[Yes, Your Majesty. It took me quite a long time, but I’ve become able to do that now. I prepared (and developed) my space element for this very moment.]\n[I know how extraordinary your space element is... So with that power, you can finally get through the barrier and...]\n[It was only possible through your grace and the source of darkness. So, this is also your karma, Your Majesty.]\n[Is that so? ...I see! So you’re saying that it’s because of me that you were able to go through the barrier!]\nThe Emperor accepted his magic tinged words as the obvious truth. That was the power of Instigate.\n[The Instigate skill has become Lv10 and has been maxed out! Others perceive your lies as truth. No, it becomes the new truth. Magic has increased by 50. By mastering one of the Joker’s innate skills, your other skills’ growth rate increases. One of your karma’s conditions has been fulfilled.]\nHe had mastered one of the Joker’s innate skills! At that moment, Lee Shin Woo’s (nonexistent) heart thumped and pleasure spread throughout his entire body.\nThe 50 Magic increase wasn’t important. There was a more fundamental and extreme change that was affecting his very existence...!\n’I’m not far.’\nNot far from what? He couldn’t tell. However, Lee Shin Woo thought that instinctively. With the stat increases from Regeneration, his total stats were now 25,412. All that was left were 187 stat points.\nHowever, there was something more important than stats right in front of him. It was waiting for him to figure out what it was!\n\"Oh...\"\n\"Your Majesty, are you dreaming of snails?\" [1]\nWhereas, on the surface, the Light General was watching the Magic Emperor, looking at him as if he were hopeless.\nShe spoke impolitely, but the Emperor wore all sorts of defensive equipment (that had been in the palace’s treasury). And if that wasn’t enough, he had wrapped scrolls engraved with all sorts of magic formulas onto his body. Thus, the Emperor’s authority was still powerful.\n\"Everything will end soon. Since our forces should be clashing with theirs now!\"\n\"Yes, I heard that too.\"\n\"The Imperial Army will take care of everything. They’ll take care of everything before the religious orders even have a chance. I trained my soldiers so diligently for this very moment!\"\n\"Sure, sure.\"\nAnd that was exactly what the hero, Izuna, had been hoping for.\nThe Magic Emperor seemed so pathetic that the Light General felt like she’d click her tongue. He should already know that the undead were not to be underestimated; after all, none of the Vampire’s he’d sent previously had come back alive!\nDespite that, the Emperor was sure that his soldiers and knights, as well as the 12 Generals, would be able to take out the undead without any difficulty. But where exactly did this confidence come from!? He was definitely relying on the negative effects of becoming an undead.\n’...Then again, I’m not much different. A long time ago, I was willing to sacrifice my own body to get my revenge...’\nThen, at that moment... She shuddered. The alarm magic formulas that she’d set up prior had just gone off.\nA thick smile appeared on her face. She spoke tiredly at the Magic Emperor, who seemed to become more and more like a snail, which had found a large house to wander around in.\n\"Hoo. Rather than acting so foolishly, why don’t I ’accompany’ you?\"\n\"...Really?\"\n\"I know you’re suspicious of me. So shouldn’t I be trying to gain your trust in a time like this? It’s regrettable, but we both seem to be acting in the best interests of the Empire.\"\n\"I’ve never once questioned your loyalty. ...Ah, of course.\"\nThe Magic Emperor had always desired her, but she had always narrowly escaped his grasp.\nHe couldn’t go after her when Arema Steelworker was still on the surface, as he couldn’t hurt his loyal retainer. But when he abandoned Sorura and went down underground, Sorura had immediately married another man. And she eventually became a widow.\nDespite that, the Emperor couldn’t give up on her. He convinced her to become a Vampire so that she could eventually be with Arema, and ultimately transformed her into a Vampire.\nAt the time, he thought he was almost there. The Vampire that created another Vampire... In other words, the children would always think highly of their ’father’. Moreover, he was able to forge a deep connection with her through Lightning Bind, so it was easy for him to force a relationship with her!\n...However, she was barely affected by him, even after becoming a Vampire, perhaps due to her light element. Thus, the Emperor was forced to give up on her. But to think that she, who had rejected him for so long, had accepted him so easily!?\n\"...I can pretty much tell what you’re thinking, but I can’t let you do everything.\"\n\"O-Of course. I can’t do something shameless to a virtuous woman like you.\"\nEveryone said that in the beginning. In the beginning, at least. The Emperor decided to magnanimously accept her fussing.\nBut he never knew when Seagald would strike, so he didn’t strip off all of his equipment. He only de-equipped a few pieces of excess equipment and briefly took off the scrolls that would impede his movement.\n’This all doesn’t matter much anyway.’\nSorura, who was watching him, noted that he looked more and more hideous. Even so, she didn’t let it worry her and she approached him. After all, saying a few things he wanted to hear would allow her to get close to him without him being suspicious of her.\n\"Then... Shall we go to bed?\"\n\"Yes, Your Majesty.\"\nThe Emperor’s hand touched Sorura’s shoulder.\nAnd a black flame shifted to the Emperor and blazed.\n\"...Huh?\"\n\"This is called Fire Shadow. You can either transfer your power to your contractee, or you can use magic through their body. Since Heaven Space or a space-type element is mixed into it, it proves that the underground heroes have grown beyond our wildest imaginations.\"\nSorura said. Her face had already become black flame. Soon, even that flame shifted to the Emperor.\nEven if he tried to deal with it with the darkness element or Lightning Bind, it was difficult, as Sorura was facing him. Sorura, who had always rejected him, was using that link between them to her advantage! The deep darkness that linked the two of them was getting in Lightning Bind’s way!\n\"What is this... Keuk!?\"\n\"Then... I hope you have a good night, Your Majesty.\"\nThe Emperor could say no more. The Fire’s Shadow that came from Sorura engulfed the Magic Emperor and had erased him from his current location.\nSorura, now alone, was quite pale, but she hadn’t died.\n\"I thought it’d burn me too. Was it a lie...? Well, whatever. There are still some things I need to do.\"\nOf course, she trusted the heroes, but the Magic Emperor may return, so she decided to destroy the place that he could return to.\nLight erupted from her hand. After she, with a joyous expression, had vaporized the Emperor’s bedroom, she began to destroy the rest of the palace.\n[1] E/N: TLDR: it’s someone who aims to live a slow, steady and peaceful life.

    "chapter_number": "Chapter 53 part7",
    "content": "<Chapter 53. The Final Stage - 7>\nThe target of his so ardently desired vengeance was right before him. The ’Archmage’ had been so confident in his endeavor that Jissehanu was momentarily stunned. However, he soon realized what must be done and began to act.\n[Jirolddddddddddd!]\n[Keuk, Jissehanu!? How!? What the hell happened!?]\nWhereas, Jirold, who had been waiting to hear the good news, had fallen into Hell. Compared to Jissehanu, he hadn’t grasped the situation right away. That allowed Jissehanu to make the first move.\n[Kuhahk!?]\n[Jirold, I wanted to see you! I really wanted to see you!]\n[This... Jissehanuuuuuuu!] Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs Novᴇl_Fire(.)net\nEven if it’s rotten, it’s still a herring, huh. Once Jirold was struck by Jissehanu’s darkness, he got a hold of himself and began to counterattack. Dark lightning crackled, gathered around his hands, and shined.\nJust because he possessed Lightning Bind didn’t mean his combat abilities were low. He was a Vampire, a species that specialized in magic and regeneration, and had also nearly mastered his lightning element!\n[I don’t know how you brought me here, but Jissehanu... Bringing me before you was a huge mistake. Have you forgotten? Long ago, you weren’t able to beat me. By becoming an undead, have you forgotten about my strength along with everything else!?]\n[I remember, Jirold. I remember it as if it were just yesterday; how ruthless you were to me and my friends. But time has passed. So much so that it feels like we were playing house back then! ...And it seems like you’ve become an undead too. How hilarious!]\nThat’s right. It didn’t matter what they were thinking before, or who/what intervened. Now that they’d met, they would have no choice but to fight until one of them died!\nThe Magic Emperor’s lightning clashed with the Undead Emperor’s darkness midair. Contrary to Jirold, Jissehanu was a magician that had maxed out his darkness element and used it as his standalone element. Thus, his darkness was far greater than Jirold’s lightning.\n[Hmph, you’ve been immersed in this darkness and have become quite close with it it seems. Now I’ll show you that lightning can even tear through that darkness you hold so dear!]\n[...Keuk!?]\nJirold soon realized that if he kept using the lightning element, he’d lose, so he began using his Lightning Bind. Lee Shin Woo wasn’t aware of this yet, but Lightning Bind was a perfect battle ability.\nWith Lightning Bind, Jirold transferred all damage dealt to him to those connected with him, and could steal their Magic, Health, Strength, and Agility to bolster his own stats. That was the true power of Lightning Bind!\nThe Magic Emperor hadn’t fought on the frontlines thus far, so he’d never had a need to use it that way. However, Lightning Bind reinforced the darkness element’s ’link’ ability close to its limit!\n...If he could use Lightning Bind properly, that is.\n[Keuk, why...]\n[I can tell what you’re trying to do, Jirold. However... This is my palace.]\nJissehanu mocked him.\n[You probably erected a barrier around your palace too. Did you think I wouldn’t do the same?]\n[How did you...!?]\n[I was always one step behind you, but it was my barrier that allowed for the creation of this Empire. And for the past several years, I’ve strengthened that ability again and again! Though there was an unfortunate incident a short while ago that destroyed a part of the barrier...]\nWhen the light blast had struck the capital, the Undead Emperor had been extremely confused. He was nervous, thinking that perhaps Seagald truly intended to uproot the entire Empire.\nHowever, there was one good thing that came out of it. As the Undead Emperor no longer needed to maintain the barrier, he was now able to conserve some of his mana. He didn’t obsess over remaking the damaged barrier, and instead focused on reinforcing the palace’s barrier.\nIt had turned out to be a wise decision. Even if Jirold used his Lightning Bind, its effects couldn’t penetrate the palace’s barrier, thus stopping him from affecting or being affected by others!\n[Keuk, Jissehanu, you dare... you...!]\n[Jirold, shall we play? We have plenty of time anyway. No one will be able to interfere.]\nThe aftermath of the two Emperor’s magic had already erased the palace’s guards from the face of the earth. The palace was completely empty. Of course, there was no way that the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin would be affected...\n’Feotane may be skilled, but he cannot intervene in my battle with Jirold. Moreover, linking the space between the two palaces must’ve taken a heavy toll on him. ...I’m so thankful to him. I hope he got away safely.’\nThen, he heard a commotion from afar, outside of the palace. The Archmage probably knew he would be of no help and had decided to command the troops in his Emperor’s stead. Since Jirold wasn’t the only enemy they had to face right now.\nNo, this was where things would truly begin. The battle between the undead and the dirty humans on the surface would begin in earnest. The Archmage should be able to lead their troops to victory on behalf of the Underground Empire!\n[While our troops fight, let us also fight to our heart’s content, Brother! It reminds me of so long ago!]\n[You disgusting... Fine, I’ll take you on. Let’s see who’s superior!]\nThe two Emperors clashed once more. As they were both level 9s, the ambient mana vibrated mercilessly. But due to Jissehanu’s barrier (within the hall), the ruckus didn’t escape the palace’s walls. They were dueling for supremacy!\n...Because of that, Lee Shin Woo was able to move a bit more freely.\n\"I can’t believe you’re so calm, even after seeing that.\"\n\"I have to be calm. They’re both freakishly strong; whenever they attack each other, their bones creak, and they hurt each other. How can I not be calm? At the very least, neither one of them will win one-sidedly, so I won’t have to take over.\"\n’Man, the Magic Emperor, Jirold, fights a lot better than I expected’, Lee Shin Woo muttered under his breath and Jin just stood there, dumbstruck.\n\"I was worried that both Jirold and Jissehanu were both hikikomoris, but it seems like they’re a good match. Maybe it’s because they’re both hikikomoris. Wow, look at that mana splitting in the air. If I grow just a little more, then I could create stuff with just a speck of mana.\"\n\"I don’t even get what I’m looking at... Just looking at it makes me shake.\"\nThe extremely compressed magic clashed repeatedly within the air, but it actually wasn’t very flashy. Whenever their magic clashed, they would cancel each other out, and the barrier prevented any impact.\nIt’s just... Despite that, Lee Shin Woo couldn’t make light of their battle. Anyone who could wield mana should be able to feel it. How powerful Jissehanu’s sphere of darkness, as well as Jirold’s black Lightning Bind were.\n\"Wow, this is really informative. As expected, they didn’t waste their time over the years. Then again, there was a lot to learn about the Archmage’s magic too... Damn, I’m on the cusp of mastering Mana Acceleration and Mana Bone.\"\n\"So you’re just going to sit here and keep watching that lecture on mana?\"\n\"If I could, I would, but... Tch, I guess I can’t.\"\nLee Shin Woo wanted to watch the view while eating some popcorn, but unfortunately, he didn’t have that much free time right now.\nFor the time being, Lee Shin Woo had used the Annihilation Flame to erase their presences, so no one noticed them. Normally, maintaining Annihilation Flame wasn’t very difficult for him. Because his Annihilation Flame had reached intermediate level 2, he was able to pull off this imitation.\n\"I know where it is and I pretty much know how to open it now, so let’s go. Man, it’s really tough to move around with both Wild Card and Annihilation Flame on.\"\n\"I’m more surprised that we can move around right under their noses...\"\nLee Shin Woo had summoned Jirold to fight against Jissehanu and buy him time. He’d already done that, so what else was left? Obviously, he needed to destroy the source of darkness; also known as Jissehanu’s life vessel!\nIf Jirold managed to kill Jissehanu, then Jissehanu would resurrect at his life vessel. Not only did he have to finish things before then, but if Jissehanu managed to kill Jirold, then he’d noticed an abnormality with his life vessel and come to stop him. Either way, he needed to destroy the life vessel ASAP.\nIn other words, timing was paramount. It really befit a hero’s last mission.\n\"Damn it, if I didn’t have this overpowered ability and had an overpowered stealth ability instead, I’d be able to take care of this easily...!\"\n\"How overpowered would it have to be for you to be able to resolve this situation so easily?\"\n\"Not sure. About the level of being right in front of God, but her not noticing me...?\"\n\"Isn’t that the level of a god...?\"\nHe claimed they didn’t have any spare time, yet they moved towards the location of the magic circle while hypocritically joking around with each other.\nIt seemed as though Jissehanu felt that his own life was important, as he fought centered around his throne. However, Jirold was no pushover, so he was continuously forced away from the throne area.\nWith Lee Shin Woo’s Wild Card (which allowed him to completely understand the situation), and Jin’s Agility, which allowed his movements to border on foresight, they avoided everything and arrived in front of the magic circle.\n\"Oh, wait. Where did Chi Paul go? Didn’t you bring him along to use as a meat shield if things got dangerous?\"\n\"Are you crazy? I’d rather die once than use something that precious as a meat shield.\"\n\"Then why did you bring him...?\"\n\"I gave Chi Paul a really important job. Yep, it’s really important.\"\n\"...? Are you using Fire Shadow right now? Why are you using it now?\"\nA portion of Lee Shin Woo’s hand was tinged in darkness and burned quietly. Seeing that, Jin tilted her head. Lee Shin Woo just smiled bitterly and said.\n\"I’m doing that.\"\n\"You mean that thing where you transfer your powers to someone else? ...Does it really matter if you transfer your combat abilities to him?\"\n\"It matters, because I’m not transferring my combat abilities.\"\n\"Huh...?\"\nJin tilted her head, but then... A man, who looked exactly like the Emperor, yelled in a booming voice from outside the palace.\n[The time has come. My loyal subjects. Stand up... It’s time for us to take revenge on those who imprisoned us within darkness!]\n[Uooooooooh!]\n[Obey His Majesty! His Majesty is leading us personally!]\n[It’s a holy war! To war!]\nThe elite soldiers and knights seemingly became intoxicated from each and every one of his words. No one doubted the ’Emperor’s’ appearance or words. A black flame briefly erupted from his shadow, but no one had seen it.\nAll of the Imperial Army’s elite troops marched from the capital. Lloyd and the hero squad encountered them, and they all rushed towards the exit set up within the level 5 danger zone (this was the hardest one to dig up. It was like building a tower and breaking through the ceiling).",

    "content": "<Chapter 53. The Final Stage - 8>\nSeagald hadn’t had a deep understanding of Fire Shadow, so he’d only used it as a convenient transportation ability. However, Lee Shin Woo was different.\nHe was not only well-versed in both fire and darkness, but also commanded scores of subordinates and could commune with them. Therefore, Lee Shin Woo could use Fire Shadow to turn his subordinates into ’little Lee Shin Woos’. If he slightly adjusted his abilities and applied them to his subordinates, then what would happen?\n...That’s right. It would be hell on earth.\n[Your enemies aren’t here! Our (the undead) enemies are the humans! Do you not see those contemptible humans gathered on that vast plain!? Do you truly not see those humans, who brazenly live and breathe on the surface!?]\nOf Lee Shin Woo’s many loyal retainers, one of them, Shino Rendu, yelled out in a booming voice.\nJust a little while ago, Shino Rendu and the Pauls had been roaming across the Underground Empire, spewing all sorts of insults towards the undead. They had finally passed the long underground passageway (to be honest, they were afraid of the existence of the barrier, not the barrier itself. Once they passed through it, they felt like it wasn’t really a big deal) and had gotten to the surface, all while maintaining their hostile attitude towards the undead. So, the fact that Shino Rendu was going around talking like this sounded ridiculous. However...\n[H-Humans...!]\n[He’s right. It’s the humans...]\n[Attack the humans! We can’t attack our brothers (fellow undead)!]\n[D-Don’t shoot, they’re allies!]\n[Kill the humans. Their healthy skin, their flowing blood, and their pulsing hearts! Let’s kill all the humans and turn them into beings like us!]\nThe underground undead, which had followed them and seemed willing to give up their skulls to kill the Pauls, had surprisingly been persuaded by Shino Rendu’s speech and turned their sights to the humans! Shino Rendu’s attitude had changed so suddenly that even the Pauls, which had been luring the undead, were stunned.\n[To think our commander had that kind of ability...]\n[Maybe he gained a power that resembles Lord Paul Zero’s by following him.]\n[It makes sense. Lord Paul Zero truly is great!]\nNot many had noticed the black flame shadow beneath Shino Rendu’s feet. Even if they did, it didn’t matter. Since there was only one person in this entire world that could figure out the principle and the result behind this ability!\n[You guys listen up too! From now on, we’ll arbitrate the battle. Don’t die! Save everything that should be saved and kill everything that should be killed! This is the order of the Heaven Defying General, Lord Paul Zero, the sole man to crush and overturn the heavens!]\n[Uoooooooh!]\n[Paul Zero! Paul Zero! Paul Zero!]\n[Lord Paul Zero has given the command. It’s time to bring order back to this land! We’ve finally found land where we can live in peace!]\n[Keep following him, he who led us all the way to the surface! Show him that we can be victorious in any battle!]\nThe Pauls’ cheers wouldn’t abate and just got louder and louder. Though they may have started at different areas, the other Pauls began to join them. Even the underground undead were affected by Shino Rendu’s magnificent Instigate and acted like they were possessed; they were fooled by him and didn’t know up from down, and soon stood at the forefront of the battle.\nIf the Emperor, the Archmage, or Seagald had seen this, then they would’ve gone crazy! Shino Rendu had taken control of so many of the Underground Empire’s undead so easily! However, this would’ve been impossible if not for Lee Shin Woo’s ability. It hadn’t been easy.\n\"All forces, listen up!\"\nWhereas, on the opposite side, the hero Izuna, was raising her voice as well.\n\"We’ve come here to protect the surface, and to prevent any more pointless deaths! We must protect ourselves from the undead that seek to do us harm, and protect our wills as well! All who live within the Empire are its master, so we must work together to protect the Empire!\"\n\"Uoooooooooh!\"\n\"Hero Izuna! You’re already a hero!\"\n\"Indeed. We, who live in the Empire, must protect it ourselves!\"\n\"Praise be the sun!\"\n\"Hurray for the Sun God!\"\n\"Hurray for the Sun God religion! Hurray for the hero, Izuna!\"\nWhile Ye Jin Jin was orating with such a booming voice, there was, of course, a black fire blazing beneath her feet. Her magical speech, which seemed to bedazzle even her allies, had even gotten the Pope of the Sun God religion to lose his mind momentarily.\n\"What exactly is happening... Did Kay remain as a vengeful spirit since he wasn’t able to do everything he set out to do and possess Izuna?\"\n\"We’ve arrived at the Setoni Plains, Pope. We really have to focus now! Since the undead have already begun advancing!\" Latest content publıshed on novel-fire.net\nThe Setoni Plains was the location that Lee Shin Woo had chosen for the final battle.\nIt was closest to the underground’s exits, while also being incredibly vast and suitable for battle. Also, there weren’t any innocent civilians nearby, so there wasn’t any risk of the undead curse affecting them. Therefore, for all these reasons, Lee Shin Woo had tasked his forces to lead the underground’s undead here and fight. Ultimately, everything had gone smoothly.\nThe board was all set according to Lee Shin Woo’s specifications, and Shino Rendu had already completed about half of his plan already. Obviously, Shino Rendu, who was in command of the Pauls, as well as the hero squad, were retreating after leading the undead here.\nThat’s why it had been possible for them to gather all these undead in one area without them getting away.\nThere were some people who found this strange, but their doubts were wiped clean due to Izuna. They needed to kill them all, so it wasn’t bad at all that the undead had conveniently gathered in one place for them!\n\"U-Undead! Yeah, we have to take care of the undead... Heok, there really are a lot of them!\"\n\"But it’s ok. We won’t be in much danger.\"\n\"Huh? Ah, now that you mention it, it does seem that way.\"\nYe Jin Jin grinned and said, and the Pope briefly tilted his head. He soon nodded his head in understanding.\nOf course, the Pope didn’t know of Lee Shin Woo’s true identity (an undead) or what his forces were comprised of for that matter. However, he somewhat knew what tactics the hero, Izuna, was using, and had even given her advice on certain facets of her plan. It was just that the undead force was much larger than he’d anticipated, so he had forgotten all about it for a moment.\n\"I can’t bear to see those religious orders do whatever they wish, especially that ridiculous Sun God religion! We, the Emperor’s loyal clansmen, are the ones who will protect the Empire! The people only live on because of His Majesty’s grace! The Empire belongs to His Majesty alone! Now is our time to prove that!\"\n\"Of course!\"\n\"For our great Emperor!\"\n\"For the Empire!\"\nThen, as if refuting Izuna’s grand speech, a part of their forces broke away from the battle line. The Imperial Army had broken away from the main force and had rushed towards the undead!\nFrom the very beginning, the Imperial Army had only acted like they obeyed Izuna, but had one goal and one goal only: being the only ones that would distinguish themselves in battle.\nThey had lost their temper and ran in recklessly, as if Izuna’s speech had gone against the very foundation of the Empire, as well as damaging the Emperor’s dignity! ...And that was exactly as Izuna, no, Lee Shin Woo had planned.\n\"But what will you do if they aren’t able to do a significant amount of damage to the undead? It’s good for us if the Emperor’s forces are cut down, but there’s no point if we sustain more damage as a result, no?\"\n\"Please don’t worry, Pope. Where do you think my strength comes from?\"\n\"Doesn’t your power come from your ability and your artifact? ...Heok, is Kay actually still alive!? To think that the ’Supplementary Story Volume 7 - The Resurrected Flame and Izuna’s Unconcealable Ambition’ was based on a true story...!\"\n\"Please tell me in detail where that book is sold later on.\"\nShe had already collected all of the books featuring Lawrence and Kay as the main characters, but she hadn’t known about the supplementary stories! Ye Jin Jin asked him with such a serious expression that the Pope was momentarily overwhelmed. He meekly nodded his head, and Ye Jin Jin cleared her throat and continued.\n\"Obviously, I don’t get my power purely from the Sun God. I also can’t wield flames by myself. No matter how great the artifact is, do you really think that I would be able to wield such flames because of it?\"\n\"If that’s the case, then... is that it? You’ve surpassed the realm of humans and you’re using the spirits’ power...\"\n\"...Yes.\"\nAs expected, the Pope was no fool. He hadn’t gotten a single read on Kay, but after watching Ye Jin Jin’s abilities for a while, he’d formulated several ideas.\nIt was just that he knew that Ye Jin Jin wasn’t a bad person, and above all, he had kept his mouth shut as she was beneficial to the Sun God religion. He truly was a utilitarian person.\n\"I’m borrowing the power of the spirits.\"\n\"As I thought... I even thought you might be a spirit yourself, but that wasn’t the case. You’re borrowing the power of a spirit, huh.\"\n\"About that... What do you think?\"\n...While he was always concerned about profits, he wasn’t by any means a miser. After all, as Pope, he worked for the believers of the Sun God.\n\"To think that a spirit would once again help a human. I’m very thankful.\"\n\"Eut...\"\nYe Jin Jin’s sudden question should’ve caught him off guard, yet the Pope answered seriously. Of course, as an individual with a high post, he was somewhat able to piece together what had happened long ago.\n\"The humans, no, the leaders of the Empire (magicians) were only concerned about maintaining their power, so they ostracized the spirits. I can’t even begin to comprehend what the spirits thought at the time, as they only regarded humans as their friends. Despite that, not only did they not seek vengeance against mankind, they decided to help us by bringing someone like you to our side... This must be the Sun God’s will.\"\nYe Jin Jin’s Phoenix’s Feather blazed fiercely at the Pope’s words. It was proof that Zenon had an intense reaction to the Pope’s words, regardless of whether it was positive or negative. However, Ye Jin Jin guessed that they weren’t negative feelings.\n\"...As expected of you, Pope. You’re no normal person.\"\n\"Of course I’m not. I was the one who discovered Kay after all. Did you forget?\"\nThe Pope wrinkled his eyes at Ye Jin Jin’s admiration and replied slyly. Of course, it was more correct to say that the Pope had arrived at just the right time for Lee Shin Woo to use him, rather than him discovering him, but... Ye Jin Jin didn’t mention that and just grinned.\n\"Are they... No, are you all trying to use this battle to reestablish ties between humans and spirits?\"\n\"Yes. I’d like for that to happen.\"\n\"It’s a bit late to be so frank with me, but... Well, I guess it’s not too late. Make sure your results show.\"\nThe Pope spoke, remaining ever so calm, and raised his weapon. An intense flame could be seen at the tip of it.\n\"If you don’t fulfill your mission, then I’ll take care of the rest. A world of humans and spirits... It sounds quite nice.\"\n\"Yes, I believe it sounds quite nice too.\"\nYe Jin Jin replied, smiling, and raised her javelin. She infused fire into it and threw it.\nThe largest battle between the undead and the humans... the curtains for the greatest play had finally risen.",

    "content": "<Chapter 53. The Final Stage - 9>\nWhile the two Emperors staked their lives on their brotherly spat, Lee Shin Woo released the magic circle, allowing him access to the passageway that led to the cave where the source of darkness was stored!\nWhat’s surprising was that neither Jissehanu nor Jirold had noticed him doing so! His Annihilation Flame was plenty overpowered!\n\"It’s quite narrow.\"\n\"It really is. It’s way too narrow.\"\n\"...Hey, you sound excited.\"\n\"Nope, not at all. I have no idea what you’re talking about.\"\nThe two entered the cave. The cave was incredibly dark and was narrow enough that a person would find it difficult to pass through; therefore, Lee Shin Woo and Jin were forced to stick right next to each other.\nLately, Jin became noticeably excited whenever they engaged in ’skinship’. Because she was currently in a form that closely resembled her human self, he couldn’t help but feel anxious. But he supposed that that wasn’t really important right now.\n\"This is all Evil Eye (ore).\"\n\"So that’s why you’re picking all of the ore and feeding it to your Titan Core. That’s all well and good, but weren’t you the one who said we should hurry?\"\nNot only were the cave walls lined with ore that was suffused with thick darkness magic, but they were all connected to the center of the cave... In other words, they were connected to the source of darkness. And if one were to enter this cave without permission, then the one in charge of this cave... The Emperor, would know they were here.\nBut because Lee Shin Woo had maxed out his darkness element, he could completely ignore it and feed all the Evil Eye to his Titan Core. It was all too easy for him to hide his activities from the Emperor.\n\"The Titan’s all I can rely on if we find ourselves in a pinch. So long as I have this, we won’t lose.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah, I got it. I wasn’t complaining. Let’s just get going.\"\nLee Shin Woo had already explained the new Titan to Jin already. When she’d first heard about it, she was worried that it might not even move properly, but Lee Shin Woo had been so excited that she decided to accept it, albeit bitterly.\n’Moreover, he said he needs me to operate the Titan, so... Mm, will it really work? I’m a little happy that he brought me all the way here. ...Err, I guess this really isn’t the time. I really have gone crazy.’\nJin knew how ’severe’ her condition was. This was all Lee Shin Woo’s fault; he’s the one who’d told her that ’she could become human again’! So, it wasn’t her fault at all!\nJin thought to herself, whilst changing her expression again and again. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo became speechless. However, he didn’t point it out. He was busy enough picking the Evil Eye ore from the surroundings and feeding it to the core.\nBut good things couldn’t last forever. Everything has an end, and the cave had an end to it as well.\nThere was a small clearing at the end of the cave, large enough for them to take a breather, as well as a small bead at the center, which was small enough to fit in Lee Shin Woo’s hand.\n[Lv10 Source of Darkness - Lich Emperor’s Life Vessel]\n\"Holy shit...\"\n\"Is it because there’s a ton of mana in there, even for you? Can you really handle this?\"\n\"To think I’d get in so easily... It doesn’t make any sense. I thought there would be a level 10 Steve here or something!\"\n\"You didn’t come here to screw around, did you!? Did you!?\"\nAt this point, she couldn’t tell whether Lee Shin Woo was happy or sad about this! After retorting, she sensed something approaching, so she raised her arm and protected him.\nHer arm was instantaneously covered in dozens of layers of armor! Right after, she caught something, causing the layers of armor to shatter into thousands of pieces. It was a thick spear.\n[As I thought.]\nFollowed by a weighty and serious voice resounding throughout the cave. It was a voice he’d heard just a little while ago.\n[My intuition was right all along. To think you’d try to destroy the Empire. It seems like... you’re not the real Archmage. I guess I’ll never be able to look him in the eye.]\n\"...Bro, why are you coming out from there?\"\nHe was so astonished that he couldn’t help but retort. He briefly wondered whether he was seeing things or not.\n[Lv8 Heaven Sundering General, Leofield Von Tariman - Elite Death Knight]\nThat’s right. The Heaven Sundering General, Leofield Von Tariman, blocked their path as if he were protecting the source of darkness.\n[My intuition’s always been good. It’s as if the wind spirits are whispering in my ears whenever there’s danger... Whenever I sensed danger, all I needed to do was follow those whispers.]\nObviously, there were no such spirits around Leofield.\n[It was the same this time too. Even though there was no mistaking that it was the Emperor speaking and commanding the troops, I felt a sense of déjà vu. Something felt strange; I was sure of it. However, I could not ’test’ His Majesty as one of his loyal retainers. I didn’t know what to do, but then... the wind led me here. Just now!]\nHe then thrust his spear towards them once more. But this time, Lee Shin Woo blocked it himself. Leofield’s spear and his Death God’s Shining Bone Sword clashed, causing his sword to creak. Yet, he was able to push him back with his blade. Truly a formidable spirit and strength.\n\"The wind led you here...? As I thought, you have an innate element of your own.\" New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on NoveI~Fire.net\nTo think there was a guy who’d gone with the flow of the second act at the very last minute (everyone having innate elements). Lee Shin Woo was absolutely speechless. He had been so relieved that the Undead Emperor hadn’t had an innate element, yet here he was, facing off against Leofield who had one!\nFollowing Seagald’s Annihilation Flame and the Archmage’s Dark Space, it was a space-type innate element!\n’Maybe an innate element is a foothold.’\n’God herself wields the time element, so maybe combining time and space is a realm above the gods?’. Lee Shin Woo’s mind briefly focused on that very question. However, the Heaven Sundering General, who’d reached the peak of martial arts, noticed this and thrust his spear to finish him during his lapse of attention.\nLeofield’s spear was surrounded by a wind that could cut through space itself! This thrust was backed by his trained, transcendent body, and his magic!\n\"Anyway... I think you’re misunderstanding something.\"\n[Keuk!?]\nLee Shin Woo easily repelled Leofield’s thrust. He used his Assimilation skill with Jin, who was standing right beside him, to add her Agility to his own. ...Actually, it wasn’t all because of his Assimilation skill.\n[The Manatization skill has become Lv9, and Health and Magic have increased by 40.]\nAnd thus, his stats had reached 25,493. He only needed 107 more stat points to reach level 9.\n[What...!? Just a little while ago, you didn’t have such strength...!?]\n\"I made it. Or should I say, I switched it with my overwhelming magic stat.\"\nLee Shin Woo extended his hand, grabbed onto the spear (which was facing his sword), and forcefully pulled. With Manatization, he had converted his 10,000 or so Magic into Strength, which resulted in... such power that he felt like he could squash an entire mountain, allowing him to easily steal Leofield’s spear away from him.\n[Kuhahk!?]\n\"There.\"\nLeofield’s eyes widened, but Lee Shin Woo just gripped the spear, unconcerned.\nThe artifact, which was created by using the most precious metal in the Empire, infused with the Archmage’s magic, and had achieved so many feats with the Heaven Sundering General, as well as transcending its limitations and growing... was futilely crumpled up within Lee Shin Woo’s hand.\n[This can’t be...]\n\"The reason I let you live was because you’re needed on the surface to make the battle look realistic. What am I supposed to do with you now, you blockhead?\"\n[You, you’re not...]\n\"Yep. I’m not afraid of you one bit. Sorry, but you can’t beat me. I guess you could call it a dog’s death.\"\nIn the past, Dana and Seira had warned him again and again about the dangers of the Heaven Sundering General, Leofield Von Tariman. Of course, at the time, Lee Shin Woo had just laughed it off.\nAnd just a short while ago, he could somewhat understand what they were talking about. He was sure that if he were exposed, then it would all be because of this guy. So, he was definitely one scary bastard.\nHowever, he wasn’t worried about his power; only his intuition. Lee Shin Woo wanted everything to go perfectly, so he’d been wary of him! At the very least, he needed to not be exposed until he had tricked the Emperor!\n[I’ll die a dog’s death, you say...!?]\n\"Yep.\"\nHis ’play’ was already a success. So even if Leofield were to block his path, if Lee Shin Woo were to use his full power, then... He actually found it quite hilarious that Leofield would be so willing to attack him when he couldn’t even gauge the difference in their strength.\nHe wasn’t even level 9, yet he wanted to defeat him? He had mastered three elements, wielded six innate elements, and even had Manatization as well. What a joke.\n\"I don’t even need to use the Titan to beat you. If you wanted to even give me a bit of a hard time, then you should’ve come for me before I killed Seagald. If you came then, you might’ve had a chance. Yeah, you might’ve even taken two of my lives.\"\n[That cannot be. My spear was tempered so that it can be used to protect His Majesty at all times...]\n\"Sorry, but I don’t have time. You’ve really wasted a lot of my time already.\"\nLee Shin Woo wasn’t going to listen anymore. At any rate, the target was huge and the space was large. He launched a Shining Bone Sword; piercing through Leofield’s body. Obviously, one of the Heavenly Commanders wouldn’t fall from just one attack. Because of that, he launched twenty more of them, which he’d prepared earlier. It was simple, so long as he used the darkness element’s link ability.\nThen, the Heaven Sundering General obviously disappeared without a trace.\n[You have hunted a member of the 12 Generals, the Lv8 Heaven Sundering General, Leofield Von Tariman! All contributing heroes gain 50,000,000 Perium and all stats are increased by 100! You have acquired 15 permits to God’s secret shop. Proficiency in all combat-related skills has increased significantly!]\n[Through God’s grace, the Invisible Heart skill’s maximum level has increased by 6. The Invisible Heart skill’s level cannot be raised any higher.]\n[You have not yet met the conditions for a level up. You must prove that you are worthy of the karma that you have chosen.]\nAh, as he thought. He’d definitely reached the 25,600 stat benchmark, yet he hadn’t leveled up! This was the first time he’d ever experienced this, so he was a bit perplexed, but he could understand why it happened.\nHe’d been gaining stats so quickly! On the contrary, he was more surprised that he hadn’t gone through any obstacles when leveling up in the past. But it was ok. He could still win with ease.\n\"You... just now...\"\n\"Ah, you mean killing him? It was easy since I stole his weapon and attacked while he was confused.\"\n\"Is it really that simple?\"\n\"That’s the truth, so how else can I explain? I already told you how to take advantage of your opponent’s openings, right?\"\n\"You...\"\nIf he were acting whilst fighting, then no one would be able to distinguish between his truth or lies. Then again, it was because he had the proper abilities to support his acting that made it so flawless.\nBecause he was far stronger than the Heaven Sundering General, his bluffs were more effective than usual. The Heaven Sundering General could do nothing but lay down and die. Truthfully, his dramatic actions had confused the Heaven Sundering General and prevented him from moving; and he was soon able to strike him down.\nEven so, Jin wasn’t able to comprehend what he’d done, even though she had been watching from right beside him. She was shocked by the sequence of events spanning a few seconds, as well as how naturally and quickly he’d killed the Heaven Sundering General.\n\"Shin Woo, you’re really...\"\n\"You can talk all you want later. Let’s focus on what’s in front of us.\"\nLee Shin Woo focused on the burst of mana that he felt from outside. As expected, the Heaven Sundering General dying inside here had let Jissehanu know that there was an intruder. Thus, he tried to get over here immediately, but Jirold had seized that opportunity and counterattacked, turning the tides.\nThis wasn’t good. If Jirold managed to kill Jissehanu, then he’d appear right in front of them!\n\"Hey, can’t you just use the Titan to kill both Jirold and Jissehanu...?\"\n\"You never know! What if, after killing them, a level 10 Steve shows up!\"\n\"You really like Steve, don’t you!?\"\nJin threw a fit, yet she readied herself to protect him anyway. In the midst of this, Lee Shin Woo finally placed his hand on the life vessel. Then, a huge, a truly huge amount of mana flooded his body.\n\"Ugh...\"\nLee Shin Woo could feel it.\nThat this wasn’t something he could just absorb.\nThat he was totally screwed.",

    "content": "<Chapter 53. The Final Stage - 10>\n[Aaaaaaaaah! Guaaaaaaah!]\nA wail resounded throughout the battlefield. Who exactly was screaming, and for what reason? Those fighting couldn’t discern the source of the scream.\nBut whenever that beautiful, frightening, unforgettable, and horrific scream resounded throughout the battlefield, someone died. Someone would collapse, and someone else wouldn’t be able to move.\n[Aaaaaah. Uaaaaaaaah....!]\nSeira had gotten over her past as a hero, and continued to wail as a Banshee. She continued to wail. Lee Shin Woo was also increasing her strength! A shadow of black flame covered her entire body.\nWith the help of Lee Shin Woo’s Wild Card skill, not only did her Banshee’s Cry buff allies, but the effects were further increased as well! Updates are released by novel⟡fire.net\n\"This way! This way... Keok!\"\n[I killed one of them! Let’s go!]\nTheir allies were weaker and their enemies were stronger. The knights, who had suddenly led the enemy forces, died due to their trivial mistakes. And that allowed the allied forces to regain the lead.\n\"If we just hold out a little while longer, then reinforcements will... R-Reinforcements will...!\"\n[Lord Paul Zero has commanded us. Don’t discriminate and kill them all. Give them the death that we all wish for!]\nThe allied forces were stronger due to their extreme change. If they got even the slightest of leads, they wouldn’t allow their enemies time to breathe.\nThe allied forces’ blades would always, without fail, cut off their heads or pierce a vital area, while the enemies’ blades would flounder in the air. Some of them even managed to embed their swords into their own bodies!\n\"How can this be? It’s too one-sided...\"\n\"Is that the power of a Banshee? How is a single Banshee doing this to our entire army!?\"\nThe Vampires were dumbstruck by the spectacle. Ignoring her tears or her wails was easy enough, but they noticed that wherever her voice reached, there was an increasing frequency of deaths!\nHer voice brought death to the enemy, but it also continuously strengthened the Heaven Defying General’s troops. Moreover, the range of her screams was by no means ordinary! To be honest, the reason that Lee Shin Woo could be absent from this battle was because he could rely on Seira’s authority.\n’Mm. With Fire Shadow’s effects, you can just cry and influence the progress of the battle however you wish.’\n’I told you. Out of everyone, my ability has the highest affinity with you. ...Unfortunately, it’s something I never wished for!’\n’It’s too late for you to go all tsundere on me at this point... In any case, I’ll leave this to you. If Ye Jin Jin’s my representative for the human side, then you’re my representative for the undead side, not Shino Rendu.’\n’Hoo, of course.’\n’So, I was just wondering. Are you and Shino Rendu...’\n’Though you’ve become my master, you cannot manipulate my emotions as you please. Y-You may be able to do what you want with my body, but... You dirty and underhanded bastard!’\n’Hey, I never said I’d do anything of the sort! I respect your independence you know!’\nLee Shin Woo recalled his conversation with Seira prior to the battle and smiled. To think he’d be laughing at a conversation with such an infuriating person; he felt that he himself was strange, but he couldn’t help it. He just laughed automatically.\n[Guhiiiiiii! Huoooooooooh!]\n[Hiik!]\n[The Banshee’s crying! She’s looking at me!]\n[We’re going to die! Right now!]\nShe continued to scream, but she now wore a smile on her face. Seira became even stronger than before, and there were even some soldiers that fainted at the sight of her. Despite the fact that several of them were undead!\n\"Seira, what exactly are you...\"\nWhereas, Lloyd and the heroes, who had accomplished the most difficult mission of leading the undead here (Why exactly was it the hardest job? Not only was the average level of the Underground Empire’s Imperial Army incredibly high, but the passageway from the capital to the surface was the most perilous), had disguised themselves as a volunteer army that attacked the main force’s rear. In the midst of that, Lloyd’s eyes widened at Seira’s power.\n\"Do people change that much when they become an undead?\"\n\"Perhaps. Love also might’ve changed her. Ah, I see Prince over there. She’s become quite proficient in handling the Fire Demon... No, she’s gotten a lot stronger.\"\n\"Ye Jin Jin is here too. ...Is that really Ye Jin Jin?\"\nThey saw Ye Jin Jin throw all manner of throwing projectiles, as well as her flame, to burn countless enemies to a crisp. They knew that she, under Lee Shin Woo’s request, had become stronger, but this was a bit too much, wasn’t it!?\n\"Everyone who’s involved with Lee Shin Woo goes through an extreme change.\"\n\"Keuk...\"\n\"That goes for you too, Lloyd. You grew substantially. Mentally and physically.\"\n\"...Erian.\"\n\"Hey. You can talk about sex later. Focus on the battle for now.\"\n\"S-Sex!?\"\nLloyd and Erian had a good thing going there, but Kratia, who was quietly casting, coldly interjected. Their job was to protect Kratia until she was finished casting her spell!\n\"Everyone’s changed a lot. Really...\"\n\"You haven’t seen anything yet. You’ll see, once we’ve mostly cleared out the Imperial Army.\"\n\"What happens then?\"\n\"...Ye Jin Jin will show us soon.\"\nKratia was telling the truth. Ultimately, countless undead had sacrificed themselves to kill Kuroin Von Begner (it was the Underground Empire’s Imperial Army, of course), and once the squads led by the remaining 12 Generals were destroyed, the undead forces pushed even harder, as if aware of their impending victory!\n\"Damn it. These undead never tire, do they!?\"\n\"We’ll be pushed back at this rate. I’m glad that that despicable Begner was killed, but at this rate, everyone will...\"\n\"...Please don’t worry, everyone.\"\nWhat dramatic timing. ...No, that was a lie. Lee Shin Woo had picked that timing to make it look dramatic. The hero, Izuna, raised her spear and stepped forward.\n\"We have allies that will help us!\"\n\"Allies... Are you referring to that volunteer army?\"\n\"They’re helpful, yes, but that’s not enough to turn the tide...\"\n\"Oh, spirits!\"\nAt this point in time, a long speech would be pointless. There was something far greater: feats and results! Once Ye Jin Jin yelled, a giant gate appeared in the center of the battlefield. It was the gate that connected the surface to the Spirits’ Spring.\nThe Spirit Princess and now the Immortal Princess, Dana, stepped out of the gate! Her beauty caused the forces to lose all focus and look at her in awe. However, she hadn’t come here for people to marvel at her appearance.\n\"Oh, spirits!\"\nThe beautiful and powerful Immortal Princess, Dana, recited her script as politely as possible.\n\"The humans require our aid! These heinous ghosts are dirtying the surface! This land, which is both our base and our place to live!\"\n[Aah, it smells like the curse! This disgusting smell, which seeks to bring everything to death!]\n[Spirits, it’s our turn now! It’s time for us, as residents of this world, to drive out the curse!]\n[Uoooooooh!]\nThough the spirits were somewhat awkward, they nonetheless stuck to their lines. Of course, if one looked at them closely, their awkwardness would show, but because they had appeared when the surface needed them most... it was almost as if God had sent them to aid them.\n\"Ooooooooh!\"\n\"The spirits... the spirits have come to aid us!\"\n\"The hero, Izuna, brought the spirits here to save us!\"\n\"Lady Izuna!\"\n\"The Spirit Queen!\"\nThey fell for it. A few well placed individuals yelled out, establishing the mood. It was super effective! Not only were there more and more individuals that yelled Izuna’s name, but they were starting to call Dana the Spirit Queen.\n\"Zenon.\"\n[Am I finally able to show myself?]\nIt was perfect timing. No, it was even better. Zenon, who quietly resided within Ye Jin Jin’s dress, materialized himself. At that moment, her magic increased even further. Her magic was strong enough by just wearing the dress, but by materializing, Zenon increased Ye Jin Jin’s power even further!\n\"Indeed. The spirits have forgiven our past transgressions and have decided to help us! We can definitely overcome this hurdle! Together with the spirits! That must be what Sir Kay wished for as well!\"\n\"Uooooooooooh!\"\n\"Us humans won’t lose to the likes of you!\"\n\"The spirits came back for us... Aah, God is smiling down at us!\"\n\"Praise be the sun!\"\nTheir confidence soared as if they had become religious zealots! The madness of the battleground must’ve permeated into their brains. If it hadn’t, then the surface dwellers, who had been taught to hate the spirits, wouldn’t so easily accept the spirits! However, that was exactly what Lee Shin Woo had been aiming for.\n[We...We won’t lose!]\n[We will... retake the surface.]\n[The Emperor’s not at fault. He has always struggled to keep his people alive; the spirits are no exception!]\n[Then why... did you try killing us for so long?]\nThe mood had shifted entirely in the humans’ favor. The undead couldn’t win anymore. This part was critical. They needed to kill the undead, sure, but they couldn’t afford to kill the Heaven Defying General’s troops as well.\nNow they had to gradually play dead and retreat. It would prove to be incredibly complicated, but Lee Shin Woo had already prepared everything in advance. Dana, who’d appeared with such excellent timing, had been assigned a task that was just as important.\n’Allowing the Hero’s forces to escape. ...Using the Spirits’ Spring.’\n’The Hero is definitely a genius,’ Dana inwardly muttered. The spirits would appear at a critical moment, drawing everyone’s attention. And then, the Heaven Defying General’s troops would quietly retreat.\nNo matter how she thought about it, it wasn’t an idea that could be put together by a human. As expected, he was indeed the chosen hero!\n...However, when everything was falling into place...\n[...Don’t...]\n\"...Huh?\"\nDana tilted her head at the voice that resounded throughout the battlefield. She wasn’t the only one. Everyone on the battlefield heard that magical voice, forcing them to give up on the battle and focus entirely on the voice.\n[...Shoot.]\nThe voice gradually became clearer, and loudly resounded throughout the battlefield.\n[Don’t shoot...]\nAnd soon, everyone could hear it. Dana marveled its contents and the voice itself. What exactly was happening? Why was he personally intervening now?\nHowever, it was definitely him. Lee Shin Woo, who had overturned all logic and had created this stage, was yelling.\n[Stop, friendly fire! All of you... stop fighting!]\nThe battlefield froze. The sky and the ground were both shining.\nShe didn’t know what was happening, but she was sure of one thing... he was overturning all cause-and-effect.\n\"What is this...\"\nDana muttered vacantly and raised her hand. And she soon realized. Everyone else was undergoing the same evolution that she had.\nThe humans, the undead, and the spirits... they all obeyed his will. Seeing that, Dana just laughed despondently. She really had no choice.\n[If you’re all ready, then look and realize.]\nEveryone watched and experienced the world’s changes, and bowed before the god in front of them in worship.\nA god was performing a miracle.",

    "content": "<Epilogue. Stop, Friendly Fire!>\nLet’s turn back time a little bit to when Lee Shin Woo had come across the source of darkness.\n[Lv10 Source of Darkness - Lich Emperor’s Life Vessel]\nOnce he’d placed his hands upon the source of darkness, Lee Shin Woo came to a realization. That no one individual could bear this by themselves.\nThe level 9 Undead Emperor hadn’t stored this here and used it as his life vessel for no reason. He’d done this because no one could handle it. He had given up on controlling it and had used it as his life vessel instead!\n’I prepared myself for this, but... Shit, this is way too much!’\nWhat’s worse, there was an even bigger problem. Once Lee Shin Woo had approached it, the source of darkness recognized him and began unleashing a torrent of mana towards him.\nIt must’ve been affected by his maxed out darkness element. However, that wasn’t good for him right now. The source of darkness was so much stronger than Lee Shin Woo. If it kept unleashing its mana, then Lee Shin Woo’s body would disintegrate. It wasn’t on the level of Manatization. He would just become mana itself.\n\"Shin Woo, Shin Woo!?\"\n\"Don’t assimilate with me! You’ll die!\"\n\"Eut!\"\nLee Shin Woo screamed in anguish, and Jin froze solid. But she wouldn’t condone his death.\n\"What am I supposed to do if you die!? Then I really will die... You have to keep your promise and turn me human again!\"\n\"I won’t die right away. I can handle it with Invisible Heart. But you can’t! Your revival relies on darkness!\"\n\"Ugh...!\"\nHe was absolutely right. Jin had gone completely stiff. In the midst of that, Lee Shin Woo tried to absorb the source of darkness whole without getting sick.\nHe tried using his Manatization, Mana Acceleration, and Mana Bone skills to control the flow of mana, as well as all of his innate elements to twist cause-and-effect.\nBut it didn’t work at all. It was only natural! Ultimately, what it came down to was that all elements were controlled by mana! The pure darkness mana demolished all logic and cause-and-effect, and flooded Lee Shin Woo’s body.\n’Uaaaaaah! It hurts and it stings! But it’s also relaxing and feels good... Damn it, I really will die at this rate! It’s like I’m right about to lose consciousness atop a mountain!’\nThe term ’source’ was truly a fitting title for it. It was indeed the source of all darkness in this world. It felt as though half of this world was within it.\nAbsorbing it by himself? What a joke. It was like taking in half of the world’s population; it was impossible from the very start. Lee Shin Woo had miscalculated. It was a crucial miscalculation at that.\n’Then what am I supposed to do? If I don’t do something about this, then I can’t kill Jissehanu!’\nJissehanu had already begun using this as his life vessel. To completely eliminate the undead curse, Lee Shin Woo had to kill him, and to do that, he needed to destroy his life vessel as well. He hadn’t had any other choice from the very start.\nThen why!? He’d dealt with any absurdity his own way thus far, but he wasn’t able to deal with this one! No, if something like this actually existed, then God should’ve given him some warning beforehand!\n’What if I turn into a Titan? I may be able to contain all of this overwhelming mana... No, that’s not enough.’\nIf he were to use the Titan, then he’d only be switching his small soy sauce bowl for a soup bowl. He needed to absorb half the world itself, so it wouldn’t make much difference. On the contrary, by increasing the size of the medium, he might actually find it harder to control the mana.\n’There’s a solution somewhere. There has to be. If I were to fuse the innate elements together, then... Heaven Space? Dark Shadow? Use Annihilation Flame to sever the link? What if I were to eliminate the mana with Shining Flame as soon as I acquire it...’\nNo, it wouldn’t work. That would only work when Lee Shin Woo was in control of the darkness mana in question; it wouldn’t work since he couldn’t control this mana.\nThe situation was reversed. Lee Shin Woo wasn’t the master of this mana. Rather, the source of darkness was. The source of darkness was eating Lee Shin Woo, not the other way around.\nUsing the Titan? If he had, then it would’ve been a huge issue. Right now, the Titan Core was composed of the Demon Heart that originated from the Evil Eye ore; the Demon Heart had come from the source of darkness itself. If he’d used the Titan, then he would’ve been devoured in the blink of an eye.\nHe was really out of options. The Undead Emperor’s security hadn’t been lax; there had been no need for security in the first place. No, the fact that Jissehanu had managed to process such a great artifact and use it as his life vessel proved that he was a genius. A man extraordinary enough to aim for the surface!\n’What do I do? How do I go about this? What do I have to do to absorb all this mana? It’s not possible unless I were to become a god! It’s just way too much for me to absorb...!’\nDespair would always arise without a moment’s notice. And there usually wasn’t any way to deal with that despair. Lee Shin Woo recollected his long past death on Earth.\nYeah. This is what despair felt like when one was at the cusp of death. It had been such a shocking affair that Lee Shin Woo had asked God for immortality. He’d forgotten all about his original personality, beliefs, and skills, and pursued such a childish dream instead.\nAs a result, he was able to progress this far, which was shocking to him, but... ultimately, he was faced with despair.\n’This is unfair.’\nEverything’s unfair. Everyone he’d met must’ve thought that Lee Shin Woo was unfair.\n’This is absurd.’\nEverything’s absurd. Whenever he’d been faced with an absurd situation, he’d dealt with it with an equally absurd solution, so he really had no leg to stand on.\n’What’s worse, I can’t trick this thing.’\nTricking someone required that they have the minimum emotions, will, or what-not. However, the source of darkness didn’t have any of those. The reason this thing was emitting mana was purely because darkness was there.\nHe could understand how mountain climbers felt. There was a mountain there, so they climbed it. Though he wasn’t going to actually climb a mountain or anything.\n’...I guess there really isn’t anything I can do.’\nLee Shin Woo acknowledged his inability. It felt as though he wasn’t able to get to level 9 because he’d given up. But it couldn’t be helped. Others had often called him stubborn or overpowered, but Lee Shin Woo was fundamentally still a human who followed his set criteria and logic.\nEvery situation, which changed due to his silver tongue or skills, was nothing more than an event where he calculated the rate of success and/or failure.\nAnd so, the fact that he’d determined that he was out of options meant that this was truly the end. There was nothing he could do. After dying 210 times, he really would die.\n’However...’\nWhen he’d given up on everything, he thought of something.\n’Who said I couldn’t absorb this thing?’\nWho’d said that?\n’Who said I wasn’t a god?’\nWho’d said that?\n’I don’t think it was me.’\nLee Shin Woo thought about it. Since when was he a mortal? Since when had he become an imbecile that couldn’t absorb this small bead of darkness?\nHe didn’t think it was him. There was no reason he couldn’t absorb this thing.\n’No... I am a god.’\nWhen he thought about it, he was one. He’d eliminated the limitations of space, could nullify all barriers, had created a new race, had found the elusive Spirits’ Spring and had gone so far as to form a contract with it, and had even met another god, who was shocked by his existence.\nIf he wasn’t a god, then who was? Everything always went his way, so what else could this be but omnipotence?\n’I... can absorb it.’\nLee Shin Woo said naively. He forgot about everything else. He only briefly thought of logic, but soon couldn’t, as he sank through the surface of the ocean of thoughts.\nThat’s what he was doing within his subconscious. These ideas, that he wasn’t a god, that he wasn’t omnipotent, that he couldn’t absorb the source of darkness... all this logic that emerged within his mind was cast aside and ultimately eliminated.\nAnd when none were able to even comprehend what this stupid and hopeless man was attempting...\n’There’s no way I can’t absorb it. It’s only half the world. It’s nothing compared to what I’ve done thus far. It’s a piece of cake.’\nLee Shin Woo truly believed that he was a god. He truly believed that he could absorb the source of darkness.\nAt that moment, everything changed.\n[The Acting skill has been maxed out!]\n[The Wild Card skill has been maxed out! All of the Joker’s innate skills increase its power! For anyone connected to you, cause-and-effect flows however you wish! The Combat Sense skill has been absorbed by Wild Card.]\nFirst off, the Acting and Wild Card skills were mastered. Better yet, the Combat Sense skill was also absorbed by his Wild Card skill!\nWhen he had first acquired the Wild Card skill, he had realized that by absorbing his other skills, it allowed him to wield them more naturally and with greater power than before.\nHowever, Lee Shin Woo didn’t feel inspired by it at all. Not only was it not important right now, but why was it leveling up right now?\nHe soon underwent a full-blown change.\n[The Manatization skill has become Lv10 and has been maxed out! Health and Magic have increased by 200! You can now convert your entire body into mana. However, with your talent, you can ’define’ yourself however you wish! The skill has been absorbed by Wild Card!]\n[With a body of a mortal, you have dared to define yourself as a God. This is, above all else, an act of rebellion against the gods! The Rebellion skill has become Lv10 and has been maxed out! All stats have increased by 200! You now have the right to destroy all rules! The Rebellion and Soul Strike skills have been absorbed by Wild Card!]\n[The Disguise skill has become Lv10 and has been maxed out. A disguise must be so perfect that it fools even oneself! You have realized this truth, and have ultimately become a true Joker. You now have the right to become level 9! All the Joker’s innate skills have been absorbed by Wild Card!]\nIn order to master the Disguise skill, as well as become a true Joker, one must first fool themselves.\nWhile he was able to fool others rather easily, he’d feigned ignorance, knowingly tying himself down to reason and logic. Only be completely fooling himself could he become a true Joker!\n[The Mana Acceleration and High Rank Mana Bone skills have become Lv10, and have been maxed out. Magic has increased by 500. The two skills have been absorbed by Wild Card!]\n[The High Rank Assimilation skill has become Lv10 and has been maxed out. Agility and Magic have increased by 150. The skill is absorbed by Wild Card!]\nIn an instant, half of his skills had been absorbed by Wild Card, but Lee Shin Woo didn’t feel empty at all.\nBecause it meant that Lee Shin Woo had mastered all of his skills to such an extent that he could use them through Wild Card now. However, the true change would now begin.\n[Assimilating with the source of darkness. It has now lost its ability to function as the Lich Emperor’s life vessel.]\n[You have acquired the level 9 Joker’s karma.]\nAs if his efforts to resist the source of darkness were in vain, Lee Shin Woo’s body briefly dispersed and assimilated with the source of darkness. Jin screamed, but there was nothing for her to be worried about.\nHe was just in the process of leveling up. There was such a nice tank of mana right before him, so he decided to use that for his level up first.\n[Absorbing the source of darkness’s magic by assimilating with it. Magic has increased by 2,000.]\n[You have gained a deep understanding of all abilities that handle bones, and you can now use your abilities even if the medium is not bone. The Bone Reinforcement, Rule of Bone, and Bone Armory skills have been absorbed by Wild Card. You can now absorb, reinforce, and store all of creation as you wish. All stats have increased by 500.]\n[Absorbing the source of darkness’s magic by assimilating with it. Magic has increased by 1,968.]\n[The High Rank Command skill has become Lv10 and has been maxed out. All stats have increased by 50. You have surpassed the limitations of species and mediums, and are now able to command all creation. The skill has been absorbed by Wild Card.]\n[Absorbing the source of darkness’s magic by assimilating with it. Magic has increased by 278.]\n[Absorbing the source of darkness’s magic by assimilating with it. Magic has increased by 1,109.]\nWhile his existence was being upgraded, he continuously absorbed the source of darkness’s magic. His form hadn’t coalesced yet, so he could just define it as he saw fit. That was, of course, after he’d fully absorbed the source of darkness.\n[Absorbing the source of darkness’s magic by assimilating with it. Magic has increased by 1,879. It is no longer possible to absorb any more magic; your soul has reached the maximum capacity.]\n[You have become a Joker. You can choose whatever form you wish, and are the world’s clown, one who can define all of creation as you see fit.]\n[You have fooled your own soul and have completely absorbed the source of darkness. Your magic is temporarily increased by 29,873. However, if this magic is not dealt with soon, then you, as well as the world, will be in danger.]\n[With the sudden surge of magic, you have, for an extremely short period of time, become a god. However, not only is this unstable and temporary but if you do not resolve this quickly, then you and all you are connected to will receive negative karma.]\nLee Shin Woo panted. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo’s body reappeared. He looked similar to how he did before he’d disappeared, but there was one thing that was different. His existence had become so great that it made breathing difficult for Jin.\n\"Shin Woo, are you ok!?\"\n\"I’m not ok. I feel sick to my stomach.\"\nLee Shin Woo spoke with a haggard expression and dry heaved. By reaching level 9, leveling up all his skills, and absorbing the source of darkness ’normally’, his Magic stat had increased by a whopping 37,327.\nCompared to before, it was shocking. Since he’d gotten to level 9 with 12,000 stats to spare! [1]\n[Lee Shin Woo]\n[Joker]\n[Immortal Hunter; 25 others]\nLv - 9 (Status Effectiveness 400%)]\n[Strength - 5,265, Agility - 5,695, Health - 5,578, Magic - 20,789]\n[Passive skills - Wild Card: MAX, Invisible Heart Lv4/Lv210, Lucky Strike Lv7, Soul Seeing Eye Lv6]\n[Active skills - High Rank Regeneration Lv7, Sacrifice Lv1]\n[Elements - Darkness: MAX, Light: MAX, Fire: MAX, Intermediate Dark Shadow Lv3, Intermediate Annihilation Flame Lv2, Intermediate Heaven Space Lv1, Beginner Shining Flame Lv8, Intermediate Dark Flame Lv7, Beginner Fire Shadow Lv8, High Rank Water Lv4, High Rank Wind Lv3, High Rank Earth Lv3, High Rank Metal Lv4, High Rank Ice Lv1, High Rank Acid Lv4, High Rank Lightning Lv6, Absorption Lv12]\n[Resistances - Holy: MAX, Darkness: MAX, Light: MAX, Fire: MAX, Beginner Shining Flame Lv1, Intermediate Dark Flame Lv1, High Rank Water Lv3, High Rank Wind Lv3, High Rank Earth Lv4, High Rank Acid Lv3, High Rank Ice Lv1, High Rank Lightning Lv5]\nBut the problem was that in spite of his efforts, he still couldn’t fully absorb the source of darkness. He’d managed to fool himself and absorb the source of darkness, putting it under his control, but that was only temporary.\nIn other words, Lee Shin Woo had acquired an excess of 29,873 magic, and as a result, his stats had surpassed 51,200... He had temporarily become level 10 and had become a god.\n\"A god!?\"\n\"I really can’t eat this thing. Well, I can... but I can’t. You get me?\"\n\"I get it. I get it, alright, so don’t explain it to me!\"\nHe knew he wasn’t in good shape. Lee Shin Woo’s current situation was akin to him eating something until he was full and stubbornly saying that ’No, I can keep eating!’. He had kept eating until he’d gone past his limits and as a result, he’d managed to eat all of it. But if he were to move, he felt like he’d vomit the source of darkness up, look indescribable, and fall over.\n\"I told you not to explain!\"\n’I have to deal with it. I have to take care of it right away!’ Lee Shin Woo thought and soon came up with a good idea. By that point, he was already within the palace’s hall. Yeah, in the very same hall where the two level 9 Emperors were fighting.\nLee Shin Woo could now teleport wherever he wished with but a thought. Unfortunately, this was something that any level 9 could do, so he couldn’t waste his magic experimenting with it.\n[What!?]\n[T-The source of darkness... My life vessel, did you...!?]\n\"Hey boys. Sorry, but I don’t have the time to talk with you right now. Rest in peace!\"\nLee Shin Woo swept his hands at the equally shocked Jirold and Jissehanu. That was the end for them. The Vampire and the Lich without his life vessel died. He didn’t concern himself with their history, their regrets, or their situations; he just mercilessly killed them. What futile deaths.\nThe process was even worse; it was close to a miracle. Lee Shin Woo had so much spare magic to spend that he could perform miracles! With a god’s power, he could easily deceive and patch up this world’s unstable karma.\n[By senselessly using a god’s power, Magic has permanently decreased by 32.]\n\"It’s not enough!\"\nIn the midst of that, Lee Shin Woo collected the bones and Perium that Jirold and Jissehanu had left behind, and widened his eyes. When he thought about it, it truly was outrageous. Originally, Lee Shin Woo had learned not only magic but also innate elements and martial arts.\nHe had reached level 9 and was already at a level where he could easily kill the two Emperors; even though he’d used such an outrageous technique, the penalties weren’t very high!\n\"This is nothing! What exactly do I have to do... Ah, that’s right!\"\nA greater miracle. The more people affected by it, the greater the penalty. God herself had explained it, hadn’t she? The more she influences others’ karma, the greater the penalty!\n’Then, let’s think,’ Lee Shin Woo thought. What place could he enact a miracle where the most people would be affected? It was obvious! It was none other than the Setoin Plains, where the undead and the humans were fighting their very last battle!\n\"Shin Woo!\"\n\"Jin, I’m going ahead!\"\nBefore he left for the surface, Jin had rushed out of the cave with speed befitting a ’Child of Light’. She was just completely shocked. To think he’d killed the two Emperors so quickly! When did he even do that!?\n\"Hey, what exactly did you...\"\n\"I don’t have much time, so I’m going ahead. Ah, Jin! Congratulations on becoming human again!\"\n\"...Huh? Huuuuh?\"\nOnce he’d ’informed’ her of this, Jin changed. It was such a dramatic, yet natural transformation that Jin had no choice but to accept it.\nShe, a skeleton horse, was in the process of changing into a human... She closed her eyes at her truly miraculous transformation and at the end of it, had turned into a true human. She opened her eyes, saw Lee Shin Woo, and was able to move. Of course, Lee Shin Woo had already disappeared from the underground.\n\"Damn it. You asshole! You’re always so confusing... Ugh, I like it though! Still, I don’t like it! Wait, no, I like it, but... Ugh, who am I even talking to.\"\nThe sprinter who represented the U.K, the blond-and-blue-eyed beauty, Jin Taylor.\nContrary to when Lee Shin Woo had used Disguise on her before, she was naked; she pointlessly looked over her beautiful, nude form and eventually used Steel Heart to cover herself in metal armor.\nShe had instantaneously become a battle angel, like the ones who came from North European myth, a Valkyrie.\nJin meticulously looked over the joints of her armor, and then folded the steel wings on her back...\n\"Wait for me, you dumbass partner of mine!\"\nShe ran like lightning across the Underground Empire. Jin made it to the surface in just 1 minute. ...Though by then, everything was over.\n[Stop, friendly fire!]\nLee Shin Woo, who’ve come to the surface, yelled out. Everyone’s attention was drawn to the powerful mana he was releasing.\n[Fighting against each other is pointless!]\n’Though, I was the one who instigated this fight,’ he thought.\n[There’s no need to divide yourself into human and undead. You just briefly went astray due to unfortunate events!]\nThough calling ’hating each other for hundreds of years’ going astray was a bit much.\n[I’ll set you straight. I’ll give you another chance so that you can all work together and start anew!]\nOf course, no matter how many chances humans were given, they would eventually fight amongst each other. Therefore, his actions would have no lasting effect, but he couldn’t say that ’this is all for my sake!’ or ’this is just for show!’.\n[Those who want to live will live, and those who want to die will die. The righteous will receive, and the unrighteous will lose!]\nWhenever he spoke, Lee Shin Woo could feel the bloated mana quickly begin to dissipate.\nHe was quite satisfied. As expected, what he was doing could truly be called a miracle!\n\"How... How did the deceased Sir Kay return?\"\n\"A dead person has come back.\"\n\"The undead... are becoming human.\"\n\"How exactly did he...? Sir Kay? Sir Kay has become a god and returned to us! To save us!\"\n[There’s no need to doubt. Just graciously accept what you’ve been given. Stop fighting. You’re all in the same position, so hate has no purpose here!]\nHe was repeatedly saying such contemptible words that he’d never say in a thousand years.\nHowever, his actions had stopped the fighting, so in a way, he’d succeeded.\n\"Aah, Sir Kay...!\"\n\"I was definitely an undead! Did he make me human again!?\"\nThey weren’t the only ones who’d experienced changes; his subordinates had as well. Dana, who was in the boundary between life and death, hadn’t experienced much change, but Shino and Seira, who were completely undead, were absolutely speechless.\n\"Lee Shin Woo, what exactly...\"\n\"Did you finally become a god...?\"\nEven Seira kneeled before his miracle. Like the others, she was overcome by the emotions welling up from within her and bowed her head.\nIt didn’t really matter that he’d turned his well-planned scenario on its head! After all, a play was the most fun when something unexpected happened!\n’Ah, I don’t think that’ll be enough.’\nWhereas, Lee Shin Woo, who was performing a miracle, saw his Magic rapidly declining to its original values and felt slightly impatient. But if need be, he had a solution ready. He felt like if he were to use the reserve stock of Invisible Heart and Sacrifice, then it’d work out somehow!\n’Moreover... Perium! Yeah, it’ll work out if I just use all this as well!’ Fresh chapters posted on Nov3lFɪre.ɴet\nThough it was only temporary, Lee Shin Woo was level 10. Lee Shin Woo’s instinctual understanding of the world’s karma had increased greatly. Thus, he could understand.\nThat Perium was the energy that acted as the very foundation of all karma and was the smallest unit of karma. And that Invisible Heart was the crystallization of God’s power!\nBy using those two to support his miracle, he came to a natural realization. And thus, he took another unplanned step forward.\n[By performing a miracle, which is only possible for gods, you have demanded admiration from all. You have acquired the title, ’God’s representative’. You have fulfilled a portion of the conditions of becoming a god. You have acquired the right to wield divinity.]\n[You have learned the fusion element of light and darkness, the ’Chaos’ Element Lv1. The Chaos Element is categorized as divinity and is the most powerful element. It will eventually lead you to creation. Born as a clown, you have become able to overturn the laws of destruction and creation, and you are now prepared to accomplish everything and anything with only the chaos element. All stats have increased by 100.]\n[You were able to absorb a portion of the source of darkness’s indigestible magic! Magic has increased by 1,597!]\nBy acquiring a title and the chaos element, Lee Shin Woo’s soul had advanced a step further! If he took into account everything he’d used up, then... He was good now! Lee Shin Woo had used up all the magic and successfully digested it! He finally got a hold of himself and raised his head.\nAll of creation were subordinating themselves to him.\n\"God.\"\n\"God...\"\nLee Shin Woo was level 10 no longer. He was definitely no god. However, the people’s gazes remained fixed on him in the sky and they prayed. The people and the once undead did as well.\nIt was just an impromptu performance to rid himself of the excess magic, yet the result was, well... They were giving him so much support that it felt like he was a performer on Broadway!\n’The hell? In the end, nothing went my way... It’s chaos. If I knew it’d turn out like this, then I wouldn’t have gone through all the effort to make the play!’\nLee Shin Woo looked around with an insufferable expression.\nTowards Seira, who was bowing halfway towards him, Shino Rendu, who was outright prostrating himself, Chi Paul, who was looking up with such respect, the stiffened Lloyd and Erian, who couldn’t figure out what was going on, Prince, who’d already fainted, Kratia, who was looking at him with sparkling eyes, Ye Jin Jin, who looked at him with love-struck eyes, Dana, who was long past affection and looked upon him with reverence, Sinea, etc...\n\"Shin Wooooooooo! Why weren’t you there when I wanted to share my joy with you!? You have to at least let me thank you!\"\nNow he looked at Jin, who was hacking and looking up at him... Lee Shin Woo finally let his shoulders slump. It felt like he had been brought back to reality. It was as if he was astonished himself and spoke with a weak voice.\n\"Mm... I somehow managed to change everyone. Jin, it worked out well for you, right?\"\n\"Can you really... say that now!?\"\nThe angered Jin rushed towards Lee Shin Woo. Obviously, those watching Lee Shin Woo rushed towards Jin. At this rate, Jin would get hurt!\nLee Shin Woo hurriedly hugged Jin and yelled. His voice was loud enough that it covered the entire world.\n\"Stop, friendly fire! Don’t fire! She’s an ally!\"\nAnd thus, the curtains were drawn for the Joker’s performance.\nWhat started as a battle between the humans and the undead had ended in a miraculous unity. The events of the day were the talk of the town and became known as the most important day on the continent.\n\"So, Shin Woo. What about the Titan? How was it? Was it strong? Since it was made by me and you. It was really strong, right? You killed the Emperor in one hit with it, right?\"\n\"Ah... About that, Kratia. You know what a MacGuffin is, right? If you don’t, then I’ll explain it to you. You see, the term MacGuffin originated in the northern mountains of Scotland and was used when capturing lions, but it’s actually...\"\n[1] T/N: He doesn’t include the 29,873.",
